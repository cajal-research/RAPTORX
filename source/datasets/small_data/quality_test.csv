There are many ways to deliver OA: personal web sites, blogs, wikis, databases, ebooks, videos, audios, webcasts, discussion forums, RSS feeds, and P2P networks.
 
                                          Unless creative thinking stops now, there will be many more to come.
However, two delivery vehicles dominate the current discussion: journals and repositories.
OA journals are like non-OA journals except that they’re OA. Making good on that exception requires a new funding model, but nearly everything else about the journal could be held constant, if we wanted to hold it constant. Some OA journals are very traditional except that they’re OA, while others deliberately push the evolution of journals as a category. (Some toll-access journals also push that evolution, if we don’t count stopping short of OA.)
Like conventional, toll-access journals, some OA journals are first-rate and some are bottom feeders. Like conventional journals, some OA journals are high in prestige and some are unknown, and some of the unknowns are high in quality and some are low. Some are on solid financial footing and some are struggling. Also like conventional journals, most are honest and some are scams.
As early as 2004, Thomson Scientific found that “in each of the broad subject areas studied there was at least one OA title that ranked at or near the top of its field” in citation impact. The number of high-quality, high-impact OA journals has only grown since.
Unlike toll-access journals, however, most OA journals are new. It’s hard to generalize about OA journals beyond saying that they have all the advantages of being OA and all the disadvantages of being new.
 
                                          To be more precise: A disappointing number of OA journals don’t have all the advantages of being OA because they retain needless permission barriers. (See section 3.3 on gratis and libre OA.) At the same time, a heartening number of OA journals no longer suffer from the disadvantages of being new.
Like conventional journal publishers, some OA journal publishers are for-profit and some are nonprofit. Like conventional publishers, there are a few large OA publishers and a long tail of small ones, although the largest OA publishers are small compared to the largest conventional publishers. Unlike conventional publishers, the profitable for-profit OA publishers have moderate rather than obscene profit margins.
OA repositories are online collections or databases of articles. Unlike OA journals, OA repositories have no counterpart in the traditional landscape of scholarly communication. That makes them woefully easy to overlook or misunderstand.
By default, new deposits in OA repositories are OA. But most repositories today support
dark deposits
, which can be switched to OA at a later date. Most OA repositories were launched to host peer-reviewed research articles and their preprints. But often they include other sorts of content as well, such as theses and dissertations, datasets, courseware, and digitized copies of works from the special collections of the hosting institution’s library. For scholars, repositories are better at making work OA than personal web sites because repositories provide persistent URLs, take steps for long-term preservation, and don’t disappear when the author changes jobs or dies.
3.1 Green and Gold OA
Gold and green OA differ in at least two fundamental respects.
First, OA journals and repositories differ in their relationship to peer review. OA journals perform their own peer review, just like conventional journals. Repositories generally don’t perform peer review, although they host and disseminate articles peer-reviewed elsewhere. As a result, gold and green OA differ in their support costs and in the roles they can play in the scholarly communications universe.
Terminology
The OA movement uses the term
gold OA
for OA delivered by journals, regardless of the journal’s business model, and
green OA
for OA delivered by repositories.
Self-archiving
is the practice of depositing one’s own work in an OA repository. All three of these terms were coined by Stevan Harnad.
Second, OA journals obtain the rights or permissions they need directly from the rightsholders, while repositories ask depositors to obtain the needed rights or permissions on their own. Even when the depositors are the authors themselves, they may already have transferred key rights to publishers. As a result, OA journals can generate permission for reuse at will, and OA repositories generally cannot. Hence, most libre OA is gold OA, even if it’s not yet the case that most gold OA is libre OA. (See more in section 3.3 on gratis and libre OA.)
Gold and green OA require different steps from authors. To make new articles gold OA, authors simply submit their manuscripts to OA journals, as they would to conventional journals. To make articles green OA, authors simply deposit their manuscripts in an OA repository.
Most importantly, the green/gold distinction matters because if authors can’t make their work OA one way, they can make it OA the other way. One of the most persistent and damaging misunderstandings is that all OA is gold OA. Authors who can’t find a high-quality, high-prestige OA journal in their field, or whose submissions are rejected from first-rate OA journals, often conclude that they must give up on OA or publish in a second-rate journal. But that’s hasty. If they publish in the best toll-access journal that will accept their work, then—more often than not—they may turn around and deposit the peer-reviewed manuscript in an OA repository. Most toll-access publishers and toll-access journals give blanket permission for green OA, many others will give permission on request, and the numbers approach 100 percent when authors are subject to green OA mandates from their funding agencies or universities. (More in chapters 4 on OA policies and 10 on making your own work OA.)
One of the early victories of the OA movement was to get a majority of toll-access publishers and journals to give blanket permission for author-initiated green OA. But this victory remains one of the best-kept secrets of scholarly publishing, and widespread ignorance of it is the single most harmful consequence of green OA’s invisibility. Overlooking this victory reduces the volume of OA and creates the false impression that a trade-off between prestige and OA is common when in fact it is rare. Forgetting that green OA is compatible with conventional publishing also feeds the false impression that policies requiring green OA actually require gold OA and thereby limit the freedom of authors to submit work to the journals of their choice. (More in chapter 4 on policies.)
Most publishing scholars will choose prestige over OA if they have to choose. The good news is that they rarely have to choose. The bad news is that few of them know that they rarely have to choose. Few realize that most toll-access journals permit author-initiated green OA, despite determined efforts to explain and publicize this early victory for green OA.
There are two reasons why OA is compatible with prestigious publication, a gold reason and a green one. The gold reason is that a growing number of OA journals have already earned high levels of prestige, and others are steadily earning it. If there are no prestigious OA journals in your field today, you could wait (things are changing fast), you could help out (by submitting your best work), or you could move on to green. The green reason why OA is compatible with prestige is that most toll-access journals, including the prestigious, already allow OA archiving. As noted, this “most” can become “all” with the aid of an effective OA policy. (See chapter 4 on policies.)
The most useful OA repositories comply with the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (PMH), which makes separate repositories play well together. In the jargon, OAI compliance makes repositories
interoperable
, allowing the worldwide network of individual repositories to behave like a single grand virtual repository that can be searched all at once. It means that users can find a work in an OAI-compliant repository without knowing which repositories exist, where they are located, or what they contain. (OA and OAI are separate but overlapping initiatives.)
Most of the major academic and nonacademic search engines crawl OA journals and OA repositories. For example, Google, Bing, and Yahoo all do this and do it from self-interest. These search engines now provide another method (beyond OAI-based interoperability) for searching across the whole network of repositories without knowing what exists where. A common misunderstanding sees OA repositories as walled gardens that make work hard to find by requiring readers to make separate visits to separate repositories to run separate searches. The reverse is true in two senses: OA repositories make work easier to find, and toll-access collections are the ones more likely to be walled gardens, either invisible to search engines or requiring separate visits and separate searches.
Disciplinary
repositories (also called
subject
repositories) try to capture all the research in a given field, while
institutional
repositories try to capture all the research from a given institution. Because both kinds tend to be OAI-compliant and interoperable, the differences matter very little for readers. Readers who want to browse a repository for serendipity are more likely to find useful content in a disciplinary repository in the right field than in an institutional repository. But most scholars find repository content by keyword searches, not by browsing, and through cross-archive searches, not through local single-repository searches.
However, the differences between disciplinary and institutional repositories matter more for authors. On the one hand, institutions are in a better position than disciplines to offer incentives and assistance for deposit, and to adopt policies to ensure deposit. A growing number of universities do just that. On the other hand, scholars who regularly read research in a large disciplinary repository, such as arXiv for physics or PubMed Central for medicine, readily grasp the rationale for depositing their work in OA repositories and need less nudging to do so themselves. (More in chapter 4 on policies.)
Because most publishers and journals already give blanket permission for green OA, the burden is on authors to take advantage of it. In the absence of an institutional policy to encourage or require deposits, the spontaneous rate of deposit is about 15 percent. Institutions requiring deposit can push the rate toward 100 percent over a few years.
The reason the spontaneous rate is lower than the nudged, assisted, and mandated rate is rarely opposition to OA itself. Almost always it’s unfamiliarity with green OA (belief that all OA is gold OA), misunderstanding of green OA (belief that it violates copyright, bypasses peer review, or forecloses the possibility of publishing in a venerable journal), and fear that it is time-consuming. In this sense, author unfamiliarity and misunderstanding are greater obstacles to OA than actual opposition, whether from authors or publishers.
The remedies are already spreading worldwide: launching more OA journals and repositories, educating researchers about their gold and green OA options, and adopting intelligent policies to encourage gold OA and require green OA. (More in chapter 4 on OA policies.)
3.2 Green and Gold as Complementary
Some friends of OA focus their energy on green OA and some focus on gold OA. Some support both kinds about equally and have merely specialized. But some give one a higher strategic priority than the other. I’ll argue that green and gold OA are complementary and synergistic. We should pursue them simultaneously, much as an organism must develop its nervous system and digestive system simultaneously.
Fortunately, this synergy is served even by differences of opinion about its existence. The fact that some activists give green OA a higher priority than gold, and some the reverse, creates a natural division of labor ensuring that good people are working hard on each front.
Green OA has some advantages over gold OA. It makes faster progress, since it doesn’t require the launch of new peer-reviewed journals or the conversion of old ones. For the same reason, it’s less expensive than gold OA and can scale up quickly and inexpensively to meet demand, while the bulk of the money needed to scale up OA journals is still tied up in subscriptions to toll-access journals.
Green OA can be mandated without infringing academic freedom, but gold OA cannot. (More precisely, gold OA can’t be mandated without infringing academic freedom until virtually all peer-reviewed journals are OA, which isn’t on the horizon.) A green OA policy at a university can cover the institution’s entire research output, regardless of where authors choose to publish, while a gold OA policy can only cover the new articles that faculty are willing to submit to OA journals.
Green OA is compatible with toll-access publication. Sometimes this is because toll-access publishers hold the needed rights and decide to allow it, and sometimes because authors retain the needed rights. Well-drafted OA policies can ensure that authors always retain the needed rights and spare them the need to negotiate with publishers. (See chapters 4 on policies and 6 on copyright.)
When the best journals in a field are toll-access—often the case today even if changing—green OA allows authors to have their cake and eat it too. Authors good enough to publish in the best journals may do so and still make their work OA, without waiting for high-prestige OA journals to emerge in their fields. When promotion and tenure committees create strong incentives to publish in venerable toll-access journals—often the case today even if changing—green OA allows authors to make their work OA without bucking institutional incentives or relinquishing institutional rewards.
Green OA works for preprints as well as postprints, while gold OA only works for postprints. For the same reason, green OA works for other kinds of work that peer-reviewed journals generally don’t publish, such as datasets, source code, theses and dissertations, and digitized copies of work previously available only in another medium such as print, microfiche, or film.
On the other side, gold OA has some advantages over green OA. Gold OA articles needn’t labor under restrictions imposed by toll-access publishers fearful of OA. Hence, gold OA is always immediate, while green OA is sometimes embargoed or delayed. Similarly, gold OA can always be libre, even if it doesn’t take sufficient advantage of this opportunity, while green OA seldom even has the opportunity. (See chapter 4 on policies.)
Gold OA provides OA to the published version, while green OA is often limited to the final version of the author’s peer-reviewed manuscript, without copy editing or final pagination. Making the OA edition the same as the published edition reduces the confusion caused by the circulation of multiple versions.
Gold OA performs its own peer review, without depending on toll-access journals to perform it. Hence support for gold OA supports the survival of peer review itself in case toll-access journals can no longer provide it.
Finally, green OA may be a manageable expense, but gold OA can be self-sustaining, even profitable.
Librarians traditionally distinguish four functions performed by scholarly journals: Registration (time stamp), certification (peer review), awareness (distribution), and archiving (preservation). We know that green and gold OA are complementary as soon as we recognize that green is better than gold for registration (its time stamps are faster) and preservation, and that gold OA is better than green OA for certification (peer review).
Some see green OA mainly as a tool to force a transition to gold OA. The idea is that rising levels of green OA will trigger the cancellation of conventional journals and pressure them to convert to gold OA. The growing volume of green OA might have this effect. Some publishers fear that it will, and some OA activists hope that it will. But it might not have this effect at all. One piece of evidence is that green OA hasn’t triggered journal cancellations in physics, where levels of green OA approach 100 percent and have been high and growing for nearly two decades. (More in chapter 8 on casualties.) Even if it did have this effect, however, it wouldn’t follow that it is the best strategy for advancing gold OA. There are good prospects for a peaceful revolution based on publisher consent and self-interest. (More in chapter 7 on economics.)
Most importantly, however, we’ll still want green OA in a world where all peer-reviewed journals are OA. For example, we’ll want green OA for preprints and for the earliest possible time-stamp to establish the author’s priority. We’ll want green OA for datasets, theses and dissertations, and other research genres not published in journals. We’ll want green OA for the security of having multiple OA copies in multiple independent locations. (Even today, the best OA journals not only distribute their articles from their own web sites but also deposit copies in independent OA repositories.) At least until the very last conventional journal converts to OA, we’ll need green OA so that research institutions can mandate OA without limiting the freedom of authors to submit to the journals of their choice. We’ll even want OA repositories as the distribution mechanism for many OA journals themselves.
A worldwide network of OA repositories would support one desirable evolution of what we now call journals. It would allow us to decouple peer review from distribution. Peer review could be performed by freestanding editorial boards and distribution by the network of repositories. Decoupling would remove the perverse incentive for peer-review providers to raise access barriers or impede distribution. It would also remove their perverse incentive to demand exclusive rights over research they didn’t fund, perform, write up, or buy from the authors.
On the other side, we’ll still want gold OA in a world where all new articles are green OA. High-volume green OA may not have caused toll-access journal cancellations yet, even in fields where green OA approaches 100 percent. But we can’t say that it will never do so, and we can’t say that every field will behave like physics in this respect. If peer-reviewed toll-access journals are not sustainable (see section 2.1), then the survival of peer review will depend on a shift to peer-reviewed OA journals.
It won’t matter whether toll-access journals are endangered by rising levels of green OA, by their own hyperinflationary price increases, or by their failure to scale with the rapid growth of new research. If any combination of these causes puts peer-reviewed toll-access journals in jeopardy, then peer review will depend on OA journals, which are not endangered by any of those causes. (In chapter 8 on casualties, we’ll see evidence that toll-access journal price increases cause many more cancellations than green OA does.)
Finally, if all new articles are green OA, we’ll still want the advantages that are easier for gold OA than for green OA to provide: freedom from permission barriers, freedom from delays or embargoes, and freedom from ever-rising drains on library budgets.
Neither green nor gold OA will suffice, long-term or short-term. That’s a reason to pursue both.
3.3 Gratis and Libre OA
Sometimes we must speak unambiguously about two subspecies of OA. One removes price barriers alone and the other removes price barriers and at least some permission barriers. The former is
gratis OA
and the latter
libre OA
.
To sharpen their definitions, we need a quick detour into fair use. In the United States, fair use is an exception to copyright law allowing users to reproduce copyrighted work “for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching . . . , scholarship, or research” (to quote the U.S. copyright statute).
Fair use has four characteristics that matter to us here. First, the permission for fair use is granted by law and needn’t be sought from the copyright holder. Or equivalently, the statute assures us that no permission is needed because fair use “is not an infringement of copyright.” Second, the permission is limited and doesn’t cover all the uses that scholars might want to make. To exceed fair use, users must obtain permission from the copyright holder. Third, most countries have some equivalent of fair use, though they differ significantly in what they allow and disallow. Finally, fair use is vague. There are clear cases of fair use (quoting a short snippet in a review) and clear cases of exceeding fair use (reprinting a full-text book), but the boundary between the two is fuzzy and contestable.
Gratis OA is free of charge but not more free than that. Users must still seek permission to exceed fair use. Gratis OA removes price barriers but not permission barriers.
Libre OA is free of charge and also free of some copyright and licensing restrictions. Users have permission to exceed fair use, at least in certain ways. Because there are many ways to exceed fair use, there are many degrees or kinds of libre OA. Libre OA removes price barriers and at least some permission barriers.
Fortunately, we don’t always need these terms. Indeed, in most of this book I use “OA” without qualification. The generic term causes no trouble until we need to talk about differences between gratis and libre OA, just as “carbohydrate” causes no trouble until we need to talk about differences between simple and complex carbohydrates.
I’m borrowing the gratis/libre language from the world of software, where it expresses the same distinction. If the terms sound odd in English, it’s because English doesn’t have more domesticated terms for this distinction. Their oddity in English may even be an advantage, since the terms don’t carry extra baggage, as “open” and “free” do, which therefore helps us avoid ambiguity.
First note that the gratis/libre distinction is not the same as the green/gold distinction. The gratis/libre distinction is about user rights or freedoms, while the green/gold distinction is about venues or vehicles. Gratis/libre answers the question,
how open is it?
Green/gold answers the question,
how is it delivered?
Green OA can be gratis or libre but is usually gratis. Gold OA can be gratis or libre, but is also usually gratis. However, it’s easier for gold OA to be libre than for green OA to be libre, which is why the campaign to go beyond gratis OA to libre OA focuses more on journals than repositories.
If users encounter a full-text work online without charge, then they know it’s gratis OA. They don’t have to be told, even if they’d like to be told—for example, so that they don’t have to wonder whether they’re reading an illicit copy. But users can’t figure out whether a work is libre OA unless the provider (author or publisher) tells them. This is the purpose of a
license
, which is simply a statement from the copyright holder explaining what users may and may not do with a given work.
Works under “all-rights-reserved” copyrights don’t need licenses, because “all rights reserved” means that without special permission users may do nothing that exceeds fair use.
The default around the world today is that new works are copyrighted from birth (no registration required), that the copyright initially belongs to the author (but is transferrable by contract), and that the rights holder reserves all rights. Authors who want to provide libre OA must affirmatively waive some of their rights and use a license to tell users they’ve done so. For convenience, let’s say that an
open license
is one allowing some degree of libre OA.
Although the word “copyright” is singular, it covers a plurality of rights, and authors may waive some and retain others. They may do so in any combination that suits their needs. That’s why there are many nonequivalent open licenses and nonequivalent types of libre OA. What’s important here is that waiving some rights in order to provide libre OA does not require waiving all rights or waiving copyright altogether. On the contrary, open licenses presuppose copyright, since they express permissions from the copyright holder. Moreover, the rights not waived are fully enforceable. In the clear and sensible language of Creative Commons, open licenses create “some-rights-reserved” copyrights rather than “all-rights-reserved” copyrights.
The open licenses from Creative Commons (CC) are the best-known and most widely used. But there are other open licenses, and authors and publishers can always write their own. To illustrate the range of libre OA, however, it’s convenient to look at the CC licenses.
The maximal degree of libre OA belongs to works in the public domain. Either these works were never under copyright or their copyrights have expired. Works in the public domain may be used in any way whatsoever without violating copyright law. That’s why it’s lawful to translate or reprint Shakespeare without hunting down his heirs for permission. Creative Commons offers CC0 (CC-Zero) for copyright holders who want to assign their work to the public domain.
The CC Attribution license (CC-BY) describes the least restrictive sort of libre OA after the public domain. It allows any use, provided the user attributes the work to the original author. This is the license recommended by the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA) and the SPARC Europe Seal of Approval program for OA journals.
 
                                          I support this recommendation, use CC-BY for my blog and newsletter, and request CC-BY whenever I publish in a journal.
CC supports several other open licenses as well, including CC-BY-NC, which requires attribution and blocks commercial use, and CC-BY-ND, which requires attribution and allows commercial use but blocks derivative works. These licenses are not equivalent to one another, but they all permit uses beyond fair use and therefore they all represent different flavors of libre OA.
While you can write your own open licenses or use those created by others, the advantage of CC licenses is that they are ready-made, lawyer-drafted, enforceable, understood by a large and growing number of users, and available in a large and growing number of legal jurisdictions. Moreover, each comes in three versions: human-readable for nonlawyers, lawyer-readable for lawyers and judges, and machine-readable for search engines and other visiting software. They’re extremely convenient and their convenience has revolutionized libre OA.
The best way to refer to a specific flavor of libre OA is by referring to a specific open license. We’ll never have unambiguous, widely understood technical terms for every useful variation on the theme. But we already have clearly named licenses for all the major variations on the theme, and we can add new ones for more subtle variations any time we want.
A work without an open license stands or appears to stand under an all-rights-reserved copyright. If the rights holder privately welcomes uses beyond fair use, or has decided not to sue for certain kinds of infringement, ordinary users have no way to know that and are forced to choose the least of three evils: the delay of asking permission, the risk of proceeding without it, and the harm of erring on the side of nonuse. These are not only obstacles to research; they are obstacles that libre OA was designed to remove.
The BBB definition calls for both gratis and libre OA. However, most of the notable OA success stories are gratis and not libre. I mean this in two senses: gratis success stories are more numerous than libre success stories, so far, and most gratis success stories are notable. Even if they stop short of libre OA, they are hard-won victories and major advances.
Some observers look at the prominent gratis OA success stories and conclude that the OA movement focuses on gratis OA and neglects libre. Others look at the public definitions and conclude that OA focuses on libre OA and disparages gratis. Both assessments are one-sided and unfair.
One hard fact is that gratis OA is often attainable in circumstances when libre OA is not attainable. For example, a major victory of the OA movement has been to persuade the majority of toll-access publishers and toll-access journals to allow green gratis OA. We’re very far from the same position for green libre OA. Similarly, most of the strong OA policies at funding agencies and universities require green gratis OA. A few require green libre OA, and green libre OA is growing for other reasons. But if these funders and universities had waited until they could muster the votes for a green libre policy, most of them would still be waiting. (See section 4.3 on the historical timing of OA policies.)
A second hard fact is that even gratis OA policies can face serious political obstacles. They may be easier to adopt than libre policies, but in most cases they’re far from easy. The OA policy at the U.S. National Institutes of Health was first proposed by Congress in 2004, adopted as a mere request or encouragement in 2005, and strengthened into a requirement in 2008. Every step along the way was strenuously opposed by an aggressive and well-funded publishing lobby. Yet even now the policy provides only gratis OA, not libre OA. Similarly, the gratis OA policies at funders and universities were only adopted after years of patiently educating decision-makers and answering their objections and misunderstandings. Reaching the point of adoption, and especially unanimous votes for adoption, is a cause for celebration, even if the policies only provide gratis, not libre OA.
The Directory of Open Access Journals is the most authoritative catalog of OA journals and the only one limiting itself to peer-reviewed journals. But only 20 percent of titles in the DOAJ use CC licenses, and fewer than 11 percent use the recommended CC-BY license. Viewed the other way around, about 80 percent of peer-reviewed OA journals don’t use any kind of CC license. Some of these might use non-CC licenses with a similar legal effect, but these exceptions are rare. Simply put, most OA journals are not using open licenses. Most operate under all-rights-reserved copyrights and leave their users with no more freedom than they already had under fair use. Most are not offering libre OA. Even those wanting to block commercial use, for example, tend to use an all-rights-reserved copyright rather than an open license that blocks commercial use, such as CC-BY-NC, but allows libre OA in other respects.
I’ve argued that it’s unfair to criticize the OA movement for disparaging gratis OA (merely on the ground that its public statements call for libre) or neglecting libre OA (merely on the ground that most of its success stories are gratis). But two related criticisms would be more just. First, demanding libre or nothing where libre is currently unattainable makes the perfect the enemy of the good. Fortunately, this tactical mistake is rare. Second, settling for gratis where libre is attainable makes the good a substitute for the better. Unfortunately, this tactical mistake is common, as we see from the majority of OA journals that stop at gratis when they could easily offer libre.
Let’s be more specific about the desirability of libre OA. Why should we bother, especially when we may already have attained gratis OA? The answer is that we need libre OA to spare users the delay and expense of seeking permission whenever they want to exceed fair use. And there are good scholarly reasons to exceed fair use. For example:
to quote long excerpts
• to distribute full-text copies to students or colleagues
• to burn copies on CDs for bandwidth-poor parts of the world
• to distribute semantically-tagged or otherwise enhanced (i.e., modified) versions
• to migrate texts to new formats or media to keep them readable as technologies change
• to create and archive copies for long-term preservation
• to include works in a database or mashup
• to make an audio recording of a text
• to translate a text into another language
• to copy a text for indexing, text-mining, or other kinds of processing
In some jurisdictions, some of these uses may actually fall under fair use, even if most do not. Courts have settled some of the boundaries of fair use but by no means all of them, and in any case users can’t be expected to know all the relevant court rulings. Uncertainty about these boundaries, and increasingly severe penalties for copyright infringement, make users fear liability and act cautiously. It makes them decide that they can’t use something they’d like to use, or that they must delay their research in order to seek permission.
Libre OA under open licenses solves all these problems. Even when a desirable use is already allowed by fair use, a clear open license removes all doubt. When a desirable use does exceed fair use, a clear open license removes the restriction and offers libre OA.
When you can offer libre OA, don’t leave users with no more freedom than fair use. Don’t leave them uncertain about what they may and may not do. Don’t make conscientious users choose between the delay of seeking permission and the risk of proceeding without it. Don’t increase the pressure to make users less conscientious. Don’t make them pay for permission. Don’t make them err on the side of nonuse. Make your work as usable and useful as it can possibly be.

                         The Supreme Court probably will overturn the notorious Communications Decency Act. But the issues are not as cut-and-dried as some might suggest.              

                         By Eugene Volokh              

                         (1,777 words; posted Thursday, July 18; to be composted Thursday, July 25)              

         One of the great recurring problems in free-speech law is spillover. Free speech, the Supreme Court has held, has limits: Some speech is so harmful and so lacking in redeeming value that it may be restricted. Threats, blackmail, and false advertising are obvious examples. There's no right to say, ""Your money or your life"" to a stranger in a dark alley; there's no right to spread intentional falsehoods about your product or your enemy's character. 

         The Supreme Court likewise has held, rightly or wrongly, that minors have no right to see very sexually explicit material, and that people (except, perhaps, the minors' parents) have no right to distribute such material to them. Psychologists and philosophers can debate this, but as a constitutional matter, the question is settled. 

         But it's often impossible to keep such materials from children without also denying them to adults. Bookstores can check customers' ages, but TV broadcasters, muralists, or people who post things on the Internet can't. The law can allow public display of this material, protecting adults' access but also making it available to children; or the law can prohibit public display, insulating children but also restricting adults. Either way there's spillover. Either the restriction spills over onto speech that should be free, or the freedom spills over onto speech that, in the judgment of most legislators, voters, and judges, should be restricted. 

         This spillover problem is a recurring question in First Amendment law. The law cannot restrict all harmful, valueless speech and at the same time protect all valuable speech. A classic illustration of the spillover problem is the Communications Decency Act, passed earlier this year in an attempt to stop ""indecency"" on the Internet. A three-judge federal court was probably correct in striking down the CDA June 11. But the judges' opinions don't squarely face the spillover problem. Perhaps--contrary to the suggestions of some Supreme Court cases--spillover questions should always be resolved in favor of free speech. Perhaps children's increased vulnerability is a price worth paying for extra freedom for adults. But it's important to confront honestly both what's being lost and gained in the process. 

         The most controversial part of the CDA prohibits anyone from 

         ""us[ing] an interactive computer service"" 

         ""to display in a manner available to a person under 18 years of age"" 

         ""any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication"" 

         ""that, in context, depicts or describes,"" 

         ""in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards,"" 

         ""sexual or excretory activities or organs."" 

         Virtually any sort of speech in the public areas of cyberspace is available to minors, so the law really applies to all such areas, including Web sites, Internet newsgroups, e-mail discussion lists, chat rooms, and bulletin boards. 

         And ""patently offensive"" can cover a lot of territory. Many profanities might be considered ""patently offensive"" descriptions of ""sexual or excretory activities or organs,"" especially under the standards of some conservative communities. Putting a David Mamet play on your Web site, thus, might be a crime. The term ""patently offensive"" is vague enough that no one knows for sure, but the wise user will take a conservative approach. Given some recent Supreme Court decisions, it seems unlikely that the vagueness alone would make the act unconstitutional. But there's no doubt that the law's vagueness does indeed make it more likely to stifle someone's freedom of expression. 

         The CDA, though ostensibly intended to protect children, clearly has a spillover effect on adults. Adults generally have the right to see material that's ""patently offensive."" There are two exceptions to this: child pornography (sexually explicit pictures made using child models) and ""obscenity""--but both are much smaller categories than the CDA's ""indecency."" May the government, in its quest to shield children, restrict the online choices of grownups? Or to look at it the other way: Must the courts, in order to protect the freedom of grownups, restrict the government's ability to shield children? 

         The Supreme Court precedents are unclear. In a 1957 case called Butler vs. Michigan , a state law barred distribution of material that might be unsuitable for minors. The court concluded that such a ban was unconstitutional. The law, it said, ""reduce[d] the adult population of Michigan to reading only what is fit for children. ... Surely, this is to burn the house to roast the pig."" The court agreed that the state could bar distribution of such stuff directly to children. But clearly, such limited restrictions don't work as well as a total ban. The court apparently was willing to tolerate some perceived harm to children in order to protect the freedom of adults. 

         But in some recent cases, the court has taken a different approach. One such case is the oft-criticized FCC vs. Pacifica Foundation (1978). The Pacifica court upheld a ban on ""indecency""--George Carlin's ""Seven Dirty Words"" monologue--on radio and television broadcasts ""when there is a reasonable risk that children may be in the audience."" The spillover was clear: Adults were deprived of access to certain materials on certain media (radio and television) during most hours. But the justices were willing to allow such a restriction of adults' access to speech in order to shield children. 

          

            Pacifica is a narrow decision, and there's language in it suggesting that it only applies to over-the-air broadcasting. But in this year's cable indecency case, known as Denver Consortium , four Supreme Court justices were willing to use Pacifica as a guide for cable television as well as over-the-air broadcasting. (The CDA court's decision was written before Denver Consortium was handed down.) And during the last 10 years, some lower courts have upheld bans on public display of sexually explicit material that's not technically ""obscene"" on the grounds that the law may shield children even if this keeps, say, a would-be muralist from communicating to adults. The Supreme Court hasn't spoken on these specific statutes. 

         Another important, though somewhat ambiguous, precedent is Sable Communications vs. FCC (1990), in which the court struck down a ban on dial-a-porn. The government argued the ban was needed to protect children. But the court pointed out that there might be ""less restrictive alternatives"" that would insulate children without entirely banning the medium. For example, the court said, the government could require services to take credit-card numbers, or require phone companies to let parents block area-code-900 phone calls. 

         Still, the court was willing to tolerate some spillover; after all, even the alternatives it suggested would deny access to some adults. And it also hinted that it might even allow a total ban if such alternatives could be shown to be inadequate. Denver Consortium followed the same pattern: It struck down a restriction on indecent speech because there were other effective alternatives available; but it suggested that such a restriction might be constitutional if it were, in fact, the only effective way to shield children. 

          

            Sable and Denver Consortium make clear that the court won't tolerate unnecessary spillover onto adults. But on the tough question--what happens if it's impossible to shield minors without burdening adults?--there's an unresolved tension. Butler says that the speech must be allowed. Pacifica , Sable , and now Denver Consortium suggest that the speech may be restricted. 

         On the Internet, is it possible to shield children without restricting adults? Parents can get software--SurfWatch is one popular brand--that keeps their computers from accessing any place that's on a list of ""dirty"" locations, a list selected and frequently updated by the software designers. If the government wanted to, it could buy SurfWatch (for a fraction of what it would cost to enforce the CDA) and give it away to parents. Could this be the ""less restrictive alternative"" that the government could use instead of CDA's total ban? Well, it depends on how much shielding of children you're willing to sacrifice. The SurfWatch solution is limited by the software designers' ability to keep up with the latest ""dirty"" places. Dozens of Web sites are being added daily, and you never know what will get posted tomorrow even on existing sites or newsgroups. Some things will inevitably be missed. 

         The purely technological fix, then, is less restrictive than the CDA, but it's also less effective. The CDA, of course, won't be perfect, either--many will flout it, and Web sites in other countries won't be bound by it--but the ban plus the technological fix probably will shield children better than the technological fix alone. Does this extra protection justify the considerable spillover? The precedents don't answer this. 

         There's a hybrid technological and legal approach that might be more effective, and thus more likely to be the sort of ""less restrictive alternative"" that would make the total ban invalid. The law might demand that online material be rated--that any sufficiently sexually explicit text or image be marked ""dirty"" in a way that computers can easily recognize. Parents could then set up their children's computers to block access to these pages. Alternatively, the software could assume that any page is dirty unless it's labeled ""clean,"" with the law making it illegal to falsely mark ""clean"" a page that's actually dirty. 

         Many people, of course, might misrate their material--intentionally or accidentally. But the CDA will be intentionally or accidentally violated, too. In fact, a rating requirement might be more effective than a total ban. People may be more willing to comply with the rating law, since it would let them continue selling their wares or expressing their views. Still, ratings won't shield children using computers that don't have the rating software turned on. And no one knows how often this will happen. 

         The CDA is now in the hands of the Supreme Court. Some say the justices should simply rule that sexually explicit material isn't as dangerous for children as it's cracked up to be, and therefore, free speech should prevail. But many people, probably including the justices, are willing to accept that sexually explicit material is indeed harmful to children. Other CDA critics assert that the technological alternatives will shield children every bit as well as a total ban would, and that the CDA therefore is entirely unnecessary. But that too will be hard to prove. 

         Ultimately, then, the justices will have to make a hard choice: sacrifice some shielding of children in order to protect the freedom of grownups, or sacrifice some access by grownups in order to shield children. My guess is that the marginal benefit of the CDA over the technological alternatives is small enough, and the burden that the law creates is large enough, that the CDA will be overturned. But it's a closer question than many might think.

DANGER! THRILLS! ADVENTURE!


 Alan Green was not exactly a hero. In fact he liked peace just as
 well as the next man. Not that he was really afraid of that crazy,
 hot-blooded hound-dog Alzo, or even of the hound's gorgeous owner, the
 Duchess Zuni—who was also hot-blooded (to say nothing of the Duke).
 After all, these things were understood on this backward, violent
 planet, and a man could manage, provided he was alert twenty-four hours
 a day.


 And as a matter of fact, Alan was only normally apprehensive of his
 Junoesque, tempestuous (but altogether lovable) wife Amra. Delightful,
 demanding Amra—and her five uproarious kids. The trouble was, he was
 tired. And homesick.


 So when he heard of two other downed spacemen, he hitched a ride with
 a piratical merchant-captain on a windroller destined to carry him to
 the spaceship and thence to the peaceful green hills of Earth. But
 he had reckoned without the vagaries of the windroller, pirates, the
 ""traveling islands,"" the rascally Captain, and various flora and fauna
 peculiar to this planet—all of which, it now seemed, regarded Alan
 with unnerving malevolence.


 And worst of all, Amra was determined that he should be a hero. Amra
 won.
1
For two years Alan Green had lived without hope. From the day the
 spaceship had crashed on this unknown planet he had resigned himself
 to the destiny created for him by accident and mathematics. Chances
 against another ship landing within the next hundred years were a
 million to one. Therefore it would do no good to sit around waiting
 for rescue. Much as he loathed the idea, he must live the rest of his
 life here, and he must squeeze as much blood as he could out of this
 planet-sized turnip. There wasn't much to squeeze. In fact, it seemed
 to him that he was the one losing the blood. Shortly after he'd been
 cast away he'd been made a slave.


 Now, suddenly, he had hope.


 Hope came to him a month after he'd been made foreman of the kitchen
 slaves of the Duke of Tropat. It came to him as he was standing behind
 the Duchess during a meal and directing those who were waiting upon her.


 It was the Duchess Zuni who had not so subtly maneuvered him from the
 labor pens to his coveted, if dangerous, position. Why dangerous?
 Because she was very jealous and possessive, and the slightest hint of
 lack of attention from him could mean he'd lose his life or one limb
 or another. The knowledge of what had happened to his two predecessors
 kept him extremely sensitive to her every gesture, her every wish.


 That fateful morning he was standing behind her as she sat at one end
 of the long breakfast table. In one hand he held his foreman's wand,
 a little white baton topped by a large red ball. With it he gestured
 at the slaves who served food, who poured wine and beer, who fanned
 away the flies, who carried in the household god and sat it on the god
 chair, who played something like music. Now and then he bent over the
 Duchess Zuni's long black hair and whispered phrases from this or that
 love poem, praising her beauty, her supposed unattainability, and his
 burning, if seemingly hopeless, passion for her. Zuni would smile, or
 repeat the formula of thanks—the short one—or else giggle at his
 funny accent.


 The Duke sat at the other end of the table. He ignored the by-play,
 just as he ignored the so-called secret passage inside the walls of the
 castle, which Green used to get to the Duchess's apartments. Custom
 demanded this, just as custom demanded that he should play the outraged
 husband if she got tired of Green or angry at him and accused him
 publicly of amorous advances. This was enough to make Green jittery,
 but he had more than the Duke to consider. There was Alzo.


 Alzo was the Duchess's watchdog, a mastiff-like monster with shaggy
 red-gold hair. The dog hated Green with a vindictiveness that Green
 could only account for by supposing that the animal knew, perhaps from
 his body-odor, that he was not a native of this planet. Alzo rumbled
 a warning deep in his chest every time Green bent over the Duchess or
 made a too-sudden movement. Occasionally he rose to his four feet and
 nuzzled the man's leg. When that happened Green could not keep from
 breaking out into a sweat, for the dog had twice bitten him, playfully,
 so to speak, and severely lacerated his calf. As if that weren't bad
 enough, Green had to worry that the natives might notice that his scars
 healed abnormally fast, almost overnight. He'd been forced to wear
 bandages on his legs long after the new skin had come in.


 Even now, the nauseating canine was sniffing around Green's quivering
 hide in the hope of putting the fear of the devil in him. At that
 moment the Earthman resolved that, come the headsman's ax, rack, wheel,
 or other hellish tortures, he was going to kill that hound. It was just
 after he made that vow that the Duchess caused him to forget altogether
 the beast.


 ""Dear,"" said Zuni, interrupting the Duke in the midst of his
 conversation with a merchant-captain, ""what is this I hear about two
 men who have fallen from the sky in a great ship of iron?""


 Green quivered, and he held his breath as he waited for the Duke's
 reply.


 The Duke, a short, dark many-chinned man with white hair and very thick
 bristly salt-and-pepper eyebrows, frowned.


 ""Men? Demons, rather! Can men fly in an iron ship through the air?
 These two claimed to have come from the stars, and you know what that
 means. Remember Oixrotl's prophecy:
A demon will come, claiming
 to be an angel
. No doubt about these two! Just to show you their
 subtlety, they claim to be neither demon nor angels, but men! Now,
 there's devilish clever thinking. Confusing to anybody but the most
 clear-headed. I'm glad the King of Estorya wasn't taken in.""


 Eagerly Zuni leaned forward, her large brown eyes bright, and her
 red-painted mouth open and wet. ""Oh, has he burned them already? What a
 shame! I should think he'd at least torture them for a while.""


 Miran, the merchant-captain, said, ""Your pardon, gracious lady, but the
 King of Estorya has done no such thing. The Estoryan law demands that
 all suspected demons should be kept in prison for two years. Everybody
 knows that a devil can't keep his human disguise more than two years.
 At the end of that time he reverts to his natural flesh and form, a
 hideous sight to behold, blasphemous, repulsive, soul-shaking.""


 Miran rolled his one good eye so that only the white showed and made
 the sign to ward off evil, the index finger held rigidly out from a
 clenched fist. Jugkaxtr, the household priest, dived under the table,
 where he crouched praying, secure in the knowledge that demons couldn't
 touch him while he knelt beneath the thrice-blessed wood. The Duke
 swallowed a whole glass of wine, apparently to calm his nerves, and
 belched.


 Miran wiped his face and said, ""Of course, I wasn't able to find
 out much, because we merchants are regarded with deep suspicion and
 scarcely dare to move outside the harbor or the marketplace. The
 Estoryans worship a female deity—ridiculous, isn't it?—and eat fish.
 They hate us Tropatians because we worship Zaxropatr, Male of Males,
 and because they must depend on us to bring them fish. But they aren't
 close-mouthed. They babble on and on to us, especially when one has
 given them wine for nothing.""


 Green finally released his breath in a sigh of relief. How glad he
 was that he had never told these people his true origin! So far as
 they knew he was merely one of the many slaves who came from a distant
 country in the North.


 Miran cleared his throat, adjusted his violet turban and yellow robes,
 pulled gently at the large gold ring that hung from his nose and said,
 ""It took me a month to get back from Estorya, and that is very good
 time indeed, but then I am noted for my good luck, though I prefer to
 call it skill plus the favor given by the gods to the truly devout.
 I do not boast, O gods, but merely give you tribute because you have
 smiled upon my ventures and have found pleasing the scent of my many
 sacrifices in your nostrils!""


 Green lowered his eyelids to conceal the expression of disgust which he
 felt must be shining from them. At the same time, he saw Zuni's shoe
 tapping impatiently. Inwardly he groaned, because he knew she would
 divert the conversation to something more interesting to her, to her
 clothes and the state of her stomach and/or complexion. And there would
 be nothing that anybody could do about it, because the custom was that
 the woman of the house regulated the subject of talk during breakfast.
 If only this had been lunch or dinner! Then the men would theoretically
 have had uncontested control.


 ""These two demons were very tall, like your slave Green, here,"" said
 Miran, ""and they could not speak a word of Estoryan. Or at least they
 claimed they couldn't. When King Raussmig's soldiers tried to capture
 them they brought from the folds of their strange clothes two pistols
 that only had to be pointed to send silent and awesome and sure death.
 Everywhere men dropped dead. Panic overtook many, but there were brave
 soldiers who kept on charging, and eventually the magical instruments
 became exhausted. The demons were overpowered and put into the Tower
 of Grass Cats from which no man or demon has yet escaped. And there
 they will be until the Festival of the Sun's Eye. Then they will be
 burnt....""


 From beneath the table rose the babble of the priest, Jugkaxtr,
 as he blessed everyone in the house, down to the latest-born pup,
 and the fleas living thereoff, and cursed all those who were
 possessed by even the tiniest demon. The Duke, growing impatient at
 the noise, kicked under the table. Jugkaxtr yelped and presently
 crawled out. He sat down and began gnawing the meat from a bone,
 a well-done-thou-good-and-faithful-servant expression on his fat
 features. Green also felt like kicking him, just as he often felt
 like kicking every single human being on this planet. It was hard to
 remember that he must exercise compassion and understanding for them,
 and that his own remote ancestors had once been just as nauseatingly
 superstitious, cruel and bloody.


 There was a big difference between reading about such people and
 actually living among them. A history or a romantic novel could
 describe how unwashed and diseased and formula-bound primitives were,
 but only the too-too substantial stench and filth could make your gorge
 rise.


 Even as he stood there Zuni's powerful perfume rose and clung in heavy
 festoons about him and slithered down his nostrils. It was a rare and
 expensive perfume, brought back by Miran from his voyages and given to
 her as a token of the merchant's esteem. Used in small quantities it
 would have been quite effective to express feminine daintiness and to
 hint at delicate passion. But no, Zuni poured it like water over her,
 hoping to cover up the stale odor left by
not
taking a bath more than
 once a month.


 She looked so beautiful, he thought. And stank so terribly. At least
 she had at first. Now she looked less beautiful because he knew how
 stupid she was, and didn't stink quite so badly because his nostrils
 had become somewhat adjusted. They'd had to.


 ""I intend to be back in Estorya by the time of the festival,"" said
 Miran. ""I've never seen the Eye of the Sun burn demons before. It's a
 giant lens, you know. There will be just time enough to make a voyage
 there and get back before the rainy season. I expect to make even
 greater profits than the last time, because I've established some
 highly placed contacts. O gods, I do not boast but merely praise your
 favor to your humble worshiper, Miran the Merchant of the Clan of
 Effenycan!""


 ""Please bring me some more of this perfume,"" said the Duchess, ""and I
 just love the diamond necklace you gave me.""


 ""Diamonds, emeralds, rubies!"" cried Miran, kissing his hand and rolling
 his eye ecstatically. ""I tell you, the Estoryans are rich beyond our
 dreams! Jewels flow in their marketplaces like drops of water in a
 cataract! Ah, if only the Emperor could be induced to organize a great
 raiding fleet and storm its walls!""


 ""He remembers too well what happened to his father's fleet when he
 tried it,"" growled the Duke. ""The storm that destroyed his thirty ships
 was undoubtedly raised by the priests of the Goddess Hooda. I still
 think that the expedition would have succeeded, however, if the late
 Emperor had not ignored the vision that came to him the night before
 they set sail. It was the great god Axoputqui, and he said....""


 There was a lengthy conversation which did not hold Green's attention.
 He was too busy trying to think of a plan whereby he could get
 to Estorya and to the demons' iron vessel, which was obviously a
 spaceship. This was his only chance. Soon the rainy season would start
 and there would be no vessels leaving for at least three months.


 He could, of course, just walk away and hope to get to Estorya on foot.
 Thousands of miles through countless perils, and he had only a general
 idea of where the city was ... no, Miran was his only hope.


 But how...? He didn't think that stowing away would work. There was
 always a careful search for slaves who might try just that very plan.
 He looked at Miran, the short, fat, big-stomached, hook-nosed, one-eyed
 fellow with many chins and a large gold ring in his nose. The fellow
 was shrewd, shrewd, and he would not want to offend the Duchess by
 helping her official gigolo escape. Not, that is, unless Green could
 offer him something that was so valuable that he couldn't afford not to
 take the risk. Miran boasted that he was a hard-headed businessman, but
 it was Green's observation that there was always a large soft spot in
 that supposedly impenetrable cranium: the Fissure of Cupiditas.
2
The Duke rose, and everybody followed his example. Jugkaxtr chanted the
 formula of dismissal, then sat down to finish gnawing on the bone. The
 others filed out. Green walked in front of Zuni in order to warn her
 of any obstacles in her path and to take the brunt of any attempted
 assassination. As he did so he was seized by the ankle and tripped
 headlong. He did not fall hard because he was a quick man, in spite
 of his six-foot-two and hundred ninety pounds. But he rose red-faced
 because of the loud laughter and from repressed anger at Alzo, who had
 again repeated his trick of grabbing Green's leg and upsetting him.
 He wanted to grab a spear from a nearby guard and spit Alzo. But that
 would be the end of Green. And whereas up to now there had been many
 times when he would not particularly have cared if he left this planet
 via the death route, he could not now make a false move. Not when
 escape was so near!


 So he grinned sheepishly and again preceded the Duchess, while the
 others followed her out. When they reached the bottom of the broad
 stone staircase that led to the upper floors of the castle, Zuni told
 Green that he was to go to the marketplace and buy tomorrow's food. As
 for her, she was going back to bed and sleep until noon.


 Inwardly Green groaned. How long could he keep up this pace? He was
 expected to stay up half the night with her, then attend to his
 official duties during the day. She slept enough to be refreshed by
 the time he visited her, but he never had a chance for any real rest.
 Even when he had his free hours in the afternoon he had to go to his
 house in the pens, and there he had to stay awake and attend to all
 his familial duties. And Amra, his slave-wife, and her six children
 demanded much from him. They were even more tyrannical than the
 Duchess, if that were possible.


 How long, O Lord, how long? The situation was intolerable; even if he'd
 not heard of the spaceship he would have plotted to escape. Better a
 quick death while trying to get away than a slow, torturous one by
 exhaustion.


 He bowed good-by to the Duke and Duchess, then followed the violet
 turban and yellow robes of Miran through the courtyard, through the
 thick stone walls, over the bridge of the broad moat, and into the
 narrow winding streets of the city of Quotz. Here the merchant-captain
 got into his silver-and-jewel-decorated rickshaw. The two long-legged
 men between its shafts, sailors and clansmen from Miran's vessel, the
Bird of Fortune
, began running through the crowd. The people made way
 for them, as two other sailors preceded them calling out Miran's name
 and cracking whips in the air.


 Green, after looking to make certain that nobody from the castle was
 around to see him, ran until he was even with the rickshaw. Miran
 halted it and asked what he wanted.


 ""Your pardon, Your Richness, but may a humble slave speak and not be
 reprimanded?""


 ""I presume it is no idle thought you have in mind,"" said Miran, looking
 Green over his one eye narrow in its fat-folds.


 ""It has to do with money.""


 ""Ah, despite your foreign accent you speak with a pleasing voice; you
 are the golden trumpet of Mennirox, my patron god. Speak!""


 ""First Your Richness must swear by Mennirox that you will under no
 circumstances divulge my proposal.""


 ""There is wealth in this? For me?""


 ""There is.""


 Miran glanced at his clansmen, standing there patiently, apparently
 oblivious of what was going on. He had power of life and death over
 them, but he didn't trust them. He said, ""Perhaps it would be better if
 I thought about this before making such a drastic oath. Could you meet
 me tonight at the Hour of the Wineglass at the House of Equality? And
 could you perhaps give me a slight hint of what you have in mind?""


 ""The answer to both is yes. My proposal has to do with the dried fish
 that you carry as cargo to the Estoryans. There is another thing, too,
 but I may not even hint at it until I have your oath.""


 ""Very well then. At the agreed hour. Fish, eh? I must be off. Time is
 money, you know. Get going boys, full sails.""


 Green hailed a passing rickshaw and seated himself comfortably in it.
 As assistant majordomo he had plenty of money. Moreover, the Duke and
 Duchess would have been outraged if he had lowered their prestige by
 walking through the city's streets. His vehicle made good time, too,
 because everybody recognized his livery: the scarlet and white tricorn
 hat and the white sleeveless shirt with the Duke's heraldic arms on its
 chest—red and green concentric circles pierced by a black arrow.


 The street led always downward, for the city had been built on the
 foothills of the mountains. It wandered here and there and gave Green
 plenty of time to think.


 The trouble was, he thought, that if the two imprisoned men at Estorya
 were to die before he got to them he'd still be lost. He had no idea
 of how to pilot or navigate a spaceship. He'd been a passenger on a
 freighter when it had unaccountably blown up, and he'd been forced to
 leave the dying vessel in one of those automatic castaway emergency
 shells. The capsule had got him down to the surface of this planet and
 was, as far as he knew, still up in the hills where he'd left it. After
 wandering for a week and almost starving to death he'd been picked up
 by some peasants. They had turned him in to the soldiers of a nearby
 garrison, thinking he must be a runaway slave on whom they'd collect
 a reward. Taken to the capital city of Quotz, Green had almost been
 freed because there was no record of his being anybody's property. But
 his tallness, blondness and inability to speak the local language had
 convinced his captors that he must have wandered down from some far
 northern country. Therefore if he wasn't a slave he should be.


 Presto, changeo! He was. And he'd put in six months in a quarry and a
 year as a dock worker. Then the Duchess had chanced to see him on the
 streets as she rode by, and he'd been transferred to the castle.


 The streets were alive with the short, dark, stocky natives and the
 taller, lighter-complexioned slaves. The former wore their turbans of
 various colors, indicating their status and trade. The latter wore
 their three-cornered hats. Occasionally a priest in his high conical
 hat, hexagonal spectacles and goatee rode by. Wagons and rickshaws
 drawn by men or by big, powerful dogs went by. Merchants stood at the
 fronts of their shops and hawked their wares in loud voices. They sold
 cloth, grixtr nut, parchment, knives, swords, helmets, drugs, books—on
 magic, on religion, on travel—spices, perfumes, ink, rugs, highly
 sugared drinks, wine, beer, tonic, paintings, everything that went to
 make up their civilization. Butchers stood before open shops where
 dressed fowl, deer and dogs hung. Dealers in birds pointed out the
 virtues of their many-colored and multi-songed pets.


 For the thousandth time Green wondered at this strange planet where
 the only large animals were men, dogs, grass cats, a small deer and
 a very small equine. In fact, there was a paucity of any variety of
 animal life, except for the surprisingly large number of birds. It was
 this scarcity of horses and oxen, he supposed, that helped perpetuate
 slavery. Man and dog had to provide most of the labor.


 No doubt there was an explanation for all this, but it must be buried
 so deep in this people's forgotten history that one would never know.
 Green, always curious, wished that he had time and means to explore.
 But he didn't. He might as well resign himself to keeping a whole skin
 and to getting out of this mess as fast as he could.


 There was enough to do merely to make his way through the narrow and
 crowded streets. He had to display his baton often to clear a path,
 though when he approached the harbor area he had less trouble because
 the streets were much wider.


 Here great wagons drawn by gangs of slaves carried huge loads to or
 from the ships. The thoroughfares had to be broad, else the people
 would have been crushed between wagon and house. Here also were the
 so-called Pens, where the dock-slaves lived. Once the area had actually
 been an enclosure where men and women were locked up for the night. But
 the walls had been torn down and new houses built in the old Duke's
 time. The closest Earthly parallel Green could think of for these
 edifices was a housing project. Small cottages, all exactly alike, set
 in military columns.


 For a moment he considered stopping off to see Amra, then decided
 against it. She'd get him tied up in an argument or something, and
 he'd spend too much time trying to soothe her, time that should be
 spent at the marketplace. He hated scenes, whereas Amra was a born
 self-dramatist who reveled in them, almost wallowed, one might say.


 He averted his eyes from the Pens and looked at the other side of
 the street, where the walls of the great warehouses towered. Workmen
 swarmed around them, and cranes, operated by gangs pushing wheels like
 a ship's capstan, raised or lowered big bundles. Here, he thought, was
 a business opportunity for him.


 Introduce the steam engine. It'd be the greatest thing that ever hit
 this planet. Wood-burning automobiles could replace the rickshaws.
 Cranes could be run by donkey-engines. The ships themselves could have
 their wheels powered by steam. Or perhaps, he thought, rails could be
 laid across the Xurdimur, and locomotives would make the ships obsolete.


 No, that wouldn't work. Iron rails cost too much. And the savages that
 roved over the grassy plains would tear them up and forge weapons from
 them.


 Besides, every time he suggested to the Duke a new and much more
 efficient method of doing something he ran dead into the brick wall of
 tradition and custom. Nothing new could be accepted unless the gods
 accepted it. The gods' will was interpreted by the priests. The priests
 clutched the status quo as tightly as a hungry infant clutches its
 mother's breast or an old man clings to his property.


 Green could make a fight against the theocracy, but he didn't feel it
 was worth while to become a martyr.


 He heard a familiar voice behind him calling his name.


 ""Alan! Alan!""


 He hunched his shoulders like a turtle withdrawing his head and thought
 desperately for a moment of trying to ignore the voice. But, though a
 woman's, it was powerful and penetrating, and everybody around him had
 already turned to see its owner. So he couldn't pretend he hadn't heard
 it.


 ""ALAN, YOU BIG BLOND NO-GOOD HUNK OF MAN, STOP!""


 Reluctantly Green told his rickshaw boy to turn around. The boy,
 grinning, did so. Like everybody else along the harbor front he knew
 Amra and was familiar with her relations with Green. She held their
 one-year-old daughter in her arms, cradled against her magnificent
 bosom. Behind her stood her other five children, her two sons by the
 Duke, her daughter by a visiting prince, her son by the captain of a
 Northerner ship, her daughter by a temple sculptor. Her rise and fall
 and slow rise again was told in the children around her; the tableau
 embodied an outline of the structure of the planet's society.
3
Her mother had been a Northerner slave; her father, a native freeman,
 a wheelwright. When she was five years old they had died in a plague.
 She had been transferred to the Pens and raised by her aunt. When she
 was fifteen her beauty had attracted the Duke and he had installed
 her in the palace. There she gave birth to his two sons, now ten and
 eleven, who would soon be taken away from her and raised in the Duke's
 household as free and petted servants.


 The Duke had married the present Duchess several years after his
 liaison with Amra began and her jealousy had forced him to get rid of
 Amra. Back to the Pens she had gone; perhaps the Duke had not been
 too sad to see her go, for living with her was like living with a
 hurricane, and he liked peace and quiet too well.


 Then, in accordance with the custom, she had been recommended by the
 Duke to a visiting prince; the prince had overstayed his leave from
 his native country because he hated to part with her, and the Duke had
 wanted to give her as a present. But here he'd overstepped his legal
 authority. Slaves had certain rights. A woman who had borne a citizen a
 child could not be shipped away or sold unless she gave her permission.
 Amra didn't choose to go, so the sorrowing prince had gone home, though
 not without leaving a memento of his visit behind him.


 The captain of a ship had purchased her, but here again the law came
 to her rescue. He could not take her out of the country, and she again
 refused to leave. By now she had purchased several businesses—slaves
 were allowed to hold property and even have slaves of their own—and
 she knew that her two boys by the Duke would be valuable later on, when
 they'd go to live with him.


 The temple sculptor had used her as his model for his great marble
 statue of the goddess of Fertility. Well he might, for she was a
 magnificent creature, a tall woman with long, richly auburn hair, a
 flawless skin, large russet brown eyes, a mouth as red and ripe as a
 plum, breasts with which neither child nor lover could find fault, a
 waist amazingly slender considering the rest of her curved body and her
 fruitfulness. Her long legs would have looked good on an Earthwoman and
 were even more outstanding among a population of club-ankled females.


 There was more to her than beauty. She radiated a something that struck
 every male at first sight; to Green she sometimes seemed to be a
 violent physical event, perhaps even a principle of Nature herself.


 There were times when Green felt proud because she had picked him as
 her mate, chosen him when he was a newly imported slave who could say
 only a few words in the highly irregular agglutinative tongue. But
 there were times when he felt that she was too much for him, and those
 times had been getting too frequent lately. Besides, he felt a pang
 whenever he saw their child, because he loved it and dreaded the moment
 when he would have to leave it. As for deserting Amra, he wasn't sure
 how that would make him feel. Undeniably, she did affect him, but then
 so did a blow in the teeth or wine in the blood.


 He got down out of the rickshaw, told the boy to wait, said, ""Hello,
 honey,"" and kissed her. He was glad she was a slave, because she didn't
 wear a nose-ring. When he kissed the Duchess he was always annoyed
 by hers. She refused to take it off when with him because that would
 put her on his level, and he mustn't ever forget he was a slave. It
 was perfectly moral for her to take a bondsman as a lover but not a
 freeman, and she was nothing if not moral.


 Amra's return kiss was passionate, part of which was the vigor of
 asperity. ""You're not fooling me,"" she said. ""You meant to ride right
 by. Kiss the children! What's the matter, are you getting tired of me?
 You told me you only accepted the Duchess's offer because it meant
 advancement, and you were afraid that if you turned her down she'd
 find an excuse to kill you. Well, I believed you—half-believed you,
 anyway. But I won't if you try sneaking by without seeing me. What's
 the matter? Are you a man or not? Are you afraid to face a woman? Don't
 shake your head. You're a liar! Don't forget to kiss Grizquetr; you
 know he's an affectionate boy and worships you, and it's absurd to
 say that in your country grown men don't kiss boys that old. You're
 not in your country—what a strange, frigid, loveless race must live
 there—and even if you were you might overlook their customs to show
 some tenderness to the boy. Come on back to our house and I'll bring up
 some of that wonderful Chalousma wine that came in the other day out of
 the cellar——""


 ""What was a ship doing in your cellar?"" he said, and he whooped with
 laughter. ""By all the gods, Amra, I know it's been two days since I've
 seen you, but don't try to crowd forty-eight hours' conversation into
 ten minutes, especially your kind of conversation. And quit scolding me
 in front of the children. You know it's bad for them. They might pick
 up your attitude of contempt for the head of the house.""


 ""I? Contempt? Why, I worship the ground you walk on! I tell them
 continually what a fine man you are, though it's rather hard to
 convince them when you do show up and they see the truth. Still....""

Meeting someone who's been dead for twenty
 
years is shocking enough for anyone with a
 
belief in ghosts—worse for one with none!
I


 The narrow cove was quiet as the face of an expectant child, yet so
 near the ruffled Atlantic that the last push of wind carried the
Annie
 O.
its full length. The man in gray flannels and sweatshirt let the
 sail come crumpling down and hurried past its white folds at a gait
 made comically awkward by his cramped muscles. Slowly the rocky ledge
 came nearer. Slowly the blue V inscribed on the cove's surface by the
 sloop's prow died. Sloop and ledge kissed so gently that he hardly had
 to reach out his hand.


 He scrambled ashore, dipping a sneaker in the icy water, and threw the
 line around a boulder. Unkinking himself, he looked back through the
 cove's high and rocky mouth at the gray-green scattering of islands
 and the faint dark line that was the coast of Maine. He almost laughed
 in satisfaction at having disregarded vague warnings and done the thing
 every man yearns to do once in his lifetime—gone to the farthest
 island out.


 He must have looked longer than he realized, because by the time he
 dropped his gaze the cove was again as glassy as if the
Annie O.
had
 always been there. And the splotches made by his sneaker on the rock
 had faded in the hot sun. There was something very unusual about the
 quietness of this place. As if time, elsewhere hurrying frantically,
 paused here to rest. As if all changes were erased on this one bit of
 Earth.


 The man's lean, melancholy face crinkled into a grin at the banal
 fancy. He turned his back on his new friend, the little green sloop,
 without one thought for his nets and specimen bottles, and set out to
 explore. The ground rose steeply at first and the oaks were close, but
 after a little way things went downhill and the leaves thinned and he
 came out on more rocks—and realized that he hadn't quite gone to the
 farthest one out.
Joined to this island by a rocky spine, which at the present low tide
 would have been dry but for the spray, was another green, high island
 that the first had masked from him all the while he had been sailing.
 He felt a thrill of discovery, just as he'd wondered back in the woods
 whether his might not be the first human feet to kick through the
 underbrush. After all, there were thousands of these islands.


 Then he was dropping down the rocks, his lanky limbs now moving
 smoothly enough.


 To the landward side of the spine, the water was fairly still. It even
 began with another deep cove, in which he glimpsed the spiny spheres
 of sea urchins. But from seaward the waves chopped in, sprinkling his
 trousers to the knees and making him wince pleasurably at the thought
 of what vast wings of spray and towers of solid water must crash up
 from here in a storm.


 He crossed the rocks at a trot, ran up a short grassy slope, raced
 through a fringe of trees—and came straight up against an eight-foot
 fence of heavy mesh topped with barbed wire and backed at a short
 distance with high, heavy shrubbery.


 Without pausing for surprise—in fact, in his holiday mood, using
 surprise as a goad—he jumped for the branch of an oak whose trunk
 touched the fence, scorning the easier lower branch on the other side
 of the tree. Then he drew himself up, worked his way to some higher
 branches that crossed the fence, and dropped down inside.


 Suddenly cautious, he gently parted the shrubbery and, before the first
 surprise could really sink in, had another.
A closely mown lawn dotted with more shrubbery ran up to a snug white
 Cape Cod cottage. The single strand of a radio aerial stretched the
 length of the roof. Parked on a neat gravel driveway that crossed just
 in front of the cottage was a short, square-lined touring car that he
 recognized from remembered pictures as an ancient Essex. The whole
 scene had about it the same odd quietness as the cove.


 Then, with the air of a clock-work toy coming to life, the white door
 opened and an elderly woman came out, dressed in a long, lace-edged
 dress and wide, lacy hat. She climbed into the driver's seat of the
 Essex, sitting there very stiff and tall. The motor began to chug
 bravely, gravel skittered, and the car rolled off between the trees.


 The door of the house opened again and a slim girl emerged. She wore a
 white silk dress that fell straight from square neck-line to hip-height
 waistline, making the skirt seem very short. Her dark hair was bound
 with a white bandeau so that it curved close to her cheeks. A dark
 necklace dangled against the white of the dress. A newspaper was tucked
 under her arm.


 She crossed the driveway and tossed the paper down on a rattan table
 between three rattan chairs and stood watching a squirrel zigzag across
 the lawn.
The man stepped through the wall of shrubbery, called, ""hello!"" and
 walked toward her.


 She whirled around and stared at him as still as if her heart had
 stopped beating. Then she darted behind the table and waited for him
 there. Granting the surprise of his appearance, her alarm seemed not
 so much excessive as eerie. As if, the man thought, he were not an
 ordinary stranger, but a visitor from another planet.


 Approaching closer, he saw that she was trembling and that her breath
 was coming in rapid, irregular gasps. Yet the slim, sweet, patrician
 face that stared into his had an underlying expression of expectancy
 that reminded him of the cove. She couldn't have been more than
 eighteen.


 He stopped short of the table. Before he could speak, she stammered
 out, ""Are you he?""


 ""What do you mean?"" he asked, smiling puzzledly.


 ""The one who sends me the little boxes.""


 ""I was out sailing and I happened to land in the far cove. I didn't
 dream that anyone lived on this island, or even came here.""


 ""No one ever does come here,"" she replied. Her manner had changed,
 becoming at once more wary and less agitated, though still eerily
 curious.


 ""It startled me tremendously to find this place,"" he blundered on.
 ""Especially the road and the car. Why, this island can't be more than a
 quarter of a mile wide.""


 ""The road goes down to the wharf,"" she explained, ""and up to the top of
 the island, where my aunts have a tree-house.""


 He tore his mind away from the picture of a woman dressed like Queen
 Mary clambering up a tree. ""Was that your aunt I saw driving off?""


 ""One of them. The other's taken the motorboat in for supplies."" She
 looked at him doubtfully. ""I'm not sure they'll like it if they find
 someone here.""


 ""There are just the three of you?"" he cut in quickly, looking down the
 empty road that vanished among the oaks.


 She nodded.


 ""I suppose you go in to the mainland with your aunts quite often?""


 She shook her head.


 ""It must get pretty dull for you.""


 ""Not very,"" she said, smiling. ""My aunts bring me the papers and other
 things. Even movies. We've got a projector. My favorite stars are
 Antonio Morino and Alice Terry. I like her better even than Clara Bow.""


 He looked at her hard for a moment. ""I suppose you read a lot?""


 She nodded. ""Fitzgerald's my favorite author."" She started around the
 table, hesitated, suddenly grew shy. ""Would you like some lemonade?""
He'd noticed the dewed silver pitcher, but only now realized his
 thirst. Yet when she handed him a glass, he held it untasted and said
 awkwardly, ""I haven't introduced myself. I'm Jack Barry.""


 She stared at his outstretched right hand, slowly extended her own
 toward it, shook it up and down exactly once, then quickly dropped it.


 He chuckled and gulped some lemonade. ""I'm a biology student. Been
 working at Wood's Hole the first part of the summer. But now I'm here
 to do research in marine ecology—that's sort of sea-life patterns—of
 the in-shore islands. Under the direction of Professor Kesserich. You
 know about him, of course?""


 She shook her head.


 ""Probably the greatest living biologist,"" he was proud to inform
 her. ""Human physiology as well. Tremendous geneticist. In a class
 with Carlson and Jacques Loeb. Martin Kesserich—he lives over there
 at town. I'm staying with him. You ought to have heard of him."" He
 grinned. ""Matter of fact, I'd never have met you if it hadn't been for
 Mrs. Kesserich.""


 The girl looked puzzled.


 Jack explained, ""The old boy's been off to Europe on some conferences,
 won't be back for a couple days more. But I was to get started anyhow.
 When I went out this morning Mrs. Kesserich—she's a drab sort of
 person—said to me, 'Don't try to sail to the farther islands.' So, of
 course, I had to. By the way, you still haven't told me your name.""


 ""Mary Alice Pope,"" she said, speaking slowly and with an odd wonder, as
 if she were saying it for the first time.


 ""You're pretty shy, aren't you?""


 ""How would I know?""


 The question stopped Jack. He couldn't think of anything to say to this
 strangely attractive girl dressed almost like a ""flapper.""


 ""Will you sit down?"" she asked him gravely.


 The rattan chair sighed under his weight. He made another effort to
 talk. ""I'll bet you'll be glad when summer's over.""


 ""Why?""


 ""So you'll be able to go back to the mainland.""


 ""But I never go to the mainland.""


 ""You mean you stay out here all winter?"" he asked incredulously, his
 mind filled with a vision of snow and frozen spray and great gray waves.


 ""Oh, yes. We get all our supplies on hand before winter. My aunts are
 very capable. They don't always wear long lace dresses. And now I help
 them.""


 ""But that's impossible!"" he said with sudden sympathetic anger. ""You
 can't be shut off this way from people your own age!""


 ""You're the first one I ever met."" She hesitated. ""I never saw a boy or
 a man before, except in movies.""


 ""You're joking!""


 ""No, it's true.""


 ""But why are they doing it to you?"" he demanded, leaning forward. ""Why
 are they inflicting this loneliness on you, Mary?""
She seemed to have gained poise from his loss of it. ""I don't know
 why. I'm to find out soon. But actually I'm not lonely. May I tell
 you a secret?"" She touched his hand, this time with only the faintest
 trembling. ""Every night the loneliness gathers in around me—you're
 right about that. But then every morning new life comes to me in a
 little box.""


 ""What's that?"" he said sharply.


 ""Sometimes there's a poem in the box, sometimes a book, or pictures,
 or flowers, or a ring, but always a note. Next to the notes I like the
 poems best. My favorite is the one by Matthew Arnold that ends,

'Ah, love, let us be true
To one another! for the world, which seems
To lie before us like a land of dreams,
So various, so beautiful, so new,
Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,
Nor certitude—'""

 ""Wait a minute,"" he interrupted. ""Who sends you these boxes?""


 ""I don't know.""


 ""But how are the notes signed?""


 ""They're wonderful notes,"" she said. ""So wise, so gay, so tender, you'd
 imagine them being written by John Barrymore or Lindbergh.""


 ""Yes, but how are they signed?""


 She hesitated. ""Never anything but 'Your Lover.'""


 ""And so when you first saw me, you thought—"" He began, then stopped
 because she was blushing.


 ""How long have you been getting them?""


 ""Ever since I can remember. I have two closets of the boxes. The new
 ones are either by my bed when I wake or at my place at breakfast.""


 ""But how does this—person get these boxes to you out here? Does he
 give them to your aunts and do they put them there?""


 ""I'm not sure.""


 ""But how can they get them in winter?""


 ""I don't know.""


 ""Look here,"" he said, pouring himself more lemonade, ""how long is it
 since you've been to the mainland?""


 ""Almost eighteen years. My aunts tell me I was born there in the middle
 of the war.""


 ""What war?"" he asked startledly, spilling some lemonade.


 ""The World War, of course. What's the matter?""


 Jack Barr was staring down at the spilled lemonade and feeling a kind
 of terror he'd never experienced in his waking life. Nothing around him
 had changed. He could still feel the same hot sun on his shoulders,
 the same icy glass in his hand, scent the same lemon-acid odor in his
 nostrils. He could still hear the faint
chop-chop
of the waves.


 And yet everything had changed, gone dark and dizzy as a landscape
 glimpsed just before a faint. All the little false notes had come to
 a sudden focus. For the lemonade had spilled on the headline of the
 newspaper the girl had tossed down, and the headline read:


 HITLER IN NEW DEFIANCE


 Under the big black banner of that head swam smaller ones:


 Foes of Machado Riot in Havana


 Big NRA Parade Planned


 Balbo Speaks in New York
Suddenly he felt a surge of relief. He had noticed that the paper was
 yellow and brittle-edged.


 ""Why are you so interested in old newspapers?"" he asked.


 ""I wouldn't call day-before-yesterday's paper old,"" the girl objected,
 pointing at the dateline: July 20, 1933.


 ""You're trying to joke,"" Jack told her.


 ""No, I'm not.""


 ""But it's 1953.""


 ""Now it's you who are joking.""


 ""But the paper's yellow.""


 ""The paper's always yellow.""


 He laughed uneasily. ""Well, if you actually think it's 1933, perhaps
 you're to be envied,"" he said, with a sardonic humor he didn't quite
 feel. ""Then you can't know anything about the Second World War, or
 television, or the V-2s, or Bikini bathing suits, or the atomic bomb,
 or—""


 ""Stop!"" She had sprung up and retreated around her chair, white-faced.
 ""I don't like what you're saying.""


 ""But—""


 ""No, please! Jokes that may be quite harmless on the mainland sound
 different here.""


 ""I'm really not joking,"" he said after a moment.


 She grew quite frantic at that. ""I can show you all last week's papers!
 I can show you magazines and other things. I can prove it!""


 She started toward the house. He followed. He felt his heart begin to
 pound.


 At the white door she paused, looking worriedly down the road. Jack
 thought he could hear the faint
chug
of a motorboat. She pushed open
 the door and he followed her inside. The small-windowed room was dark
 after the sunlight. Jack got an impression of solid old furniture, a
 fireplace with brass andirons.


 ""Flash!"" croaked a gritty voice. ""After their disastrous break day
 before yesterday, stocks are recovering. Leading issues....""


 Jack realized that he had started and had involuntarily put his arm
 around the girl's shoulders. At the same time he noticed that the voice
 was coming from the curved brown trumpet of an old-fashioned radio
 loudspeaker.


 The girl didn't pull away from him. He turned toward her. Although her
 gray eyes were on him, her attention had gone elsewhere.


 ""I can hear the car. They're coming back. They won't like it that
 you're here.""


 ""All right they won't like it.""


 Her agitation grew. ""No, you must go.""


 ""I'll come back tomorrow,"" he heard himself saying.


 ""Flash! It looks as if the World Economic Conference may soon adjourn,
 mouthing jeers at old Uncle Sam who is generally referred to as Uncle
 Shylock.""


 Jack felt a numbness on his neck. The room seemed to be darkening, the
 girl growing stranger still.


 ""You must go before they see you.""


 ""Flash! Wiley Post has just completed his solo circuit of the Globe,
 after a record-breaking flight of 7 days, 18 hours and 45 minutes.
 Asked how he felt after the energy-draining feat, Post quipped....""
He was halfway across the lawn before he realized the terror into which
 the grating radio voice had thrown him.


 He leaped for the branch over-hanging the fence, vaulted up with the
 risky help of a foot on the barbed top. A surprised squirrel, lacking
 time to make its escape up the trunk, sprang to the ground ahead of
 him. With terrible suddenness, two steel-jawed semicircles clanked
 together just over the squirrel's head. Jack landed with one foot to
 either side of the sprung trap, while the squirrel darted off with a
 squeak.


 Jack plunged down the slope to the rocky spine and ran across it, spray
 from the rising waves spattering him to the waist. Panting now, he
 stumbled up into the oaks and undergrowth of the first island, fought
 his way through it, finally reached the silent cove. He loosed the line
 of the
Annie O.
, dragged it as near to the cove's mouth as he could,
 plunged knee-deep in freezing water to give it a final shove, scrambled
 aboard, snatched up the boathook and punched at the rocks.


 As soon as the
Annie O.
was nosing out of the cove into the cross
 waves, he yanked up the sail. The freshening wind filled it and sent
 the sloop heeling over, with inches of white water over the lee rail,
 and plunging ahead.


 For a long while, Jack was satisfied to think of nothing but the wind
 and the waves and the sail and speed and danger, to have all his
 attention taken up balancing one against the other, so that he wouldn't
 have to ask himself what year it was and whether time was an illusion,
 and wonder about flappers and hidden traps.


 When he finally looked back at the island, he was amazed to see how
 tiny it had grown, as distant as the mainland.


 Then he saw a gray motorboat astern. He watched it as it slowly
 overtook him. It was built like a lifeboat, with a sturdy low cabin in
 the bow and wheel amidship. Whoever was at the wheel had long gray hair
 that whipped in the wind. The longer he looked, the surer he was that
 it was a woman wearing a lace dress. Something that stuck up inches
 over the cabin flashed darkly beside her. Only when she lifted it to
 the roof of the cabin did it occur to him that it might be a rifle.


 But just then the motorboat swung around in a turn that sent waves
 drenching over it, and headed back toward the island. He watched it for
 a minute in wonder, then his attention was jolted by an angry hail.


 Three fishing smacks, also headed toward town, were about to cross
 his bow. He came around into the wind and waited with shaking sail,
 watching a man in a lumpy sweater shake a fist at him. Then he turned
 and gratefully followed the dark, wide, fanlike sterns and age-yellowed
 sails.
II


 The exterior of Martin Kesserich's home—a weathered white cube with
 narrow, sharp-paned windows, topped by a cupola—was nothing like its
 lavish interior.


 In much the same way, Mrs. Kesserich clashed with the darkly gleaming
 furniture, persian rugs and bronze vases around her. Her shapeless
 black form, poised awkwardly on the edge of a huge sofa, made Jack
 think of a cow that had strayed into the drawing room. He wondered
 again how a man like Kesserich had come to marry such a creature.


 Yet when she lifted up her little eyes from the shadows, he had the
 uneasy feeling that she knew a great deal about him. The eyes were
 still those of a domestic animal, but of a wise one that has been
 watching the house a long, long while from the barnyard.
He asked abruptly, ""Do you know anything of a girl around here named
 Mary Alice Pope?""


 The silence lasted so long that he began to think she'd gone into some
 bovine trance. Then, without a word, she got up and went over to a tall
 cabinet. Feeling on a ledge behind it for a key, she opened a panel,
 opened a cardboard box inside it, took something from the box and
 handed him a photograph. He held it up to the failing light and sucked
 in his breath with surprise.


 It was a picture of the girl he'd met that afternoon. Same
 flat-bosomed dress—flowered rather than white—no bandeau, same beads.
 Same proud, demure expression, perhaps a bit happier.


 ""That is Mary Alice Pope,"" Mrs. Kesserich said in a strangely flat
 voice. ""She was Martin's fiancee. She was killed in a railway accident
 in 1933.""


 The small sound of the cabinet door closing brought Jack back to
 reality. He realized that he no longer had the photograph. Against the
 gloom by the cabinet, Mrs. Kesserich's white face looked at him with
 what seemed a malicious eagerness.


 ""Sit down,"" she said, ""and I'll tell you about it.""


 Without a thought as to why she hadn't asked him a single question—he
 was much too dazed for that—he obeyed. Mrs. Kesserich resumed her
 position on the edge of the sofa.


 ""You must understand, Mr. Barr, that Mary Alice Pope was the one love
 of Martin's life. He is a man of very deep and strong feelings, yet as
 you probably know, anything but kindly or demonstrative. Even when he
 first came here from Hungary with his older sisters Hani and Hilda,
 there was a cloak of loneliness about him—or rather about the three of
 them.


 ""Hani and Hilda were athletic outdoor women, yet fiercely proud—I
 don't imagine they ever spoke to anyone in America except as to a
 servant—and with a seething distaste for all men except Martin. They
 showered all their devotion on him. So of course, though Martin didn't
 realize it, they were consumed with jealousy when he fell in love with
 Mary Alice Pope. They'd thought that since he'd reached forty without
 marrying, he was safe.


 ""Mary Alice came from a pure-bred, or as a biologist would say, inbred
 British stock. She was very young, but very sweet, and up to a point
 very wise. She sensed Hani and Hilda's feelings right away and did
 everything she could to win them over. For instance, though she was
 afraid of horses, she took up horseback riding, because that was Hani
 and Hilda's favorite pastime. Naturally, Martin knew nothing of her
 fear, and naturally his sisters knew about it from the first. But—and
 here is where Mary's wisdom fell short—her brave gesture did not
 pacify them: it only increased their hatred.


 ""Except for his research, Martin was blind to everything but his love.
 It was a beautiful and yet frightening passion, an insane cherishing as
 narrow and intense as his sisters hatred.""
With a start, Jack remembered that it was Mrs. Kesserich telling him
 all this.


 She went on, ""Martin's love directed his every move. He was building a
 home for himself and Mary, and in his mind he was building a wonderful
 future for them as well—not vaguely, if you know Martin, but year by
 year, month by month. This winter, he'd plan, they would visit Buenos
 Aires, next summer they would sail down the inland passage and he would
 teach Mary Hungarian for their trip to Buda-Pesth the year after, where
 he would occupy a chair at the university for a few months ... and so
 on. Finally the time for their marriage drew near. Martin had been
 away. His research was keeping him very busy—""


 Jack broke in with, ""Wasn't that about the time he did his definitive
 work on growth and fertilization?""


 Mrs. Kesserich nodded with solemn appreciation in the gathering
 darkness. ""But now he was coming home, his work done. It was early
 evening, very chilly, but Hani and Hilda felt they had to ride down to
 the station to meet their brother. And although she dreaded it, Mary
 rode with them, for she knew how delighted he would be at her cantering
 to the puffing train and his running up to lift her down from the
 saddle to welcome him home.


 ""Of course there was Martin's luggage to be considered, so the station
 wagon had to be sent down for that."" She looked defiantly at Jack. ""I
 drove the station wagon. I was Martin's laboratory assistant.""


 She paused. ""It was almost dark, but there was still a white cold
 line of sky to the west. Hani and Hilda, with Mary between them, were
 waiting on their horses at the top of the hill that led down to the
 station. The train had whistled and its headlight was graying the
 gravel of the crossing.


 ""Suddenly Mary's horse squealed and plunged down the hill. Hani and
 Hilda followed—to try to catch her, they said, but they didn't manage
 that, only kept her horse from veering off. Mary never screamed, but as
 her horse reared on the tracks, I saw her face in the headlight's glare.


 ""Martin must have guessed, or at least feared what had happened, for he
 was out of the train and running along the track before it stopped. In
 fact, he was the first to kneel down beside Mary—I mean, what had been
 Mary—and was holding her all bloody and shattered in his arms.""


 A door slammed. There were steps in the hall. Mrs. Kesserich stiffened
 and was silent. Jack turned.


 The blur of a face hung in the doorway to the hall—a seemingly young,
 sensitive, suavely handsome face with aristocratic jaw. Then there was
 a click and the lights flared up and Jack saw the close-cropped gray
 hair and the lines around the eyes and nostrils, while the sensitive
 mouth grew sardonic. Yet the handsomeness stayed, and somehow the
 youth, too, or at least a tremendous inner vibrancy.


 ""Hello, Barr,"" Martin Kesserich said, ignoring his wife.


 The great biologist had come home.
III


 ""Oh, yes, and Jamieson had a feeble paper on what he called
 individualization in marine worms. Barr, have you ever thought much
 about the larger aspects of the problem of individuality?""


 Jack jumped slightly. He had let his thoughts wander very far.


 ""Not especially, sir,"" he mumbled.


 The house was still. A few minutes after the professor's arrival,
 Mrs. Kesserich had gone off with an anxious glance at Jack. He knew
 why and wished he could reassure her that he would not mention their
 conversation to the professor.


 Kesserich had spent perhaps a half hour briefing him on the more
 important papers delivered at the conferences. Then, almost as if
 it were a teacher's trick to show up a pupil's inattention, he had
 suddenly posed this question about individuality.


 ""You know what I mean, of course,"" Kesserich pressed. ""The factors that
 make you you, and me me.""


 ""Heredity and environment,"" Jack parroted like a freshman.


 Kesserich nodded. ""Suppose—this is just speculation—that we could
 control heredity and environment. Then we could re-create the same
 individual at will.""


 Jack felt a shiver go through him. ""To get exactly the same pattern of
 hereditary traits. That'd be far beyond us.""


 ""What about identical twins?"" Kesserich pointed out. ""And then there's
 parthenogenesis to be considered. One might produce a duplicate of the
 mother without the intervention of the male."" Although his voice had
 grown more idly speculative, Kesserich seemed to Jack to be smiling
 secretly. ""There are many examples in the lower animal forms, to say
 nothing of the technique by which Loeb caused a sea urchin to reproduce
 with no more stimulus than a salt solution.""


 Jack felt the hair rising on his neck. ""Even then you wouldn't get
 exactly the same pattern of hereditary traits.""


 ""Not if the parent were of very pure stock? Not if there were some
 special technique for selecting ova that would reproduce all the
 mother's traits?""


 ""But environment would change things,"" Jack objected. ""The duplicate
 would be bound to develop differently.""


 ""Is environment so important? Newman tells about a pair of identical
 twins separated from birth, unaware of each other's existence. They met
 by accident when they were twenty-one. Each was a telephone repairman.
 Each had a wife the same age. Each had a baby son. And each had a fox
 terrier called 'Trixie.' That's without trying to make environments
 similar. But suppose you did try. Suppose you saw to it that each of
 them had exactly the same experiences at the same times....""


 For a moment it seemed to Jack that the room was dimming and wavering,
 becoming a dark pool in which the only motionless thing was Kesserich's
 sphinx-like face.


 ""Well, we've escaped quite far enough from Jamieson's marine worms,""
 the biologist said, all brisk again. He said it as if Jack were the
 one who had led the conversation down wild and unprofitable channels.
 ""Let's get on to your project. I want to talk it over now, because I
 won't have any time for it tomorrow.""


 Jack looked at him blankly.


 ""Tomorrow I must attend to a very important matter,"" the biologist
 explained.
IV


 Morning sunlight brightened the colors of the wax flowers under glass
 on the high bureau that always seemed to emit the faint odor of old
 hair combings. Jack pulled back the diamond-patterned quilt and blinked
 the sleep from his eyes. He expected his mind to be busy wondering
 about Kesserich and his wife—things said and half said last night—but
 found instead that his thoughts swung instantly to Mary Alice Pope, as
 if to a farthest island in a world of people.


 Downstairs, the house was empty. After a long look at the cabinet—he
 felt behind it, but the key was gone—he hurried down to the
 waterfront. He stopped only for a bowl of chowder and, as an
 afterthought, to buy half a dozen newspapers.


 The sea was bright, the brisk wind just right for the
Annie O.
There
 was eagerness in the way it smacked the sail and in the creak of the
 mast. And when he reached the cove, it was no longer still, but nervous
 with faint ripples, as if time had finally begun to stir.


 After the same struggle with the underbrush, he came out on the rocky
 spine and passed the cove of the sea urchins. The spiny creatures
 struck an uncomfortable chord in his memory.


 This time he climbed the second island cautiously, scraping the
 innocent-seeming ground ahead of him intently with a boathook he'd
 brought along for the purpose. He was only a few yards from the fence
 when he saw Mary Alice Pope standing behind it.


 He hadn't realized that his heart would begin to pound or that, at the
 same time, a shiver of almost supernatural dread would go through him.


 The girl eyed him with an uneasy hostility and immediately began to
 speak in a hushed, hurried voice. ""You must go away at once and never
 come back. You're a wicked man, but I don't want you to be hurt. I've
 been watching for you all morning.""


 He tossed the newspapers over the fence. ""You don't have to read
 them now,"" he told her. ""Just look at the datelines and a few of the
 headlines.""


 When she finally lifted her eyes to his again, she was trembling. She
 tried unsuccessfully to speak.


 ""Listen to me,"" he said. ""You've been the victim of a scheme to make
 you believe you were born around 1916 instead of 1933, and that it's
 1933 now instead of 1951. I'm not sure why it's been done, though I
 think I know who you really are.""


 ""But,"" the girl faltered, ""my aunts tell me it's 1933.""


 ""They would.""


 ""And there are the papers ... the magazines ... the radio.""


 ""The papers are old ones. The radio's faked—some sort of recording. I
 could show you if I could get at it.""


 ""
These
papers might be faked,"" she said, pointing to where she'd let
 them drop on the ground.


 ""They're new,"" he said. ""Only old papers get yellow.""


 ""But why would they do it to me?
Why?
""


 ""Come with me to the mainland, Mary. That'll set you straight quicker
 than anything.""


 ""I couldn't,"" she said, drawing back. ""He's coming tonight.""


 ""He?""


 ""The man who sends me the boxes ... and my life.""


 Jack shivered. When he spoke, his voice was rough and quick. ""A life
 that's completely a lie, that's cut you off from the world. Come with
 me, Mary.""

The plagues that struck mankind could be attributed

 to one man. But was he fiend ... or savior?
The blood was added to a pool of other blood, mixed, centrifuged,
 separated to plasma and corpuscles, irradiated slightly, pasteurized
 slightly, frozen, evaporated, and finally banked. Some of the plasma
 was used immediately for a woman who had bled too much in childbirth.


 She died.


 Others received plasma and did not die. But their symptoms changed,
 including a syndrome of multiple endocrine unbalance, eccentricities of
 appetite and digestion, and a general pattern of emotional disturbance.


 An alert hospital administrator investigated the mortality rise and
 narrowed it to a question of who had donated blood the week before.
 After city residents were eliminated, there remained only the signed
 receipts and thumbprints of nine men. Nine healthy unregistered
 travelers poor enough to sell their blood for money, and among them a
 man who carried death in his veins. The nine thumbprints were broadcast
 to all police files and a search began.


 The effort was futile, for there were many victims who had sickened and
 grown partially well again without recognizing the strangeness of their
 illness.


 Three years later they reached the carrier stage and the epidemic
 spread to four cities. Three more years, and there was an epidemic
 which spread around the world, meeting another wave coming from the
 opposite direction. It killed two out of four, fifty out of a hundred,
 twenty-seven million out of fifty million. There was hysteria where
 it appeared. And where it had not appeared there were quarantines to
 fence it out. But it could not be fenced out. For two years it covered
 the world. And then it vanished again, leaving the survivors with a
 tendency toward glandular troubles.


 Time passed. The world grew richer, more orderly, more peaceful.


 A man paused in the midst of his work at the U.N. Food and Agriculture
 Commission. He looked up at the red and green production map of India.


 ""Just too many people per acre,"" he said. ""All our work at improving
 production ... just one jump ahead of their rising population, one jump
 ahead of famine. Sometimes I wish to God there would be another plague
 to give us a breathing spell and a fair chance to get things organized.""


 He went back to work and added another figure.


 Two months later, he was one of the first victims of the second plague.
In the dining hall of a university, a biochemical student glanced up
 from his paper to his breakfast companion. ""You remember Johnny, the
 mythical carrier that they told about during the first and second
 epidemics of Syndrome Plague?""


 ""Sure. Syndrome Johnny. They use that myth in psychology class as a
 typical example of mass hysteria. When a city was nervous and expecting
 the plague to reach them, some superstitious fool would imagine he saw
 Syndrome Johnny and the population would panic. Symbol for Death or
 some such thing. People imagined they saw him in every corner of the
 world. Simultaneously, of course.""


 It was a bright morning and they were at a window which looked out
 across green rolling fields to a towering glass-brick building in the
 distance.


 The student who had gone back to his paper suddenly looked up again.
 ""Some Peruvians here claim they saw Syndrome Johnny—""


 ""Idiotic superstition! You'd think it would have died down when the
 plague died.""


 The other grinned. ""The plague didn't die."" He folded his newspaper
 slowly, obviously advancing an opening for a debate.


 His companion went on eating. ""Another of your wild theories, huh?""
 Then through a mouthful of food: ""All right, if the plague didn't die,
 where did it go?""


 ""Nowhere.
We have it now.
We all have it!"" He shrugged. ""A virus
 catalyst of high affinity for the cells and a high similarity to a
 normal cell protein—how can it be detected?""


 ""Then why don't people die? Why aren't we sick?""


 ""Because we have sickened and recovered. We caught it on conception
 and recovered before birth. Proof? Why do you think that the countries
 which were known as the Hungry Lands are now well-fed, leisured,
 educated, advanced? Because the birth rate has fallen! Why has the
 birth rate fallen?"" He paused, then very carefully said, ""Because two
 out of three of all people who would have lived have died before birth,
 slain by Syndrome Plague. We are all carriers now, hosts to a new
 guest. And""—his voice dropped to a mock sinister whisper—""with such a
 stranger within our cells, at the heart of the intricate machinery of
 our lives, who knows what subtle changes have crept upon us unnoticed!""


 His companion laughed. ""Eat your breakfast. You belong on a horror
 program!""
A police psychologist for the Federated States of The Americas was
 running through reports from the Bureau of Social Statistics. Suddenly
 he grunted, then a moment later said, ""Uh-huh!""


 ""Uh-huh what?"" asked his superior, who was reading a newspaper with his
 feet up on the desk.


 ""Remember the myth, of Syndrome Johnny?""


 ""Ghost of Syndrome Plague. Si, what of it?""


 ""Titaquahapahel, Peru, population nine hundred, sent in a claim that he
 turned up there and they almost caught him. Crime Statistics rerouted
 the report to Mass Phenomena, of course. Mass Phenomena blew a tube and
 sent their folder on Syndrome Johnny over here. Every report they ever
 had on him for ninety years back! A memo came with it."" He handed the
 memo over.


 The man behind the desk looked at it. It was a small graph and some
 mathematical symbols. ""What is it?""


 ""It means,"" said the psychologist, smiling dryly, ""that every crazy
 report about our ghost has points of similarity to every other crazy
 report. The whole business of Syndrome Johnny has been in their 'funny
 coincidence' file for twenty years. This time the suspect hits the
 averaged description of Johnny too closely: A solid-looking man,
 unusual number of visible minor scars, and a disturbing habit of
 bending his fingers at the first-joint knuckles when he is thinking.
 The coincidence has gotten too damn funny. There's a chance we've been
 passing up a crime.""


 ""An extensive crime,"" said the man at the desk softly. He reached
 for the folder. ""Yes, a considerable quantity of murder."" He leafed
 through the folder and then thought a while, looking at the most recent
 reports. Thinking was what he was paid for, and he earned his excellent
 salary.


 ""This thumbprint on the hotel register—the name is false, but the
 thumbprint looks real. Could we persuade the Bureau of Records to give
 their data on that print?""


 ""Without a warrant? Against constitutional immunity. No, not a chance.
 The public has been touchy about the right to secrecy ever since that
 police state was attempted in Varga.""


 ""How about persuading an obliging judge to give a warrant on grounds of
 reasonable suspicion?""


 ""No. We'd have the humanist press down on our necks in a minute, and
 any judge knows it. We'd have to prove a crime was committed. No crime,
 no warrant.""


 ""It seems a pity we can't even find out who the gentleman is,"" the
 Crimes Department head murmured, looking at the thumbprint wistfully.
 ""No crime, no records. No records, no evidence. No evidence, no proof
 of crime. Therefore, we must manufacture a small crime. He was attacked
 and he must have defended himself. Someone may have been hurt in the
 process."" He pushed a button. ""Do you think if I send a man down there,
 he could persuade one of the mob to swear out a complaint?""


 ""That's a rhetorical question,"" said the psychologist, trying to work
 out an uncertain correlation in his reports. ""With that sort of mob
 hysteria, the town would probably give you an affidavit of witchcraft.""
""Phone for you, Doctor Alcala."" The nurse was crisp but quiet, smiling
 down at the little girl before vanishing again.


 Ricardo Alcala pushed the plunger in gently, then carefully withdrew
 the hypodermic needle from the little girl's arm. ""There you are,
 Cosita,"" he said, smiling and rising from the chair beside the white
 bed.


 ""Will that make me better, Doctor?"" she piped feebly.


 He patted her hand. ""Be a good girl and you will be well tomorrow."" He
 walked out into the hospital corridor to where the desk nurse held out
 a phone.


 ""Alcala speaking.""


 The voice was unfamiliar. ""My deepest apologies for interrupting your
 work, Doctor. At this late hour I'm afraid I assumed you would be at
 home. The name is Camba, Federation Investigator on a health case. I
 would like to consult you.""


 Alcala was tired, but there was nothing to do at home. Nita was at the
 health resort and Johnny had borrowed all his laboratory space for a
 special synthesis of some sort, and probably would be too busy even
 to talk. Interest stirred in him. This was a Federation investigator
 calling; the man's work was probably important. ""Tonight, if that's
 convenient. I'll be off duty in five minutes.""


 Thirty minutes later they were ordering in a small cantina down the
 street from the hospital.


 Julio Camba, Federation Investigator, was a slender, dark man with
 sharp, glinting eyes. He spoke with a happy theatrical flourish.


 ""Order what you choose, Senor. We're on my expense account. The
 resources of the Federated States of all The Americas stand behind your
 menu.""


 Alcala smiled. ""I wouldn't want to add to the national debt.""


 ""Not at all, Senor. The Federated States are only too happy thus to
 express a fraction of their gratitude by adding a touch of luxury to
 the otherwise barren and self-sacrificing life of a scientist.""


 ""You shame me,"" Alcala said dryly. It was true that he needed
 every spare penny for the health of Nita and the child, and for the
 laboratory. A penny saved from being spent on nourishment was a penny
 earned. He picked up the menu again and ordered steak.


 The investigator lit a cigar, asking casually: ""Do you know John
 Osborne Drake?""
Alcala searched his memory. ""No. I'm sorry...."" Then he felt for the
 first time how closely he was being watched, and knew how carefully his
 reaction and the tone of his voice had been analyzed. The interview was
 dangerous. For some reason, he was suspected of something.


 Camba finished lighting the cigar and dropped the match into an
 ash-tray. ""Perhaps you know John Delgados?"" He leaned back into the
 shadowy corner of the booth.


 Johnny! Out of all the people in the world, how could the government be
 interested in him? Alcala tried to sound casual. ""An associate of mine.
 A friend.""


 ""I would like to contact the gentleman."" The request was completely
 unforceful, undemanding. ""I called, but he was not at home. Could you
 tell me where he might be?""


 ""I'm sorry, Senor Camba, but I cannot say. He could be on a business
 trip."" Alcala was feeling increasingly nervous. Actually, Johnny was
 working at his laboratory.


 ""What do you know of his activities?"" Camba asked.


 ""A biochemist."" Alcala tried to see past the meditative mask of the
 thin dark face. ""He makes small job-lots of chemical compounds. Special
 bug spray for sale to experimental plantations, hormone spray for
 fruits, that sort of thing. Sometimes, when he collects some money
 ahead, he does research.""


 Camba waited, and his silence became a question. Alcala spoke
 reluctantly, anger rising in him. ""Oh, it's genuine research. He has
 some patents and publications to his credit. You can confirm that if
 you choose."" He was unable to keep the hostility out of his voice.


 A waiter came and placed steaming platters of food on the table. Camba
 waited until he was gone. ""You know him well, I presume. Is he sane?""


 The question was another shock. Alcala thought carefully, for any man
 might be insane in secret. ""Yes, so far as I know."" He turned his
 attention to the steak, but first took three very large capsules from a
 bottle in his pocket.


 ""I would not expect that a doctor would need to take pills,"" Camba
 remarked with friendly mockery.


 ""I don't need them,"" Alcala explained. ""Mixed silicones. I'm guinea
 pigging.""


 ""Can't such things be left to the guinea pigs?"" Camba asked, watching
 with revulsion as Alcala uncapped the second bottle and sprinkled a
 layer of gray powder over his steak.


 ""Guinea pigs have no assimilation of silicones; only man has that.""


 ""Yes, of course. I should have remembered from your famous papers,
The
 Need Of Trace Silicon In Human Diet
and
Silicon Deficiency Diseases
.""
Obviously Camba had done considerable investigating of Alcala before
 approaching him. He had even given the titles of the research papers
 correctly. Alcala's wariness increased.


 ""What is the purpose of the experiment this time?"" asked the small dark
 Federation agent genially.


 ""To determine the safe limits of silicon consumption and if there are
 any dangers in an overdose.""


 ""How do you determine that? By dropping dead?""


 He could be right. Perhaps the test should be stopped. Every day, with
 growing uneasiness, Alcala took his dose of silicon compound, and every
 day, the chemical seemed to be absorbed completely—not released or
 excreted—in a way that was unpleasantly reminiscent of the way arsenic
 accumulated without evident damage, then killed abruptly without
 warning.
Already, this evening, he had noticed that there was something faulty
 about his coordination and weight and surface sense. The restaurant
 door had swung back with a curious lightness, and the hollow metal
 handle had had a curious softness under his fingers. Something merely
 going wrong with the sensitivity of his fingers—?


 He tapped his fingertips on the heavy indestructible silicone plastic
 table top. There was a feeling of heaviness in his hands, and a feeling
 of faint rubbery
give
in the table.


 Tapping his fingers gently, his heavy fingers ... the answer was
 dreamily fantastic.
I'm turning into silicon plastic myself
, he
 thought. But how, why? He had not bothered to be curious before, but
 the question had always been—what were supposedly insoluble silicons
 doing assimilating into the human body at all?


 Several moments passed. He smoothed back his hair with his oddly heavy
 hand before picking up his fork again.


 ""I'm turning into plastic,"" he told Camba.


 ""I beg your pardon?""


 ""Nothing. A joke.""


 Camba was turning into plastic, too. Everyone was. But the effect was
 accumulating slowly, by generations.
Camba lay down his knife and started in again. ""What connections have
 you had with John Delgados?""
Concentrate on the immediate situation.
Alcala and Johnny were
 obviously in danger of some sort of mistaken arrest and interrogation.


 As Alcala focused on the question, one errant whimsical thought
 suddenly flitted through the back of his mind. In red advertising
 letters: TRY OUR NEW MODEL RUST-PROOF, WATERPROOF, HEAT &amp; SCALD
 RESISTANT, STRONG—EXTRA-LONG-WEARING HUMAN BEING!


 He laughed inwardly and finally answered: ""Friendship. Mutual interest
 in high ion colloidal suspensions and complex synthesis."" Impatience
 suddenly mastered him. ""Exactly what is it you wish to know, Senor?
 Perhaps I could inform you if I knew the reasons for your interest.""


 Camba chose a piece of salad with great care. ""We have reason to
 believe that he is Syndrome Johnny.""


 Alcala waited for the words to clarify. After a moment, it ceased to
 be childish babble and became increasingly shocking. He remembered the
 first time he had met John Delgados, the smile, the strong handclasp.
 ""Call me Johnny,"" he had said. It had seemed no more than a nickname.


 The investigator was watching his expression with bright brown eyes.


 Johnny, yes ... but not Syndrome Johnny. He tried to think of some
 quick refutation. ""The whole thing is preposterous, Senor Camba. The
 myth of Syndrome Plague Johnny started about a century ago.""


 ""Doctor Alcala""—the small man in the gray suit was tensely
 sober—""John Delgados is very old, and John Delgados is not his proper
 name. I have traced his life back and back, through older and older
 records in Argentina, Panama, South Africa, the United States, China,
 Canada. Everywhere he has paid his taxes properly, put his fingerprints
 on file as a good citizen should. And he changed his name every twenty
 years, applying to the courts for permission with good honest reasons
 for changing his name. Everywhere he has been a laboratory worker, held
 patents, sometimes made a good deal of money. He is one hundred and
 forty years old. His first income tax was paid in 1970, exactly one
 hundred and twenty years ago.""


 ""Other men are that old,"" said Alcala.


 ""Other men are old, yes. Those who survived the two successive plagues,
 were unusually durable."" Camba finished and pushed back his plate.
 ""There is no crime in being long-lived, surely. But he has changed his
 name five times!""


 ""That proves nothing. Whatever his reasons for changing his name, it
 doesn't prove that he is Syndrome Johnny any more than it proves he
 is the cow that jumped over the moon. Syndrome Johnny is a myth, a
 figment of mob delirium.""
As he said it, he knew it was not true. A Federation investigator would
 not be on a wild goose chase.


 The plates were taken away and cups of steaming black coffee put
 between them. He would have to warn Johnny. It was strange how well you
 could know a man as well as he knew Johnny, firmly enough to believe
 that, despite evidence, everything the man did was right.


 ""Why must it be a myth?"" Camba asked softly.


 ""It's ridiculous!"" Alcala protested. ""Why would any man—"" His voice
 cut off as unrelated facts fell into a pattern. He sat for a moment,
 thinking intensely, seeing the century of plague as something he had
 never dreamed....


 A price.


 Not too high a price in the long run, considering what was purchased.
 Of course, the great change over into silicon catalysis would be a
 shock and require adjustment and, of course, the change must be made in
 several easy stages—and those who could not adjust would die.


 ""Go on, Doctor,"" Camba urged softly. ""'
Why
would any man—'""


 He tried to find a way of explaining which would not seem to have any
 relationship to John Delgados. ""It has been recently discovered""—but
 he did not say
how
recently—""that the disease of Syndrome Plague
 was not a disease. It is an improvement."" He had spoken clumsily.


 ""An improvement on life?"" Camba laughed and nodded, but there were
 bitterness and anger burning behind the small man's smile. ""People
 can be improved to death by the millions. Yes, yes, go on, Senor. You
 fascinate me.""


 ""We are stronger,"" Alcala told him. ""We are changed chemically. The
 race has been improved!""


 ""Come, Doctor Alcala,"" Camba said with a sneering merriment, ""the
 Syndrome Plagues have come and they have gone. Where is this change?""


 Alcala tried to express it clearly. ""We are stronger. Potentially, we
 are tremendously stronger. But we of this generation are still weak
 and ill, as our parents were, from the shock of the change. And we
 need silicone feeding; we have not adjusted yet. Our illness masks our
 strength."" He thought of what that strength would be!


 Camba smiled and took out a small notebook. ""The disease is connected
 with silicones, you say? The original name of John Delgados was John
 Osborne Drake. His father was Osborne Drake, a chemist at Dow Corning,
 who was sentenced to the electric chair in 1967 for unauthorized
 bacterial experiments which resulted in an accidental epidemic and
 eight deaths. Dow Corning was the first major manufactury of silicones
 in America, though not connected in any way with Osborne Drake's
 criminal experiments. It links together, does it not?""


 ""It is not a disease, it is strength!"" Alcala insisted doggedly.
The small investigator looked up from his notebook and his smile was
 an unnatural thing, a baring of teeth. ""Half the world died of this
 strength, Senor. If you will not think of the men and women, think of
 the children. Millions of children died!""


 The waiter brought the bill, dropping it on the table between them.


 ""Lives will be saved in the long run,"" Alcala said obstinately.
 ""Individual deaths are not important in the long run.""


 ""That is hardly the philosophy for a doctor, is it?"" asked Camba with
 open irony, taking the bill and rising.


 They went out of the restaurant in silence. Camba's 'copter stood at
 the curb.


 ""Would you care for a lift home, Doctor Alcala?"" The offer was made
 with the utmost suavity.


 Alcala hesitated fractionally. ""Why, yes, thank you."" It would not do
 to give the investigator any reason for suspicion by refusing.


 As the 'copter lifted into the air, Camba spoke with a more friendly
 note in his voice, as if he humored a child. ""Come, Alcala, you're a
 doctor dedicated to saving lives. How can you find sympathy for a
 murderer?""


 Alcala sat in the dark, looking through the windshield down at the
 bright street falling away below. ""I'm not a practicing medico; only
 one night a week do I come to the hospital. I'm a research man. I don't
 try to save individual lives. I'm dedicated to improving the average
 life, the average health. Can you understand that? Individuals may be
 sick and individuals may die, but the average lives on. And if the
 average is better, then I'm satisfied.""


 The 'copter flew on. There was no answer.


 ""I'm not good with words,"" said Alcala. Then, taking out his pen-knife
 and unfolding it, he said, ""Watch!"" He put his index finger on the
 altimeter dial, where there was light, and pressed the blade against
 the flesh between his finger and his thumb. He increased the pressure
 until the flesh stood out white on either side of the blade, bending,
 but not cut.


 ""Three generations back, this pressure would have gone right through
 the hand."" He took away the blade and there was only a very tiny cut.
 Putting the knife away, he brought out his lighter. The blue flame
 was steady and hot. Alcala held it close to the dashboard and put his
 finger directly over it, counting patiently, ""One, two, three, four,
 five—"" He pulled the lighter back, snapping it shut.
""Three generations ago, a man couldn't have held a finger over that
 flame for more than a tenth part of that count. Doesn't all this prove
 something to you?""


 The 'copter was hovering above Alcala's house. Camba lowered it to
 the ground and opened the door before answering. ""It proves only that
 a good and worthy man will cut and burn his hand for an unworthy
 friendship. Good night.""


 Disconcerted, Alcala watched the 'copter lift away into the night,
 then, turning, saw that the lights were still on in the laboratory.
 Camba might have deduced something from that, if he knew that Nita and
 the girl were not supposed to be home.


 Alcala hurried in.


 Johnny hadn't left yet. He was sitting at Alcala's desk with his feet
 on the wastebasket, the way Alcala often liked to sit, reading a
 technical journal. He looked up, smiling. For a moment Alcala saw him
 with the new clarity of a stranger. The lean, weathered face; brown
 eyes with smile deltas at the corners; wide shoulders; steady, big
 hands holding the magazine—solid, able, and ruthless enough to see
 what had to be done, and do it.


 ""I was waiting for you, Ric.""


 ""The Feds are after you."" Ricardo Alcala had been running. He found he
 was panting and his heart was pounding.


 Delgados' smile did not change. ""It's all right, Ric. Everything's
 done. I can leave any time now."" He indicated a square metal box
 standing in a corner. ""There's the stuff.""


 What stuff? The product Johnny had been working on? ""You haven't time
 for that now, Johnny. You can't sell it. They'd watch for anyone of
 your description selling chemicals. Let me loan you some money.""


 ""Thanks."" Johnny was smiling oddly. ""Everything's set. I won't need it.
 How close are they to finding me?""


 ""They don't know where you're staying."" Alcala leaned on the desk edge
 and put out his hand. ""They tell me you're Syndrome Johnny.""


 ""I thought you'd figured that one out."" Johnny shook his hand formally.
 ""The name is John Osborne Drake. You aren't horrified?""


 ""No."" Alcala knew that he was shaking hands with a man who would be
 thanked down all the successive generations of mankind. He noticed
 again the odd white web-work of scars on the back of Johnny's hand. He
 indicated them as casually as he could. ""Where did you pick those up?""
John Drake glanced at his hand. ""I don't know, Ric. Truthfully.
 I've had my brains beaten in too often to remember much any more.
 Unimportant. There are instructions outlining plans and methods filed
 in safety deposit boxes in almost every big city in the world. Always
 the same typing, always the same instructions. I can't remember who
 typed them, myself or my father, but I must have been expected to
 forget or they wouldn't be there. Up to eleven, my memory is all right,
 but after Dad started to remake me, everything gets fuzzy.""


 ""After he did
what
?""


 Johnny smiled tiredly and rested his head on one hand. ""He had to
 remake me chemically, you know. How could I spread change without
 being changed myself? I couldn't have two generations to adapt to
 it naturally like you, Ric. It had to be done artificially. It took
 years. You understand? I'm a community, a construction. The cells that
 carry on the silicon metabolism in me are not human. Dad adapted them
 for the purpose. I helped, but I can't remember any longer how it was
 done. I think when I've been badly damaged, organization scatters to
 the separate cells in my body. They can survive better that way, and
 they have powers of regrouping and healing. But memory can't be pasted
 together again or regrown.""


 John Drake rose and looked around the laboratory with something like
 triumph. ""They're too late. I made it, Ric. There's the catalyst
 cooling over there. This is the last step. I don't think I'll survive
 this plague, but I'll last long enough to set it going for the finish.
 The police won't stop me until it's too late.""
Another plague!


 The last one had been before Alcala was born. He had not thought that
 Johnny would start another. It was a shock.


 Alcala walked over to the cage where he kept his white mice and looked
 in, trying to sort out his feelings. The white mice looked back
 with beady bright eyes, caged, not knowing they were waiting to be
 experimented upon.


 A timer clicked and John Delgados-Drake became all rapid efficient
 activity, moving from valve to valve. It lasted a half minute or less,
 then Drake had finished stripping off the lab whites to his street
 clothes. He picked up the square metal box containing the stuff he had
 made, tucked it under his arm and held out a solid hand again to Alcala.


 ""Good-by, Ric. Wish me luck. Close up the lab for me, will you?""


 Alcala took the hand numbly and mumbled something, turned back to the
 cages and stared blindly at the mice. Drake's brisk footsteps clattered
 down the stairs.
Another step forward for the human race.


 God knew what wonders for the race were in that box. Perhaps something
 for nerve construction, something for the mind—the last and most
 important step. He should have asked.


 There came at last a pressure that was a thought emerging from the
 depth of intuition.
Doctor Ricardo Alcala will die in the next plague,
 he and his ill wife Nita and his ill little girl.... And the name of
 Alcala will die forever as a weak strain blotted from the bloodstream
 of the race....
He'd find out what was in the box by dying of it!


 He tried to reason it out, but only could remember that Nita, already
 sickly, would have no chance. And Alcala's family genes, in attempting
 to adapt to the previous steps, had become almost sterile. It had been
 difficult having children. The next step would mean complete sterility.
 The name of Alcala would die. The future might be wonderful, but it
 would not be
his
future!


 ""Johnny!"" he called suddenly, something like an icy lump hardening in
 his chest. How long had it been since Johnny had left?


 Running, Alcala went down the long half-lit stairs, out the back door
 and along the dark path toward the place where Johnny's 'copter had
 been parked.


 A light shone through the leaves. It was still there.


 ""Johnny!""


 John Osborne Drake was putting his suitcase into the rear of the
 'copter.


 ""What is it, Ric?"" he asked in a friendly voice without turning.
It would be impossible to ask him to change his mind.
Alcala found
 a rock, raised it behind Syndrome Johnny's back. ""I know I'm being
 anti-social,"" he said regretfully, and then threw the rock away.


 His fist was enough like stone to crush a skull.

20047,20047_ULK48CU1,13,1007,Slate,The Norplant Option,1996,Stuart Taylor Jr.,Periodicals; Specialized Magazine; Media Coverage,"The Norplant Option 

         Now that Congress and President Clinton have opted to use the threat of utter destitution to dissuade poor teen-agers and women from having children on the public dole, it's time to revive a more humane, and perhaps more effective, proposal with the same objective. 

         This idea surfaced briefly and spectacularly in 1990, when the Philadelphia Inquirer suggested in an editorial that perhaps some welfare mothers should be ""offered an increased benefit"" if they would agree to practice effective birth control--specifically, to use the then-new Norplant contraceptive, which prevents pregnancy for five years after being implanted under the skin of the upper arm. 

         An uproar followed. The editorial writers--who had insensitively suggested a desire to reduce births of poor black babies in particular--were savaged by many Inquirer staffers and others as racist advocates of eugenics, even of ""genocide."" They also caught it from some abortion-rights zealots, who are suspicious of any government efforts to influence reproductive choices, and from conservatives, who think the only proper way to discourage teen pregnancy is to preach abstinence. The newspaper abjectly apologized for a ""misguided and wrongheaded editorial opinion."" And ever since, the whole subject has been taboo. 

          But it's still a good idea, for poor girls and women themselves, and for the rest of us. Millions of babies are being born to poor teen-agers so lacking in elementary skills, work habits, and self-discipline that they are unlikely to be either responsible parents or self-supporting providers. Many of these babies grow up in squalor and themselves become dependent denizens of the welfare culture. 

         The only realistic hope for breaking the bleak cycle of teen pregnancy and welfare dependency is to find ways to persuade poor teen-agers not to have babies--at least, not until they are old enough, and capable enough, and self-supporting enough to provide a decent home life. But nobody--nobody--has any great ideas for realizing this hope, short of reverting to the cruelest, let-'em-starve brand of social Darwinism. 

          Thoughtful progressives like Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., have properly stressed the need to push welfare mothers into jobs and job-training programs. This makes sense because some of these women will rise to the occasion, learn the work ethic, and become self-supporting. And others may be dissuaded from having children by the prospect of being required to work. But (as Moynihan acknowledges) many welfare mothers are so crippled by their own early childhood environments as to be essentially unemployable, no matter how well-financed and well-run the jobs programs and related counseling, training, and child-care programs. 

         And under the harsh new welfare reform, the jobs programs will not be well financed. It appears that millions of welfare mothers and children will simply be cut off--unable to get or hold jobs, and left to beg from relatives and strangers, to steal what they can, even to sleep on the streets, depending on how much Calcutta-style misery the taxpayers are willing to tolerate. 

         Given the stark ugliness of trying to end the welfare culture by spreading homelessness and hunger, it's especially striking that one pretty good, pretty humane idea has been virtually ignored in the welfare debate of the past year. 

          In a small effort to reopen discussion of this option, here's a specific proposal: States should experiment with programs in which all qualifying teen-agers and women would be offered lump-sum $1,000 cash payments--on top of any other benefits they receive--to have Norplant (or another long-term contraceptive) implanted at government expense. They would be free to have it removed whenever they chose, but would be rewarded with additional payments (of, say, $30) for each month in which they kept it. 

         The category of qualifying teen-agers and women could include all recipients of welfare or other public assistance (including daughters of recipients) who are competent to give informed consent to the implant procedure. Or the program could be restricted in various ways in order to blunt possible objections. For example, you could require parental consent. Or, eligibility could be restricted to those who have already been pregnant, or at least sexually active; to those over age 13, or under age 21; or some combination thereof. 

          Why Norplant? Because it requires no ongoing effort or supervision to be effective, and it can be discontinued only after some (rather small) effort. As such, Norplant is the only contraceptive the government could pay people to use with any hope of affecting those who aren't strongly motivated to either become pregnant or avoid pregnancy. 

         How much good the Norplant option would do is debatable. But the arguments that it would do harm seem unpersuasive. Here's a quick review of possible objections, left and right: 

          B ribing poor women and girls to implant Norplant would coerce them into not having children, thus violating their rights to reproductive choice, like the one-child-per-family policy and coerced abortions in China.              

         To the contrary, a government offer of money is not coercion--and not even remotely comparable to what goes on in China. Existing benefits would not be reduced for anyone declining Norplant. This means that nobody who really wanted a child would be prevented from having one. To be sure, the government would be trying to influence reproductive choices. But the same is true of existing policies promoting free contraception, and of laws like the Hyde Amendment, which denies Medicaid funding for abortions--not to mention the still extant statutes making it a crime to commit statutory rape (sex with a consenting minor), fornication (premarital sex), and adultery. 

         In its groveling 1990 editorial apology, the Inquirer said: ""Our critics countered that to dangle cash or some other benefit in front of a desperately poor woman is tantamount to coercion. They're right."" No, they were wrong, and the Inquirer was right in its initial Norplant editorial, when it noted that women would be free to ""change their minds at any point and become fertile again."" 

         ""Many people,"" David Boldt, then-editor of the Inquirer's editorial page, noted in a subsequent commentary, ""saw the editorial as part of an ongoing white conspiracy to carry out genocide of blacks in America."" 

         This is pernicious nonsense, no matter how many people say it. The original Inquirer editorial unwittingly invited such smears by linking its Norplant proposal to race--specifically, to a report that nearly half the nation's black children are living in poverty. But nobody is proposing that race be a factor in any program promoting Norplant to welfare recipients, most of whom are white. Nobody is proposing to sterilize women or forbid them from having children. And while a disproportionate percentage of welfare mothers and children are black, black America, like white America, can only benefit from any program that rewards people for avoiding pregnancy unless and until they are old enough and self-supporting enough to provide decently for children. 

          G irls and women on Norplant may be at greater risk of contracting and spreading AIDS, because they will be less likely to demand that their sex partners use condoms.              

         A 1994 study reported in The New England Journal of Medicine found that Norplant had no effect on recipients' decisions whether to use condoms or visit doctors--and was 19 times as effective as the pill in preventing pregnancy. Any Norplant incentive program should include vigorous counseling about the need to use condoms against disease. But even now, how many women and girls are so much more afraid of pregnancy than of death that they use condoms solely to avoid the former, and would stop once on Norplant? Not many, I suspect. 

          N orplant itself may be unhealthy.              

         The possibility of serious long-term health damage from any relatively new contraceptive like Norplant must be taken seriously, and the risks should, of course, be fully disclosed to women considering using it. But no contraceptive is risk-free. And the available evidence indicates that the risks inherent in pregnancy and childbirth--and in abortion--are at least as great as the risks inherent in Norplant. 

         Plaintiffs' tort lawyers have nearly killed off Norplant, scaring away many women and doctors, by a torrent of personal-injury suits against its manufacturer. The lawyers include many of the same folks who created a tidal wave of litigation based on the apparently bogus claim about the dangers of silicone breast implants. But the Food and Drug Administration has repeatedly found Norplant to be safe and effective. More than a million women have used it with only minor side effects, such as changing menstrual bleeding patterns, reported. 

         There have been complaints by a small percentage of Norplant users of severe pain or scarring from having it removed. But the apparent reason was inadequate training of physicians in the (usually quick and painless) removal procedure--an easily remedied problem--and not any inherent defect in the product. 

          I t is sexist to seek to thrust contraception only upon women.              

         Sexism has nothing to do with it. First, almost all welfare checks are written to women--not to men, who don't get pregnant. Second, the only forms of contraception now available for men are condoms and vasectomies. It would hardly make sense to hand out $1,000 payments to men for taking home a bunch of condoms, or to try to police their use. And a vasectomy--unlike a Norplant implant-- cannot always be reversed. 

                         Giving teen-agers contraceptives encourages promiscuity, and bribing them to use Norplant will encourage it even more.              

         The weight of the evidence suggests that teen-agers' decisions whether or not to engage in sexual activity don't have much to do with whether the government gives them contraceptives. Many have unprotected sex, and almost all can get contraceptives if they want them. As I have suggested, one possible restriction (although not one I would favor) on any Norplant incentive program would be to limit eligibility to teen-agers who have already been pregnant or, at least, sexually active. Norplant counselors could also stress the benefits of abstinence, while presenting the contraceptive as a backup safeguard. 

          T een-agers should learn about sex and contraception from their parents, not the government.              

         A parental-consent requirement would answer this objection. I would not advocate such a requirement, however, because of the overwhelming evidence that many parents have little or no constructive communication with their children about such matters. I hope that my own two daughters (now 12 and nine years old) would consult with me and my wife before getting Norplant or becoming sexually active. But if they end up deciding to go their own ways, I'd rather that they have unrestricted access to Norplant than that they risk pregnancy. 

         Would a Norplant program be thwarted by the fact that many poor teen-agers actually want to get pregnant and have a child? I don't think so. First, there are about 3 million unwanted pregnancies in the United States every year, half of which end in abortion. Many of these involve teen-agers and women who are (or will be) on welfare. Norplant could stop almost all these. Second, the allure of pregnancy for many other poor teen-agers may be so slight, or so fleeting, or so fraught with ambivalence, that a $1,000 Norplant incentive would have plenty of takers. 

          And even if such a program only delayed pregnancies a few years, that would be a very good thing. Most 15-year-olds would be better mothers, and have a better chance of making something of their own lives, if they waited five or seven years before having babies. 

         Norplant is no panacea for poverty; nothing is. The question is whether a Norplant incentive program might do some good. There's only one way to find out: Give it a try. If it fails, the cost--in terms of numbers of teen-agers and women taking the $1,000 offer--will be tiny. And it just might help.

An enormous weapon is forcing people to keep
 
their troubles to themselves—it's dynamite!
Numb with the terror that had dogged him from the moment he regained
 consciousness and found himself naked and weaponless, Farrell had no
 idea how long he had been lost in the honeycombed darkness of the
 Hymenop dome.
The darkness and damp chill of air told him that he was far
 underground, possibly at the hive's lowest level. Somewhere above
 him, the silent audience chambers lay shrouded in lesser gloom, heavy
 with the dust of generations and peopled only by cryptic apian images.
 Outside the dome, in a bend of lazy silver river, sprawled the Sadr III
 village with its stoic handful of once-normal Terran colonists and, on
 the hillside above the village, Gibson and Stryker and Xavier would be
 waiting for him in the disabled
Marco Four.
Waiting for him....
They might as well have been back on Terra, five hundred light-years
 away.
Six feet away on either side, the corridor walls curved up faintly, a
 flattened oval of tunneling designed for multiple alien feet, lighted
 for faceted eyes demanding the merest fraction of light necessary
 for an Earthman's vision. For two yards Farrell could see dimly, as
 through a heavy fog; beyond was nothing but darkness and an outlandish
 labyrinth of cross-branching corridors that spiraled on forever without
 end.
Behind him, his pursuers—human natives or Hymenop invaders, he had
 no way of knowing which—drew nearer with a dry minor rustling whose
 suggestion of imminent danger sent Farrell plunging blindly on into the
 maze.
—To halt, sweating, when a sound exactly similar came to him from
 ahead.
It was what he had feared from the beginning. He could not go on, and
 he could not go back.
He made out the intersecting corridor to his right, then a vague oval
 opening that loomed faintly grayer than the wall about it. He darted
 into it as into a sanctuary, and realized too late that the choice had
 been forced upon him.
It had been intended from the start that he should take this way. He
 had been herded here like a halterless beast, driven by the steady
 threat of action never quite realized.
They
had known where he was
 going, and why.
But there was light down there somewhere at the end of the tunnel's
 aimless wanderings. If, once there, he could see—
He did not find light, only a lesser darkness. The tunnel led him
 into a larger place whose outer reaches were lost in shadow, but whose
 central area held a massive cylindrical machine at once alien and
 familiar.
He went toward it hesitantly, confused for the moment by a paramnesiac
 sense of repeated experience, the specious recognition of
déjà vu.
It was a Ringwave generator, and it was the thing he had ventured into
 the dome to find.
His confusion stemmed from its resemblance to the disabled generator
 aboard the
Marco Four,
and from the stereo-sharp associations it
 evoked: Gibson working over the ship's power plant, his black-browed
 face scowling and intent, square brown body moving with a wrestler's
 easy economy of motion; Stryker, bald and fat and worried, wheezing up
 and down the companionway from engine bay to chart room, his concern
 divided between Gibson's task and Farrell's long silence in the dome.
Stryker at this moment would be regretting the congenital optimism
 that had prompted him to send his navigator where he himself could
 not go. Sweating anxiety would have replaced Stryker's pontifical
 assurance, dried up his smug pattering of socio-psychological truisms
 lifted from the Colonial Reclamations Handbook....
""So far as adaptability is concerned,"" Stryker had said an eternal
 evening before, ""
homo sapiens
can be a pretty weird species. More
 given to mulish paradox, perhaps, than any alien life-form we're ever
 likely to run across out here.""


 He had shifted his bulk comfortably on the grass under the
Marco
 Four's
open port, undisturbed by the busy clatter of tools inside the
 ship where Gibson and Xavier, the
Marco's
mechanical, worked over
 the disabled power plant. He laced his fingers across his fat paunch
 and peered placidly through the dusk at Farrell, who lay on his back,
 smoking and watching the stars grow bright in the evening sky.


 ""Isolate a human colony from its parent planet for two centuries,
 enslave it for half that time to a hegemony as foreign as the
 Hymenops' hive-culture before abandoning it to its own devices, and
 anything at all in the way of eccentric social controls can develop.
 But men remain basically identical, Arthur, in spite of acquired
 superficial changes. They are inherently incapable of evolving any
 system of control mechanisms that cannot be understood by other men,
 provided the environmental circumstances that brought that system into
 being are known. At bottom, these Sadr III natives are no different
 from ourselves. Heredity won't permit it.""


 Farrell, half listening, had been staring upward between the icy white
 brilliance of Deneb and the twin blue-and-yellow jewels of Albireo,
 searching for a remote twinkle of Sol. Five hundred light-years away
 out there, he was thinking, lay Earth. And from Earth all this gaudy
 alien glory was no more than another point of reference for backyard
 astronomers, a minor configuration casually familiar and unremarkable.


 A winking of lighted windows springing up in the village downslope
 brought his attention back to the scattered cottages by the river, and
 to the great disquieting curve of the Hymenop dome that rose above them
 like a giant above pygmies. He sat up restlessly, the wind ruffling
 his hair and whirling the smoke of his cigarette away in thin flying
 spirals.


 ""You sound as smug as the Reorientation chapter you lifted that bit
 from,"" Farrell said. ""But it won't apply here, Lee. The same thing
 happened to these people that happened to the other colonists we've
 found, but they don't react the same. Either those Hymenop devils
 warped them permanently or they're a tribe of congenital maniacs.""


 Stryker prodded him socratically: ""Particulars?""


 ""When we crashed here five weeks ago, there were an even thousand
 natives in the village, plus or minus a few babes in arms. Since
 that time they've lost a hundred twenty-six members, all suicides or
 murders. At first the entire population turned out at sunrise and went
 into the dome for an hour before going to the fields; since we came,
 that period has shortened progressively to a few minutes. That much
 we've learned by observation. By direct traffic we've learned exactly
 nothing except that they can speak Terran Standard, but won't. What
 sort of system is that?""


 Stryker tugged uncomfortably at the rim of white hair the years had
 left him. ""It's a stumper for the moment, I'll admit ... if they'd
 only
talk
to us, if they'd tell us what their wants and fears and
 problems are, we'd know what is wrong and what to do about it. But
 controls forced on them by the Hymenops, or acquired since their
 liberation, seem to have altered their original ideology so radically
 that—""


 ""That they're plain batty,"" Farrell finished for him. ""The whole setup
 is unnatural, Lee. Consider this: We sent Xavier out to meet the first
 native that showed up, and the native talked to him. We heard it all by
 monitoring; his name was Tarvil, he spoke Terran Standard, and he was
 amicable. Then we showed ourselves, and when he saw that we were human
 beings like himself and not mechanicals like Xav, he clammed up. So did
 everyone in the village. It worries me, Lee. If they didn't expect men
 to come out of the
Marco
, then what in God's name
did
they expect?""


 He sat up restlessly and stubbed out his cigarette. ""It's an
 unimportant world anyway, all ocean except for this one small
 continent. I think we ought to write it off and get the hell out as
 soon as the
Marco
's Ringwave is repaired.""


 ""We can't write it off,"" Stryker said. ""Besides reclaiming a colony, we
 may have added a valuable marine food source to the Federation. Arthur,
 you're not letting a handful of disoriented people get under your
 skin, are you?""


 Farrell made an impatient sound and lit another cigarette. The brief
 flare of his lighter pierced the darkness and picked out a hurried
 movement a short stone's throw away, between the
Marco Four
and the
 village.
""There's one reason why I'm edgy,"" Farrell said. ""These Sadrians may
 be harmless, but they make a point of posting a guard over us. There's
 a sentry out there in the grass flats again tonight."" He turned on
 Stryker uneasily. ""I've watched on the infra-scanner while those
 sentries changed shifts, and they don't speak to each other. I've
 tracked them back to the village, but I've never seen one of them turn
 in a—""


 Down in the village a man screamed, a raw, tortured sound that brought
 both men up stiffly. A frantic drumming of running feet came to them,
 unmistakable across the little distance. The fleeing man came up from
 the dark huddle of cottages by the river and out across the grass
 flats, screaming.


 Pursuit overtook him halfway to the ship. There was a brief scuffling,
 a shadowy dispersal of silent figures. After that, nothing.


 ""They did it again,"" Farrell said. ""One of them tried to come up here
 to us. The others killed him, and who's to say what sort of twisted
 motive prompted them? They go to the dome together every morning, not
 speaking. They work all day in the fields without so much as looking at
 each other. But every night at least one of them tries to escape from
 the village and come up here—and this is what happens. We couldn't
 trust them, Lee, even if we could understand them!""


 ""It's our job to understand them,"" Stryker said doggedly. ""Our function
 is to find colonies disoriented by the Hymenops and to set them
 straight if we can. If we can't, we call in a long-term reorientation
 crew, and within three generations the culture will pass again for
 Terran. The fact that slave colonies invariably lose their knowledge of
 longevity helps; they don't get it back until they're ready for it.


 ""I've seen some pretty foul results of Hymenop experimenting
 on human colonies, Arthur. There was the ninth planet of Beta
 Pegasi—rediscovered in 3910, I think it was—that developed a
 religious fixation on fertility, a mania fostered by the Hymenops to
 supply expendable labor for their mines. The natives stopped mining
 when the Hymenops gave up the invasion and went back to 70 Ophiuchi,
 but they were still multiplying like rabbits when we found them. They
 followed a cultural conviction something like that observed in Oriental
 races of ancient Terran history, but they didn't pursue the Oriental
 tradition of sacrosancts. They couldn't—there were too many of them.
 By the time they were found, they numbered fourteen
billions
and they
 were eating each other. Still it took only three generations to set
 them straight.""


 He took one of Farrell's cigarettes and puffed it placidly.


 ""For that matter, Earth had her own share of eccentric cultures. I
 recall reading about one that existed as late as the twentieth century
 and equaled anything we're likely to find here. Any society should be
 geared to a set of social controls designed to furnish it, as a whole
 with a maximum of pleasure and a minimum of discomfort, but these
 ancient Terrestrial Dobuans—island aborigines, as I remember it—had
 adjusted to their total environment in a manner exactly opposite. They
 reversed the norm and became a society of paranoiacs, hating each
 other in direct ratio to nearness of relationship. Husbands and wives
 detested each other, sons and fathers—""


 ""Now you're pulling my leg,"" Farrell protested. ""A society like that
 would be too irrational to function.""


 ""But the system worked,"" Stryker insisted. ""It balanced well enough, as
 long as they were isolated. They accepted it because it was all they
 knew, and an abrupt reversal that negated their accustomed habits would
 create an impossible societal conflict. They were reoriented after
 the Fourth War, and succeeding generations adjusted to normal living
 without difficulty.""


 A sound from overhead made them look up. Gibson was standing in the
Marco's
open port.


 ""Conference,"" Gibson said in his heavy baritone, and went back inside.
They followed Gibson quickly and without question, more disturbed by
 the terse order than by the killing in the grass flats. Knowing Gibson,
 they realized that he would not have wasted even that one word unless
 emergency justified it.


 They found him waiting in the chart room with Xavier. For the
 thousandth time, seeing the two together, Farrell found himself
 comparing them: the robot, smoothly functional from flexible gray
 plastoid body to featureless oval faceplate, blandly efficient, totally
 incapable of emotion; Gibson, short and dark and competent heavy-browed
 and humorless. Except for initiative, Farrell thought, the two of them
 could have traded identities and no one would have been able to notice
 any difference.


 ""Xav and I found our Ringwave trouble,"" Gibson said. ""The generator is
 functioning, but the warp isn't going out. Something here on Sadr III
 is neutralizing it.""


 They stared at him as if he had just told them the planet was flat.


 ""But a Ringwave can't be stopped completely, once it is started,""
 Stryker protested. ""You'd have to dismantle it to shut it off, Gib!""


 ""The warping field can be damped out, though,"" Gibson said. ""Adjacent
 generators operating at different phase levels will heterodyne at a
 frequency representing the mean variance between levels. The resulting
 beat-phase will be too low to maintain either field, and one or the
 other, or both, will blank out. If you remember, all Terran-designed
 power plants are set to the same phase for that reason.""


 ""But these natives
can't
have a Ringwave plant!"" Farrell argued.
 ""There's only this one village on Sadr III, Gib, an insignificant
 little agrarian township! If they had the Ringwave, they'd be
 mechanized. They'd have vehicles, landing ports....""


 ""The Hymenops had the Ringwave,"" Gibson interrupted. ""And they left the
 dome down there, the first undamaged one we've found. Figure it out for
 yourselves.""


 They digested the statement in silence. Stryker paled slowly, as if
 it needed time for apprehension to work its way through his fat bulk.
 Farrell's uneasiness, sourceless until now, grew to chill certainty.
""I think I've expected this, without realizing it, since my first
 flight,"" he said. ""It stood to reason that the Hymenops would quit
 running somewhere, that we'd bump into them eventually out here on the
 fringes. Twenty thousand light-years back to 70 Ophiuchi is a long way
 to retreat.... Gib, do you think they're still here?""


 Gibson did not shrug, but his voice seemed to. ""It won't matter one way
 or the other unless we can clear the
Marco's
generator.""


 From another man it might have been irony. Knowing Gibson, Farrell and
 Stryker accepted it as a bald statement of fact.


 ""Then we're up against a Hymenop hive-mind,"" Stryker said. ""And we
 can't run away from it. Any suggestions?""


 ""We'll have to find the interfering generator and stop it,"" Farrell
 offered, knowing that was the only obvious solution.


 ""One alternative,"" Gibson corrected. ""If we can determine what
 phase-level the interfering warp uses, we may be able to adjust the
Marco's
generator to match it. Once they're in resonance, they won't
 interfere."" He caught Stryker's unspoken question and answered it. ""It
 would take a week. Maybe longer.""


 Stryker vetoed the alternative. ""Too long. If there are Hymenops here,
 they won't give us that much time.""


 Farrell switched on the chart room scanning screen and centered it
 on the village downslope. Scattered cottages with dark tiled roofs
 and lamp-bright windows showed up clearly. Out of their undisciplined
 grouping swept the great hemispherical curve of the dome, glinting
 dully metallic in the starshine.


 ""Maybe we're jumping to conclusions,"" he said. ""We've been here for
 five weeks without seeing a trace of Hymenops, and from what I've read
 of them, they'd have jumped us the minute we landed. Chances are that
 they left Sadr III in too great a hurry to wreck the dome, and their
 Ringwave power plant is still running.""


 ""You may be right,"" Stryker said, brightening. ""They carried the fight
 to us from the first skirmish, two hundred years ago, and they damned
 near beat us before we learned how to fight them.""


 He looked at Xavier's silent plastoid figure with something like
 affection. ""We'd have lost that war without Xave's kind. We
 couldn't match wits with Hymenop hive-minds, any more than a swarm
 of grasshoppers could stand up to a colony of wasps. But we made
 mechanicals that could. Cybernetic brains and servo-crews, ships that
 thought for themselves....""


 He squinted at the visiscreen with its cryptic, star-streaked dome.
 ""But they don't think as we do. They may have left a rear guard here,
 or they may have boobytrapped the dome.""


 ""One of us will have to find out which it is,"" Farrell said. He took
 a restless turn about the chart room, weighing the probabilities. ""It
 seems to fall in my department.""


 Stryker stared. ""You? Why?""


 ""Because I'm the only one who
can
go. Remember what Gib said about
 changing the
Marco's
Ringwave to resonate with the interfering
 generator? Gib can make the change; I can't. You're—""


 ""Too old and fat,"" Stryker finished for him. ""And too damned slow and
 garrulous. You're right, of course.""


 They let it go at that and put Xavier on guard for the night. The
 mechanical was infinitely more alert and sensitive to approach than any
 of the crew, but the knowledge did not make Farrell's sleep the sounder.


 He dozed fitfully, waking a dozen times during the night to smoke
 cigarettes and to speculate fruitlessly on what he might find in the
 dome. He was sweating out a nightmare made hideous by monstrous bees
 that threatened him in buzzing alien voices when Xavier's polite
 monotone woke him for breakfast.
Farrell was halfway down the grassy slope to the village when he
 realized that the
Marco
was still under watch. Approaching close
 enough for recognition, he saw that the sentry this time was Tarvil,
 the Sadrian who had first approached the ship. The native's glance took
 in Farrell's shoulder-pack of testing tools and audiphone, brushed the
 hand-torch and blast gun at the Terran's belt, and slid away without
 trace of expression.


 ""I'm going into the dome,"" Farrell said. He tried to keep the
 uncertainty out of his voice, and felt a rasp of irritation when he
 failed. ""Is there a taboo against that?""


 The native fell in beside him without speaking and they went down
 together, walking a careful ten feet apart, through dew-drenched grass
 flats that gleamed like fields of diamonds under the early morning sun.
 From the village, as they approached, straggled the inevitable exodus
 of adults and half-grown children, moving silently out to the fields.


 ""Weird beggars,"" Farrell said into his audiphone button. ""They don't
 even rub elbows at work. You'd think they were afraid of being
 contaminated.""


 Stryker's voice came tinnily in his ear. ""They won't seem so strange
 once we learn their motivations. I'm beginning to think this
 aloofness of theirs is a religious concomitant, Arthur, a hangover
 from slave-controls designed to prevent rebellion through isolation.
 Considering what they must have suffered under the Hymenops, it's a
 wonder they're even sane.""


 ""I'll grant the religious origin,"" Farrell said. ""But I wouldn't risk a
 centicredit on their sanity. I think the lot of them are nuts.""


 The village was not deserted, but so far as Farrell's coming was
 concerned, it might as well have been. The few women and children he
 saw on the streets ignored him—and Tarvil—completely.


 He met with only one sign of interest, when a naked boy perhaps six
 years old stared curiously and asked something in a childish treble of
 the woman accompanying him. The woman answered with a single sharp
 word and struck the child across the face, sending him sprawling.


 Farrell relayed the incident. ""She said '
Quiet!
' and slapped him
 down, Lee. They start their training early.""


 ""Their sort of indifference couldn't be congenital,"" Stryker said. His
 tinny murmur took on a puzzled sound. ""But they've been free for four
 generations. It's hard to believe that any forcibly implanted control
 mechanism could remain in effect so long.""


 A shadow blocked the sun, bringing a faint chill to Farrell when he
 looked up to see the great rounded hump of the dome looming over him.


 ""I'm going into the dome now,"" he said. ""It's like all the others—no
 openings except at ground level, where it's riddled with them.""


 Tarvil did not accompany him inside. Farrell, looking back as he
 thumbed his hand-torch alight in the nearest entranceway, saw the
 native squatting on his heels and looking after him without a single
 trace of interest.
""I'm at ground level,"" Farrell said later, ""in what seems to have
 been a storage section. Empty now, with dust everywhere except in the
 corridors the natives use when they come in, mornings. No sign of
 Hymenops yet.""


 Stryker's voice turned worried. ""Look sharp for traps, Arthur. The
 place may be mined.""


 The upper part of the dome, Farrell knew from previous experience,
 would have been given over in years past to Hymenop occupation, layer
 after rising layer of dormitories tiered like honeycombs to conserve
 space. He followed a spiral ramp downward to the level immediately
 below surface, and felt his first excitement of discovery when he found
 himself in the audience chambers that, until the
Marco's
coming, had
 been the daily goal of the Sadrian natives.


 The level was entirely taken up with bare ten-foot cubicles, each
 cramped chamber dominated by a cryptic metal-and-crystal likeness
 of the Hymenop head set into the metal wall opposite its corridor
 entrance. From either side of a circular speaking-grill, the antennae
 projected into the room, rasplike and alert, above faceted crystal
 eyes that glowed faintly in the near-darkness. The craftsmanship was
 faultless, stylized after a fashion alien to Farrell's imagining and
 personifying with disturbing realism the soulless, arrogant efficiency
 of the Hymenop hive-mind. To Farrell, there was about each image a
 brooding air of hypnotic fixity.


 ""Something new in Hymenop experiments,"" he reported to Stryker. ""None
 of the other domes we found had anything like this. These things have
 some bearing on the condition of the natives, Lee—there's a path worn
 through the dust to every image, and I can see where the people knelt.
 I don't like it. I've got a hunch that whatever these damned idols were
 used for succeeded too well.""


 ""They can't be idols,"" Stryker said. ""The Hymenops would have known how
 hard it is to displace anthropomorphism entirely from human worship.
 But I think you're right about the experiment's working too well. No
 ordinary compulsion would have stuck so long. Periodic hypnosis? Wait,
 Arthur, that's an angle I want to check with Gibson....""


 He was back a moment later, wheezing with excitement.


 ""Gib thinks I'm on the right track—periodic hypnosis. The Hymenops
 must have assigned a particular chamber and image to each slave. The
 images are mechanicals, robot mesmerists designed to keep the natives'
 compulsion-to-isolation renewed. Post-hypnotic suggestion kept the
 poor devils coming back every morning, and their children with them,
 even after the Hymenops pulled out. They couldn't break away until
 the
Marco's
Ringwave forced a shutdown of the dome's power plant
 and deactivated the images. Not that they're any better off now that
 they're free; they don't know how—""


 Farrell never heard the rest of it. Something struck him sharply across
 the back of the head.
When he regained consciousness, he was naked and weaponless and lost.
 The rustling of approach, bodiless and dreadful in darkness, panicked
 him completely and sent him fleeing through a sweating eternity that
 brought him finally to the dome's lowest level and the Hymenop power
 plant.


 He went hesitantly toward the shadowy bulk of the Ringwave cylinder,
 drawn as much now by its familiarity as driven by the terror behind
 him. At the base of the towering machine, he made out a control board
 totally unrecognizable in design, studded with dials and switches
 clearly intended for alien handling.


 The tinny whispering of Stryker's voice in the vaultlike quiet struck
 him with the frightening feeling that he had gone mad.


 He saw his equipment pack then, lying undamaged at the foot of the
 control board. Stryker's voice murmured from its audicom unit: ""We're
 in the dome, Arthur. Where are you? What level—""


 Farrell caught up the audicom, swept by a sudden wild lift of hope.
 ""I'm at the bottom of the dome, in the Ringwave chamber. They took my
 gun and torch. For God's sake, hurry!""


 The darkness gave up a furtive scuffling of sandaled feet, the tight
 breathing of many men. Someone made a whimpering sound, doglike and
 piteous; a Sadrian voice hissed sharply, ""
Quiet!
""


 Stryker's metallic whisper said: ""We're tracking your carrier, Arthur.
 Use the tools they left you. They brought you there to repair the
 Ringwave, to give back the power that kept their images going. Keep
 busy!""


 Farrell, only half understanding, took up his instrument case. His
 movement triggered a tense rustle in the darkness; the voice whimpered
 again, a tortured sound that rasped Farrell's nerves like a file on
 glass.


 ""
Give me back my Voice. I am alone and afraid. I must have
 Counsel....
""


 Beneath the crying, Farrell felt the terror, incredibly voiced, that
 weighted the darkness, the horror implicit in stilled breathing, the
 swelling sense of outrage.


 There was a soft rush of bodies, a panting and struggling. The
 whimpering stopped.


 The instrument case slipped out of Farrell's hands. On the heels of its
 nerve-shattering crash against the metal floor came Stryker's voice,
 stronger as it came closer.


 ""Steady, Arthur. They'll kill you if you make a scene. We're coming,
 Gib and Xav and I. Don't lose your head!""


 Farrell crouched back against the cold curve of the Ringwave cylinder,
 straining against flight with an effort that left him trembling
 uncontrollably. A spasm of incipient screaming seized his throat and
 he bit it back savagely, stifling a terror that could not be seen,
 grasped, fought with.


 He was giving way slowly when Xavier's inflectionless voice droned out
 of the darkness: ""Quiet. Your Counsel will be restored.""


 There was a sudden flood of light, unbearable after long darkness.
 Farrell had a failing glimpse of Gibson, square face blocked with light
 and shadow from the actinic flare overhead, racing toward him through a
 silently dispersing throng of Sadrians.


 Then he passed out.
He was strapped to his couch in the chart room when he awoke. The
Marco Four
was already in space; on the visiscreen, Farrell could
 see a dwindling crescent of Sadr III, and behind it, in the black pit
 of space, the fiery white eye of Deneb and the pyrotechnic glowing of
 Albireo's blue-and-yellow twins.


 ""We're headed out,"" he said, bewildered. ""What happened?""


 Stryker came over and unstrapped him. Gibson, playing chess with Xavier
 across the chart-room plotting table, looked up briefly and went back
 to his gambit.


 ""We reset the Ringwave in the dome to phase with ours and lugged you
 out,"" Stryker explained genially. He was back in character again, his
 fat paunch quivering with the beginning of laughter. ""We're through
 here. The rest is up to Reorientation.""


 Farrell gaped at him. ""You're giving up on Sadr III?""


 ""We've done all we can. Those Sadrians need something that a
 preliminary expedition like ours can't give them. Right now they are
 willing victims of a rigid religious code that makes it impossible for
 any one of them to express his wants, hopes, ideals or misfortunes to
 another. Exchanging confidences, to them, is the ultimate sacrilege.""


 ""Then they
are
crazy. They'd have to be, with no more opportunity for
 emotional catharsis than that!""


 ""They're not insane, they're—adapted. Those robot images you found
 are everything to this culture: arbiters, commercial agents, monitors
 and confessors all in one. They not only relay physical needs from one
 native to another; they listen to all problems and give solutions.
 They're
Counselors
, remember? Man's gregariousness stems largely from
 his need to unload his troubles on someone else. The Hymenops came up
 with an efficient substitute here, and the natives accepted it as the
 norm.""


 Farrell winced with sudden understanding. ""No wonder the poor devils
 cracked up right and left. With their Ringwave dead, they might as well
 have been struck blind and dumb! They couldn't even get together among
 themselves to figure a way out.""


 ""There you have it,"" Stryker said. ""They knew we were responsible for
 their catastrophe, but they couldn't bring themselves to ask us for
 help because we were human beings like themselves. So they went mad one
 by one and committed the ultimate blasphemy of shouting their misery in
 public, and their fellows had to kill them or countenance sacrilege.
 But they'll quiet down now. They should be easy enough to handle by the
 time the Reorientation lads arrive.""


 He began to chuckle. ""We left their Counselors running, but we
 disconnected the hypnosis-renewal circuits. They'll get only what
 they need from now on, which is an outlet for shifting their personal
 burdens. And with the post-hypnotic compulsion gone, they'll turn to
 closer association with each other. Human gregariousness will reassert
 itself. After a couple of generations, the Reorientation boys can write
 them off as Terran Normal and move on to the next planetary madhouse
 we've dug up for them.""


 Farrell said wonderingly, ""I never thought of the need to exchange
 confidences as being so important. But it is; everyone does it. You and
 I often talk over personal concerns, and Gib—""


 He broke off to study the intent pair at the chessboard, comparing
 Gibson's calm selfsufficiency to the mechanical's bland competence.


 ""There's an exception for your theory, Lee. Iron Man Gibson never gave
 out with a confidence in his life!""


 Stryker laughed. ""You may be right. How about it, Gib? Do you ever feel
 the need of a wailing wall?""


 Gibson looked up briefly from his game, his square face unsurprised.


 ""Well, sure. Why not? I tell my troubles to Xavier.""


 When they looked at each other blankly, he added, with the nearest
 approach to humor that either Farrell or Stryker had ever seen in him:
 ""It's a reciprocal arrangement. Xav confides his to me.""

         Back when I was a journalist--before I became a provider of digital content--I thought life would always be simple: I would write articles, and people would pay to read them. But then I heard about the impending death of intellectual property, a scenario painted by cyberfuturists John Perry Barlow and Esther Dyson. As all media move online, they say, content will be so freely available that getting paid to produce it will be hard, if not impossible. At first, I dismissed this as garden-variety, breathless overextrapolation from digerati social theorists. But even as I scoffed, the Barlow-Dyson scenario climbed steadily toward the rank of conventional wisdom. 

         Barlow and Dyson do have a solution. In the future people like me, having cultivated a following by providing free content on the Web, will charge our devotees for services that are hard to replicate en masse. We will answer individual questions online, say, or go around giving speeches, or spew out insights at private seminars, or (this one is actually my idea) have sex with young readers. The key, writes Barlow, will be not content but ""performance."" Barlow, a former lyricist for the Grateful Dead, offers this analogy: The Dead let people tape concerts, and the tapes then led more people to pay for the concerts. 

         The seminal version of the Barlow-Dyson thesis is Barlow's 10,000-word 1994 essay in Wired . It is with some trepidation that I challenge the logic of this argument. Barlow is a noted visionary, and he is famously derisive of people less insightful than himself (a group which, in his opinion, includes roughly everyone). He says, for example, that the ability of courts to deal correctly with cyberissues depends on the ""depth of the presiding judge's clue-impairment."" Well, at the risk of joining Barlow's long roster of the clue-impaired, here goes. 

         Barlow's argument begins with a cosmic premise: ""Digital technology is detaching information from the physical plane, where property law of all sorts has always found definition."" This is wrong on two counts. First, all information does take physical form. Whether digital or analog, whether in ink or sound waves or synaptic firings or electrons, information always resides in patterns of matter or energy (which, as Einstein noted, are interchangeable manifestations of the physical world). 

         To be sure, the significance of information is independent of its particular physical incarnation. So is its value. You download this article from Slate's servers and copy it onto your own hard disk, and it's still worth--well, nothing, but that's a . Suppose it were a Madonna video: You'd get just as much enjoyment out of it regardless of which particular bunch of electrons embodied it. 

          

            B &gt;ut this independence of meaning and value from physical incarnation is nothing new. It is as old as Sumerian tablets, to say nothing of the Gutenberg press. Indeed, the whole reason intellectual-property law exists is that people can acquire your information without acquiring the particular physical version of it that you created. Thus Barlow's belief that ""property law of all sorts"" has always ""found definition"" on the ""physical plane"" signals a distressing confusion on his part. The one sense in which it's true that information is ""detached"" from the ""physical plane""--the fact that information's value transcends its physical incarnation--not only fails to qualify as an original insight, and not only fails to make intellectual-property rights obsolete; it's the very insight that led to intellectual-property rights in the first place! Barlow announces from the mountaintop: ""It's fairly paradigm warping to look at information through fresh eyes--to see how very little it is like pig iron or pork bellies."" Maybe so, but it's hard to say for sure, since the people who really did take that fresh look have been dead for centuries. 

         If you somehow forced Barlow to articulate his thesis without the wacky metaphysics, he'd probably say something like this: The cost of copying and distributing information is plummeting--for many purposes, even approaching zero. Millions of people can now do it right at their desks. So in principle, content can multiply like fruit flies. Why should anyone buy an article when a copy can be had for nothing? 

         Answer: Because it can't. The total cost of acquiring a ""free"" copy includes more than just the copying-and-transmitting costs. There's 1) the cost--in time and/or money--of finding someone who already has a copy, and will give it to you for free or for cheap; 2) the risk of getting caught stealing intellectual property; 3) any premiums you pay to others for incurring such risks (as when you get copies from bootleggers); and 4) informal punishments such as being labeled a cheat or a cheapskate. The size of this last cost will depend on how norms in this area evolve. 

         Even in the distant future, the total cost of cheating on the system, thus figured, will almost never be zero. Yes, it will be way, way closer to zero than it used to be. But the Barlow-Dyson scenario still is wrong. Why? Because whether people cheat doesn't depend on the absolute cost of cheating. It depends on the cost of cheating compared with the cost of not cheating. And the cost of getting data legally will plummet roughly as fast as the cost of getting it illegally--maybe faster.              

         In their writings, Barlow and Dyson make clear they're aware of this fact. But they seems unaware of its fatal impact on their larger thesis. How could cybersages have such a blind spot? One theory: Because they're cyber sages. You have to be a career paleohack like me, getting paid for putting ink on paper, to appreciate how much of the cost of legally acquiring bits of information goes into the ink and paper and allied anachronisms, like shipping, warehousing, and displaying the inky paper. I wrote a book that costs $14 in paperback. For each copy sold, I get $1. The day may well come, as Barlow and Dyson seem to believe, when book publishers as we know them will disappear. People will download books from Web sites and either print them out on new, cool printers or read them on superlight wireless computers. But if so, it will then cost you only $1--oh hell, make it $1.25--to get a copy of my book legally from my Web site. 

         Now imagine being at my Web site, reading my promotional materials, and deciding you'd like to read the book. (Thank you.) A single keystroke will give you the book, drain your bank account of five shiny quarters, and leave you feeling like an honest, upstanding citizen. Do you think you'll choose, instead, to call a few friends in hopes of scoring an illegal copy? And don't imagine that you can just traipse on over to the ""black-market book store"" section of the Web and find a hot copy of my book. As in the regular world, the easier it is for Joe Consumer to track down an illegal distributor, the easier it is for cops to do the same. Black marketeers will have to charge enough to make up for this risk, making it hard to undersell my $1.25 by much. And there are , too, why the cost of cheating will be nontrivial. 

          

            M &gt;eanwhile, on the other side of the ledger, there's another reason for the cost of legal copies to drop. Many journalists will reach a much larger audience on the Web than they do now. The ""magazine"" model of bringing information to the attention of readers is stunningly inefficient. I hope it's not egotistical of me to think that when I write an article for, say, the New                 Republic , I am not reaching nearly everyone who might have an interest in it. Granted, the Web is not yet a picture of efficiency itself. Search engines, for example, are in the reptilian phase of their evolution. But most observers--certainly the Barlows of the world--expect radical improvement. (I'm not saying all journalists will see their audiences grow. The likely trend, when you , will be for many obscure and semiobscure journalists to see their audiences grow, while the few rich and famous journalists will see their audiences shrink. Cool.) 

         One much-discussed cybertrend is especially relevant here: the scenario in which various data brokers offer a ""Daily Me,"" a batch of articles tailored to your tastes, cheaply gleaned from all over the Web. When this happens, guys like me will be living the life of Riley. We will wake up at noon, stumble over to the keyboard in our pajamas, hammer out 1,000 words, and then--without talking to a single bothersome editor--make our work available to all data brokers. Likely fans of my article will be shown, say, the first couple of paragraphs. If they want to read more, they deposit a quarter. Will you try to steal a copy instead? Do you steal Tootsie pops at checkout counters? The broker and the electronic cash service will pocket a dime of that. I take my 15 cents and head for the liquor store. 

         Of course, this ""disaggregation of content"" may be ruinous for magazines like Slate. But consider the upside. Not only will the efficiency of the system permit rock-bottom pricing that discourages cheating, but the fluidity of content will disrupt channels of potential cheating. If you subscribe to a regular, old-fashioned online magazine, it's easy to split the cost of a subscription with a few friends and furtively make copies. (You wretched scum.) But if you subscribe to the ""Daily Me,"" this arrangement makes no sense, because every Me is different. Sure, you may e-mail a friend the occasional article from your ""Me."" (You wretched scum.) And, in general, this sort of ""leakage"" will be higher than in pre-Web days. But it would have to reach massive proportions to negate the overall gains in efficiency that will keep people like me in business. 

         This argument, like all arguments about the future, is speculative. It may even be wrong. But it is consistent with the history of the world. The last half-millennium has seen 1) data getting cheaper and easier to copy; and 2) data-creation occupying a larger and larger fraction of all economic activity. Thus far, in other words, as the realm of information has gotten more lubricated, it has become easier , not harder, to make a living by generating information. Cyberspace is essentially a quantum leap in lubrication. 

         Barlow's insistence that intellectual property will soon be worthless is especially puzzling since he is one of the biggest troubadours of the Third Wave information economy. Sometimes he seem to think it's possible for a sector of a market economy to get bigger and bigger even while the connection between work and reward in that sector breaks down. He writes: ""Humanity now seems bent on creating a world economy primarily based on goods that take no material form. In doing so, we may be eliminating any predictable connection between creators and a fair reward for the utility or pleasure others may find in their works."" Far out, man.

At the end of August, as the northern hemisphere's hottest summer on record drew to a close, a group of inventors, designers and engineers assembled in a grand stone castle an hour's drive west of Paris. Château de Millemont was hosting a five-week 'innovation camp' for the pioneers behind 12 new projects, chosen for their contribution to achieving a world without fossil fuels. POC21 (Proof of Concept) was set up as an active, grassroots foil to cop 21, the 21st UN Climate Change conference in Paris, which begins at the end of November.  

 ""Global emissions have doubled since the first UN climate summit in 1995,"" says the POC21 video, amid images of environmental catastrophe, so ""Let's move from talking to building a better tomorrow."" The objective was to create workable open-source technology in the fields of energy, food and waste – life, basically.  

 Products that made it to the final 12 included a pedal tractor, a smartphone-controlled greenhouse and an antibacterial water filter. Daniel Connell, one of the chosen inventors, travelled to Paris from the UK for the event. He was picked because he'd created an impressive cost- and resource-efficient wind turbine design. You can make it for about £20 out of aluminium sheets, a bike wheel, rivets, washers and nuts and bolts.  

 ""It's entirely built from recycled or upcycled materials, and can be assembled by anybody with basic hand or power tools,"" says Dominik Wind, core organiser of POC21. ""While this makes his design a perfect fit for the people that need it most (the poor, the marginalised around the globe), it's also the perfect design to build upon: it's the basis to start from with more customised, possibly also more complex and more expensive iterations.""  

 Connell has been creating prototype technologies and tutorials for solar and wind designs while moving around the world over the last 10 years, traversing Canada, France, India and Spain. A 3D animator by trade, he is self-taught – he describes the Solar Flower, a DIY solar energy collector he created, as ""my degree"" – and set out to make an existing design for a wind turbine cheap and easy for people to use. ""Technically, it could be $5 if you just pay for the rivets and get plates and a bike wheel for free,"" he said.  

 A seasoned squatter, Connell made his project possible by sifting through scrap heaps, fixing up bikes and living on a few pounds a day so he wouldn't have to work and could devote his time to the wind turbine. Connell's ethos is inspired by the self-sufficient communities he grew up in as a child in New Zealand, and that country's culture of ingenuity and making stuff. Since POC21, his product has improved and he's showing it to students, retirees and other people who want to get off grid via workshops.  

 Connell is one of a number of green inventors working to ease the world's transition to climate change. As wildfires spread, countries sink, species go extinct, floods and drought increase, seas rise, storms devastate, glaciers melt, crops fail, pollution decreases life expectancy and the potential for conflict grows, eyes look to the inventors, geniuses and entrepreneurs who surely can figure out a way of saving the planet.  

 When Pope Francis, in an unprecedented speech earlier this year, rejected market solutions for climate change, attacked ""unfettered capitalism"" and made a forceful moral plea, it raised the question: if individual behavioural changes aren't realistic or enough, can't technology provide a route out of the problem? Where is that technology? And is 'techno-utopianism' realistic in the context of the climate crisis?
Major companies are already divesting from fossil fuels – most recently the Rockefeller Foundation, the Church of England and Norway's £900bn sovereign wealth fund – as burnable reserves run out and the climate change threat becomes more apparent; but local attention is also turning to how to transition to a greener world.  

In the bowels of an east London theatre on a foggy Sunday afternoon a month or so after POC21, a panel discusses whether Hackney Council should divest its pensions away from fossil fuels. ""There is an energy transition happening,"" says Carbon Tracker's Luke Sussams. Dr David McCoy, an expert in global public health, says, ""We face an existential threat in terms of eco collapse… My 14-year-old daughter's future does not look good."" He explains how global warming will affect disease patterns and prompt conflict over scarce resources. Yet there is some optimism about green developments in electric cars, renewable energies and Tesla's new battery technology.  

 Bill McKibben, the campaigner and author who brought global warming to public consciousness with his 1989 book The End of Nature, and more recently the founder of international pressure group 350.org, is positive and excited about innovation in the green world. ""The price of a solar panel dropped 75 per cent in the last six years,"" he said, speaking from his home in Vermont. ""The world's engineers are doing their job; and doing it extraordinarily well.""  

 The move to renewable energy is under way. An Apollo-style research programme to make renewable energy cheaper than fossil fuels recently won the backing of Sir David Attenborough and high-profile businesspeople, politicians and economists. Even Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, has warned that the ""vast majority of reserves are unburnable"" if global temperature rises are to be limited to below 2C. But others think that it's not enough, and consider geoengineering to be the grand techno-fix.  

 First presented as a big-idea solution to climate change in the 1960s, geoengineering proposals range from the seemingly fantastical – brightening the clouds; stirring the seas to change their temperature and cool the Earth; turning the ocean into a gigantic bubble bath to reflect the sun; covering the deserts in mirrors and sending parasols into space; mimicking the cooling effects of volcanic eruptions like Mount Pinatubo – to the more mundane: removing carbon from atmosphere and storing it somewhere else.  

 Although a number of scientists and researchers – including the Royal Society, which held a geoengineering 'retreat' in Buckinghamshire in 2011 – think geoengineering is an option worth considering, no one is actually doing it yet. Well, apart from Russ George, the businessman, entrepreneur and ""DIY rogue geo-vigilante"" who dumped 100 tonnes of iron sulphate into the Pacific ocean, triggering a 10,000-sq-km plankton bloom (plankton blooms suck carbon out of the atmosphere). Though the efficacy of his actions is still unclear, George was criticised for eco-terrorism, and was said to have contravened UN conventions.  

The big problem with DIY geoengineering, and any geoengineering for that matter, is its potential for danger: we don't know what would happen. David Keith, a professor of engineering at Harvard who developed a giant air-sucking wall to capture carbon, told the New Yorker's Michael Specter, ""It is hyperbolic to say this, but no less true: when you start to reflect light away from the planet, you can easily imagine a chain of events that would extinguish life on Earth.""  

 On the other hand, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) doesn't seem, on the face of it, like playing god with our weather systems or trying, fruitlessly, to find a dimmer switch for the sun. A company called Skyonics claims its Skymine process can capture harmful pollutants and turn them into marketable products such as baking soda and bleach.  

 But to what extent can sucking carbon out of the air work? Sabine Mathesius, a climate modeller at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, wanted to see what CDR could achieve if five gigatons (an enormous, hypothetical amount) of carbon dioxide was removed from the atmosphere each year. Simulations found that the impact of this level of removal would not be significant at all, especially in terms of protecting the ocean, which is acidified by human-produced CO2.  

 ""In the beginning I was surprised,"" she said. ""Like many people I also hoped that geoengineering could be a way to undo the harm we did with our CO2 emissions. But if you see how much CO2 we can get out of the atmosphere with the current technologies and what we are expected to emit in a business-as-usual scenario, you can already see that the impact of CO2 removal cannot be that big.""  

 CDR could be used as a supporting measure to avoid the worst scenario if emissions are reduced at the same time, Mathesius concluded. ""What is not possible is just emitting the CO2 as usual and further expanding our industries and then using CDR to get the CO2 out of the atmosphere. Reducing emissions is the cheapest way to keep the CO2 levels low; and also the easiest way."" More promising technologies, such as bioenergy with carbon capture or artificial trees, would also require fertile land or would cost astronomic amounts, Mathesius says. So where then would she place her hope in terms of a techno-fix to solve climate change? ""Clean energy to make it easier for people to emit less CO2.""  

 Carbon capture and storage gets short shrift from McKibben. ""If you step back and think about it for a minute, it's silly,"" he says. ""You can do it, obviously, but can you do it at a cost that makes any kind of sense? You can't. No one's been able to yet. You're way better off just building the windmills in the first place. All it is is a solution designed to try and appease the power of the coal industry and offer them some kind of future.""  

 Those looking into this techno-fix are quite clear that solar radiation management or carbon capture is no substitute for reducing carbon emissions anyway. Bodies such as the Solar Radiation Management Governance Initiative (SRMGI) and the Royal Society contain wary caveats, that geoengineering is not an alternative to reducing carbon consumption. McKibben calls them an ""absurd set of ideas where people throw up their hands and say, 'There's no way we can solve this problem, so instead let's fill the atmosphere with sulphur'.""
On the last day of April, Elon Musk entered the stage at his Tesla Design Centre in Hawthorne, California to thumping dubstep, whoops and ripples of applause. The billionaire business magnate nodded to the crowd of adoring fans and set out his vision for a complete transformation of how the world works. His 20-minute speech explained how a new invention – the Powerwall battery – would advance a complete overhaul of the world's energy infrastructure. ""This is how it is today… it sucks,"" Musk began, gesturing to slides depicting factories belching out smoke.  

 The solution to getting from fossil fuel hell to a renewable-powered future, he explained, was his new product. Because ""existing batteries suck,"" he had developed the Tesla Powerwall: a wall-mounted, household battery on sale for $3,500 (£2,300). His statements were punctuated by cheers and screams from the crowd, especially when he revealed that the whole event had been powered by solar and Powerwall.  

 Musk believes that transitioning to electric cars and solar energy will contain the worst effects of climate change. His electric cars are improving all the time; the mass-market model is expected to be ready before 2020. Tesla open-sourced all its patents and technology in 2014 to encourage other people to advance the electric vehicle industry; and lots of major names in the automobile world have followed with designs for electric cars. ""We need the entire automotive industry to remake, and quickly,"" said McKibben. Musk has also proposed the Hyperloop, a new transport system he describes as ""a cross between Concorde, a railgun and a hockey table"".  

 Advances in batteries radically change the picture of renewable energy, electric cars and transport systems; and important improvements are happening. At the end of October 2015, a group of Cambridge scientists made a major breakthrough with a rechargeable super-battery that can hold five times more energy as those we're used to and can power a car from London to Edinburgh on a single charge.  

 Improved battery storage will change everything for green energy enthusiasts like Daniel Connell in the next few years. ""This is why, apart from [a lack of] political will, we don't have renewable energy: because storage levels don't reach grid level. But before the end of the decade they will,"" he explains.
One of the projects chosen for POC21, the French eco-castle retreat, was a design by a team from Berlin. Sunzilla, a diesel generator without diesel, fuelled by the sun, can be assembled by anyone. Germany is leading the way in the energy revolution with its
energiewende
, driven by Green politicians and the support of local citizens. In 2014, just over a quarter of German energy came from renewable sources; in 2050, the goal is 80 per cent. The German Green Party politician Ralf Fücks, author of a new book called Green Growth, Smart Growth, is a techno-optimist with faith in society's ability to find a way out of the ecological crisis, although he cautions against the hubris of large-scale techno-fixes. Investment in green technologies and renewable energies are more realistic, he writes, than carbon capture and storage.  

 Fücks speak slowly, carefully and with an obvious delight in the natural world. ""Spider silk is a wonderful substance,"" he says at one point. ""It's more flexible than rubber and more solid than steel and we now have the skills to discover [its] molecular composition."" He cites the smooth skin of the shark and the self-cleaning surface of the lotus blossom as examples of biological productivity we can learn from and use for our own purposes, while decreasing CO2 emissions.  

 But biomimicry is in its early stages, and renewables have already crossed to the point of no return, as Fücks puts it. On the plus side, though, costs for solar and wind power have decreased considerably over the last five years.  

 Fücks sees opportunities for young entrepreneurs and startups in a world without global celebrities such as Bill Gates or Richard Branson. The environmental reform of industrial society, in his view, demands a combination of big and small. There is room for more Elon Musks.  

 The world of food is fertile ground for big ideas and green tech innovation. Last summer saw the publication of new technology proposals to turn the waste shells of prawn, crab and lobster into nitrogen-rich chemicals for use, say, in pharmaceuticals, carbon sequestration and animal feed, which would avoid industrial production using fossil fuels.  

Farmers, too, are innovating worldwide. In Devon, Rebecca Hosking is using new land management techniques to make a contribution to fighting climate change. She uses a grazing method that purposely locks atmospheric carbon back into the soil. Instead of ploughing, her long-grass grazing technique keeps carbon in the roots, ploughing release-carbon from soil into the atmosphere. The more organic matter there is in the ground, the more it can trap in the carbon.  

 ""Once you lock it in, and as long as you don't plough or let your grassland dry out, then the carbon stays in the soil,"" she says. ""You know that climate change is happening, we do our bit and suck out as much carbon as we can.""  

 This method, which French farmers are also keen to implement, is similar in the way it works to a new, low-methane, genetically modified rice. SUSIBA2, the new rice, uses smaller roots, and produces less methane, one of the chief greenhouse gases. Scientists have also developed a feed supplement for dairy cows that could reduce methane emissions by 30 per cent.  

 Global warming is posing serious challenges to water supply; and we all know that the melting of glaciers is one detrimental effect of climate change. Cue another climate hero: Chewang Norphel, an 80-year-old retired civil engineer, has made 12 artificial glaciers in the last 30 years to provide water for the people of Ladakh, India. The Ice Man, as he is called, realised he could divert water through canals into frozen ice sheets, which would melt in spring and provide water for irrigation, agriculture and general local use. ""Getting water during the sowing period is the most crucial concern of the farmers because the natural glaciers start melting in the month of June and sowing starts in April and May,"" he told online news portal the Better India.  

 Ocean farmers are also growing kelp again to encourage a move away from environmentally costly meat-based diets. Indeed, 3D ocean farming proponents GreenWave quote a study that found a network of seaweed farms the size of Washington state could provide all the dietary protein for the entire world population.  

 Pope Francis's recent address sounded a note of caution around technology as a solution to climate change. ""Our immense technological development has not been accompanied by a development in human responsibility, values and conscience,"" he said.  

 Bill McKibben believes the key is solving the ""structural systemic problem rooted in the balance of political power on our planet."" To make a difference, he says, an individual must ""join with other people to build the kind of movement that can change those balances of power."" In Naomi Klein's book This Changes Everything, she writes about the Hollywood action movie narrative that tells us that, at the very last minute, some of us are going to be saved: ""Since our secular religion is technology, it won't be god that saves us but Bill Gates and his gang of super-geniuses at Intellectual Ventures.""  

 But, while some techno-fixes recall the Greek hubris myth of Icarus, there is work to be done and hope to be found. Around the world, people are working to improve 3D printing technology and the usability of tutorials to explain how to make Connell's DIY wind turbine or the German Sunzilla. Demand Logic, a company based in London, is using data to sweep big, commercial buildings in the city and work out where energy savings can be made.  

 Of the UN Climate Conference in Paris, McKibben says it will be most interesting to see whether countries will come up with the money to help poor countries leapfrog technologically. But he maintains that engineers and innovators are focusing their efforts in the right place, speeding up the transition from fossil fuels. Despite the Pope's cautionary note, the industry of technology is crucial in the shift to a newly balanced planet. McKibben praised the good, cheap solar panels we already have, but said they could be much more efficient and easier to adopt. ""There's no shortage of crucial and interesting work for architects, engineers and financiers, and none of it requires telling yourself science fiction stories, the way that you have to if all you can think of is, 'Let's put a giant piece of film in space to block the sun'.""

The Flying Dutchman of space was a harbinger

 of death. But Willard wasn't superstitions.

 He had seen the phantom—and lived.

The only friend in space Willard had ever known was dying. Dobbin's
 lips were parched and his breath came spasmodically. The tips of his
 fingers that had so many times caressed the control board of the
Mary
 Lou
were now black as meteor dust.


 ""We'll never see Earth again,"" he whispered feebly, plucked weakly at
 the cover.


 ""Nonsense!"" Willard broke in hurriedly, hoping that the dying man
 would not see through the lie. ""We've got the sun's gravity helping
 us drift back to Earth! We'll be there soon! You'll get well soon and
 we'll start to work again on a new idea of mine...."" His voice trailed
 helplessly away and the words were lost. It was no use.


 The sick man did not hear him. Two tears rolled down his cheeks. His
 face contorted as he tried to withhold a sob.


 ""To see Earth again!"" he said weakly. ""To walk on solid ground once
 more!""


 ""Four years!"" Willard echoed faintly. He knew how his space mate felt.
 No man can spend four years away from his home planet, and fail to be
 anguished. A man could live without friends, without fortune, but no
 man could live without Earth. He was like Anteus, for only the feel of
 the solid ground under his feet could give him courage to go among the
 stars.


 Willard also knew what he dared not admit to himself. He, too, like
 Dobbin, would never see Earth again. Perhaps, some thousand years from
 now, some lonely wanderers would find their battered hulk of a ship in
 space and bring them home again.


 Dobbin motioned to him and, in answer to a last request, Willard lifted
 him so he faced the port window for a final look at the panorama of the
 stars.


 Dobbin's eyes, dimming and half closed, took in the vast play of the
 heavens and in his mind he relived the days when in a frail craft he
 first crossed interstellar space. But for Earth-loneliness Dobbin would
 die a happy man, knowing that he had lived as much and as deeply as any
 man could.


 Silently the two men watched. Dobbin's eyes opened suddenly and a
 tremor seized his body. He turned painfully and looked at Willard.


 ""I saw it!"" his voice cracked, trembling.


 ""Saw what?""


 ""It's true! It's true! It comes whenever a space man dies! It's there!""


 ""In heaven's name, Dobbin,"" Willard demanded, ""What do you see? What is
 it?""


 Dobbin lifted his dark bony arm and pointed out into star-studded
 space.


 ""The Ghost Ship!""


 Something clicked in Willard's memory. He had heard it spoken of in
 whispers by drunken space men and professional tellers of fairy tales.
 But he had never put any stock in them. In some forgotten corner of
 Dobbin's mind the legend of the Ghost Ship must have lain, to come up
 in this time of delirium.


 ""There's nothing there,"" he said firmly.


 ""It's come—for me!"" Dobbin cried. He turned his head slowly toward
 Willard, tried to say something and then fell back upon the pillow. His
 mouth was open and his eyes stared unseeing ahead. Dobbin was now one
 with the vanished pioneers of yesterday. Willard was alone.


 For two days, reckoned in Earth time, Willard kept vigil over the body
 of his friend and space mate. When the time was up he did what was
 necessary and nothing remained of Harry Dobbin, the best friend he had
 ever had. The atoms of his body were now pure energy stored away in the
 useless motors of the
Mary Lou
.
The weeks that followed were like a blur in Willard's mind. Though the
 ship was utterly incapable of motion, the chance meteor that damaged
 it had spared the convertors and assimilators. Through constant care
 and attention the frail balance that meant life or death could be kept.
 The substance of waste and refuse was torn down and rebuilt as precious
 food and air. It was even possible to create more than was needed.


 When this was done, Willard immediately regretted it. For it would be
 then that the days and the weeks would roll by endlessly. Sometimes
 he thought he would go mad when, sitting at the useless control
 board, which was his habit, he would stare for hours and hours in
 the direction of the Sun where he knew the Earth would be. A great
 loneliness would then seize upon him and an agony that no man had ever
 known would tear at his heart. He would then turn away, full of despair
 and hopeless pain.


 Two years after Dobbin's death a strange thing happened. Willard was
 sitting at his accustomed place facing the unmoving vista of the stars.
 A chance glance at Orion's belt froze him still. A star had flickered!
 Distinctly, as if a light veil had been placed over it and then lifted,
 it dimmed and turned bright again. What strange phenomena was this? He
 watched and then another star faded momentarily in the exact fashion.
 And then a third! And a fourth! And a fifth!


 Willard's heart gave a leap and the lethargy of two years vanished
 instantly. Here, at last, was something to do. It might be only a few
 minutes before he would understand what it was, but those few minutes
 would help while away the maddening long hours. Perhaps it was a mass
 of fine meteorites or a pocket of gas that did not disperse, or even a
 moving warp of space-light. Whatever it was, it was a phenomena worth
 investigating and Willard seized upon it as a dying man seizes upon the
 last flashing seconds of life.


 Willard traced its course by the flickering stars and gradually plotted
 its semi-circular course. It was not from the solar system but,
 instead, headed toward it. A rapid check-up on his calculations caused
 his heart to beat in ever quickening excitement. Whatever it was, it
 would reach the
Mary Lou
.


 Again he looked out the port. Unquestionably the faint mass was nearing
 his ship. It was round in shape and almost invisible. The stars,
 though dimmed, could still be seen through it. There was something
 about its form that reminded him of an old-fashioned rocket ship. It
 resembled one of those that had done pioneer service in the lanes forty
 years ago or more. Resembled one? It was one! Unquestionably, though
 half-invisible and like a piece of glass immersed in water, it was a
 rocket ship.


 But the instruments on the control board could not lie. The presence of
 any material body within a hundred thousand miles would be revealed.
 But the needle on the gauge did not quiver. Nothing indicated the
 presence of a ship. But the evidence of his eyes was incontestable.


 Or was it? Doubt gripped him. Did the loneliness of all these years
 in space twist his mind till he was imagining the appearance of faint
 ghost-like rocket ships?


 The thought shot through his mind like a thunder bolt. Ghost Ship!
 Was this the thing that Dobbin had seen before he died? But that was
 impossible. Ghost Ships existed nowhere but in legends and tall tales
 told by men drunk with the liquors of Mars.


 ""There is no ship there. There is no ship there,"" Willard told himself
 over and over again as he looked at the vague outline of the ship, now
 motionless a few hundred miles away.


 Deep within him a faint voice cried, ""
It's come—for me!
"" but Willard
 stilled it. This was no fantasy. There was a scientific reason for it.
 There must be! Or should there be? Throughout all Earth history there
 had been Ghost Ships sailing the Seven Seas—ships doomed to roam
 forever because their crew broke some unbreakable law. If this was true
 for the ships of the seas, why not for the ships of empty space?


 He looked again at the strange ship. It was motionless. At least it was
 not nearing him. Willard could see nothing but its vague outline. A
 moment later he could discern a faint motion. It was turning! The Ghost
 Ship was turning back! Unconsciously Willard reached out with his hand
 as if to hold it back, for when it was gone he would be alone again.


 But the Ghost Ship went on. Its outline became smaller and smaller,
 fainter and fainter.


 Trembling, Willard turned away from the window as he saw the rocket
 recede and vanish into the emptiness of space. Once more the dreaded
 loneliness of the stars descended upon him.
Seven years passed and back on Earth in a small newspaper that Willard
 would never see there was published a small item:


 ""
Arden, Rocketport
—Thirteen years ago the Space Ship
Mary Lou
under John Willard and Larry Dobbin left the Rocket Port for the
 exploration of an alleged planetoid beyond Pluto. The ship has not been
 seen or heard from since. J. Willard, II, son of the lost explorer, is
 planning the manufacture of a super-size exploration ship to be called
Mary Lou II
, in memory of his father.""


 Memories die hard. A man who is alone in space with nothing but the
 cold friendship of star-light looks back upon memories as the only
 things both dear and precious to him.


 Willard, master and lone survivor of the
Mary Lou
, knew this well for
 he had tried to rip the memories of Earth out of his heart to ease the
 anguish of solitude within him. But it was a thing that could not be
 done.


 And so it was that each night—for Willard did not give up the
 Earth-habit of keeping time—Willard dreamed of the days he had known
 on Earth.


 In his mind's eye, he saw himself walking the streets of Arden and
 feeling the crunch of snow or the soft slap of rainwater under his
 feet. He heard again, in his mind, the voices of friends he knew.
 How beautiful and perfect was each voice! How filled with warmth and
 friendship! There was the voice of his beautiful wife whom he would
 never see again. There were the gruff and deep voices of his co-workers
 and scientists.


 Above all there were the voices of the cities, and the fields and the
 shops where he had worked. All these had their individual voices. Odd
 that he had never realized it before, but things become clearer to a
 man who is alone.


 Clearer? Perhaps not. Perhaps they become more clouded. How could he,
 for example, explain the phenomena of the Ghost Ship? Was it really
 only a product of his imagination? What of all the others who had
 seen it? Was it possible for many different men under many different
 situations to have the same exact illusion? Reason denied that. But
 perhaps space itself denies reason.


 Grimly he retraced the legend of the Ghost Ship. A chance phrase here
 and a story there put together all that he knew:


 Doomed for all eternity to wander in the empty star-lanes, the Ghost
 Ship haunts the Solar System that gave it birth. And this is its
 tragedy, for it is the home of spacemen who can never go home again.
 When your last measure of fuel is burnt and your ship becomes a
 lifeless hulk—the Ghost will come—for you!


 And this is all there was to the legend. Merely a tale of some fairy
 ship told to amuse and to while away the days of a star-voyage.
 Bitterly, Willard dismissed it from his mind.


 Another year of loneliness passed. And still another. Willard lost
 track of the days. It was difficult to keep time for to what purpose
 could time be kept. Here in space there was no time, nor was there
 reason for clocks and records. Days and months and years became
 meaningless words for things that once may have had meaning. About
 three years must have passed since his last record in the log book
 of the
Mary Lou
. At that time, he remembered, he suffered another
 great disappointment. On the port side there suddenly appeared a
 full-sized rocket ship. For many minutes Willard was half-mad with
 joy thinking that a passing ship was ready to rescue him. But the joy
 was short-lived, for the rocket ship abruptly turned away and slowly
 disappeared. As Willard watched it go away he saw the light of a
 distant star
through
the space ship. A heart-breaking agony fell upon
 him. It was not a ship from Earth. It was the Ghost Ship, mocking him.


 Since then Willard did not look out the window of his craft. A vague
 fear troubled him that perhaps the Ghost Ship might be here, waiting
 and watching, and that he would go mad if he saw it.


 How many years passed he could not tell. But this he knew. He was no
 longer a young man. Perhaps fifteen years has disappeared into nothing.
 Perhaps twenty. He did not know and he did not care.
Willard awoke from a deep sleep and prepared his bed. He did it, not
 because it was necessary, but because it was a habit that had long been
 ingrained in him through the years.


 He checked and rechecked every part of the still functioning mechanism
 of the ship. The radio, even though there was no one to call, was in
 perfect order. The speed-recording dials, even though there was no
 speed to record, were in perfect order. And so with every machine. All
 was in perfect order. Perfect useless order, he thought bitterly, when
 there was no way whatever to get sufficient power to get back to Earth,
 long forgotten Earth.


 He was leaning back in his chair when a vague uneasiness seized him.
 He arose and slowly walked over to the window, his age already being
 marked in the ache of his bones. Looking out into the silent theater of
 the stars, he suddenly froze.


 There was a ship, coming toward him!


 For a moment the reason in his mind tottered on a balance. Doubt
 assailed him. Was this the Ghost Ship come to torment him again? But no
 phantom this! It was a life and blood rocket ship from Earth! Starlight
 shone on it and not through it! Its lines, window, vents were all solid
 and had none of the ghost-like quality he remembered seeing in the
 Ghost Ship in his youth.
For another split second he thought that perhaps he, too, like Dobbin,
 had gone mad and that the ship would vanish just as it approached him.


 The tapping of the space-telegrapher reassured him.


 ""CALLING SPACE SHIP MARY LOU,"" the message rapped out, ""CALLING SPACE
 SHIP MARY LOU.""


 With trembling fingers that he could scarcely control, old Willard sent
 the answering message.


 ""SPACE SHIP MARY LOU REPLYING. RECEIVED MESSAGE. THANK GOD!""


 He broke off, unable to continue. His heart was ready to burst within
 him and the tears of joy were already welling in his eyes. He listened
 to the happiest message he had ever heard:


 ""NOTICE THAT SPACE SHIP MARY LOU IS DISABLED AND NOT SPACE WORTHY. YOU
 ARE INVITED TO COME ABOARD. HAVE YOU SPACE SUIT AND—ARE YOU ABLE TO
 COME?""


 Willard, already sobbing with joy, could send only two words.


 ""YES! COMING!""


 The years of waiting were over. At last he was free of the
Mary Lou
.
 In a dream like trance, he dressed in his space suit, pathetically
 glad that he had already checked every detail of it a short time ago.
 He realized suddenly that everything about the
Mary Lou
was hateful to
 him. It was here that his best friend died, and it was here that twenty
 years of his life were wasted completely in solitude and despair.


 He took one last look and stepped into the air-lock.


 The Earth-ship, he did not see its name, was only a hundred yards away
 and a man was already at the air-lock waiting to help him. A rope was
 tossed to him. He reached for it and made his way to the ship, leaving
 the
Mary Lou
behind him forever.


 Suddenly the world dropped away from him. Willard could neither see nor
 say anything. His heart was choked with emotion.


 ""It's all right,"" a kindly voice assured him, ""You're safe now.""


 He had the sensation of being carried by several men and then placed in
 bed. The quiet of deep sleep descended upon him.
He woke many times in the following days, but the privations of the
 passing years had drained his strength and his mind, had made him so
 much of a hermit that the presence of other men frightened him to the
 point of gibbering insanity.


 He knew that the food and drink were drugged, for after eating he
 never remembered seeing the men enter the room to care for him and to
 remove the dirty dishes. But there was enough sanity in his mind to
 also realize that, without the gradual reawakening of his senses to the
 value of human companionship, he might not be able to stand the mental
 shock of moving about among his people back on Earth.


 During those passing days, he savored each new impression, comparing
 it with what he remembered from that age-long past when he and his
 friends had walked on Earth's great plains and ridden on the oceans'
 sleek ships or flown with the wings of birds over the mountain ranges.
 And each impression was doubly enjoyable, for his memory was hazy and
 confused.


 Gradually, though, his mind cleared; he remembered the past, and he no
 longer was afraid of the men who visited him from time to time. But
 there was a strangeness about the men that he could not fathom; they
 refused to talk about anything, any subject, other than the actual
 running of the great ship. Always, when he asked his eager questions,
 they mumbled and drifted away.


 And then in his third week on the rescue ship, he went to sleep one
 night while peering from the port hole at the blue ball of Earth
 swimming in the blackness of space. He slept and he dreamed of the
 years he had spent by himself in the drifting, lifeless hulk of the
Mary Lou
. His dreams were vivid, peopled with men and women he had
 once known, and were horrible with the fantasies of terror that years
 of solitary brooding had implanted deep in his mind.
He awoke with a start and a cry of alarm ran through him as he thought
 that perhaps he might still be in the
Mary Lou
. The warm, smiling face
 of a man quickly reassured him.


 ""I'll call the captain,"" the space man said. ""He said to let him know
 when you came to.""


 Willard could only nod in weak and grateful acceptance. It was true! He
 pressed his head back against the bed's pillows. How soft! How warm! He
 yawned and stretched his arms as a thrill of happiness shot through his
 entire body.


 He would see Earth again! That single thought ran over and over in his
 mind without stopping. He would see Earth again! Perhaps not this year
 and perhaps not the next—for the ship might be on some extra-Plutonian
 expedition. But even if it would take years before it returned to home
 base Willard knew that those years would fly quickly if Earth was at
 the end of the trail.


 Though he had aged, he still had many years before him. And those
 years, he vowed, would be spent on Earth and nowhere else.


 The captain, a pleasant old fellow, came into the room as Willard stood
 up and tried to walk. The gravity here was a bit different from that of
 his ship, but he would manage.


 ""How do you feel, Space Man Willard?""


 ""Oh, you know me?"" Willard looked at him in surprise, and then smiled,
 ""Of course, you looked through the log book of the
Mary Lou
.""


 The captain nodded and Willard noticed with surprise that he was a very
 old man.


 ""You don't know how much I suffered there,"" Willard said slowly,
 measuring each word. ""Years in space—all alone! It's a horrible thing!""


 ""Yes?"" the old captain said.


 ""Many times I thought I would go completely mad. It was only the
 thought and hope that some day, somehow, an Earth-ship would find me
 and help me get back to Earth. If it was not for that, I would have
 died. I could think of nothing but of Earth, of blue green water, of
 vast open spaces and the good brown earth. How beautiful it must be
 now!""


 A note of sadness, matched only by that of Willard's, entered the
 captain's eyes.


 ""I want to walk on Earth just once—then I can die.""


 Willard stopped. A happy dreamy smile touched his lips.


 ""When will we go to Earth?"" he asked.


 The Captain did not answer. Willard waited and a strange memory tugged
 at him.


 ""You don't know,"" the Captain said. It was not a question or a
 statement. The Captain found it hard to say it. His lips moved slowly.


 Willard stepped back and before the Captain told him,
he knew
.


 ""Matter is relative,"" he said, ""the existent under one condition is
 non-existent under another. The real here is the non-real there. All
 things that wander alone in space are gradually drained of their mass
 and energy until nothing is left but mere shells. That is what happened
 to the
Mary Lou
. Your ship was real when we passed by twenty years
 ago. It is now like ours, a vague outline in space. We cannot feel
 the change ourselves, for change is relative. That is why we became
 more and more solid to you, as you became more and more faint to any
 Earth-ship that might have passed. We are real—to ourselves. But to
 some ship from Earth which has not been in space for more than fifteen
 years—to that ship, to all intents and purposes, we do not exist.


 ""Then this ship,"" Willard said, stunned, ""you and I and everything on
 it...""


 ""... are doomed,"" the Captain said. ""We cannot go to Earth for the
 simple reason that we would go
through
it!""


 The vision of Earth and green trees faded. He would never see Earth
 again. He would never feel the crunch of ground under feet as he
 walked. Never would listen to the voices of friends and the songs of
 birds. Never. Never. Never....


 ""Then this is the Ghost Ship and we are the Ghosts!""


 ""Yes.""

The pole stars of the other planets cluster around Polaris and Octans,
 but Uranus spins on a snobbishly different axis between Aldebaran and
 Antares. The Bull is her coronet and the Scorpion her footstool. Dear
 blowzy old bitch-planet, swollen and pale and cold, mad with your
 Shakespearean moons, white-mottled as death from Venerean Plague,
 spinning on your side like a poisoned pregnant cockroach, rolling
 around the sun like a fat drunken floozie with green hair rolling on
 the black floor of an infinite bar-room, what a sweet last view of the
 Solar System you are for a cleancut young spaceman....


 Grunfeld chopped off that train of thought short. He was young and
 the First Interstellar War had snatched him up and now it was going
 to pitch him and twenty other Joes out of the System on a fast curve
 breaking around Uranus—and so what! He shivered to get a little heat
 and then applied himself to the occulted star he was tracking through
Prospero's
bridge telescope. The star was a twentieth planetary
 diameter into Uranus, the crosslines showed—a glint almost lost in
 pale green. That meant its light was bulleting 1600 miles deep through
 the seventh planet's thick hydrogen atmosphere, unless he were seeing
 the star on a mirage trajectory—and at least its depth agreed with
 the time since rim contact.


 At 2000 miles he lost it. That should mean 2000 miles plus of hydrogen
 soup above the methane ocean, an America-wide layer of gaseous gunk for
 the captain to play the mad hero in with the fleet.


 Grunfeld didn't think the captain wanted to play the mad hero. The
 captain hadn't gone space-simple in any obvious way like Croker and
 Ness. And he wasn't, like Jackson, a telepathy-racked visionary
 entranced by the Enemy. Worry and responsibility had turned the
 captain's face into a skull which floated in Grunfeld's imagination
 when he wasn't actually seeing it, but the tired eyes deep-sunk in
 the dark sockets were still cool and perhaps sane. But because of the
 worry the captain always wanted to have the last bit of fact bearing
 on the least likely maneuver, and two pieces of evidence were better
 than one. Grunfeld found the next sizable star due to occult. Five-six
 minutes to rim contact. He floated back a foot from the telescope,
 stretching out his thin body in the plane of the ecliptic—strange how
 he automatically assumed that orientation in free fall! He blinked and
 blinked, then rested his eyes on the same planet he'd been straining
 them on.


 The pale greenish bulk of Uranus was centered in the big bridge
 spaceshield against the black velvet dark and bayonet-bright stars, a
 water-splotched and faded chartreuse tennis ball on the diamond-spiked
 bed of night. At eight million miles she looked half the width of Luna
 seen from Earth. Her whitish equatorial bands went from bottom to top,
 where, Grunfeld knew, they were spinning out of sight at three miles a
 second—a gelid waterfall that he imagined tugging at him with ghostly
 green gangrenous fingers and pulling him over into a hydrogen Niagara.


 Half as wide as Luna. But in a day she'd overflow the port as they
 whipped past her on a near miss and in another day she'd be as small
 as this again, but behind them, sunward, having altered their outward
 course by some small and as yet unpredictable angle, but no more able
 to slow
Prospero
and her sister ships or turn them back at their 100
 miles a second than the fleet's solar jets could operate at this chilly
 distance from Sol. G'by, fleet. G'by, C.C.Y. spaceman.
Grunfeld looked for the pale planet's moons. Miranda and Umbriel were
 too tiny to make disks, but he distinguished Ariel four diameters above
 the planet and Oberon a dozen below. Spectral sequins. If the fleet
 were going to get a radio signal from any of them, it would have to be
 Titania, occulted now by the planet and the noisy natural static of
 her roiling hydrogen air and seething methane seas—but it had always
 been only a faint hope that there were survivors from the First Uranus
 Expedition.


 Grunfeld relaxed his neck and let his gaze drift down across the
 curving star-bordered forward edge of
Prospero's
huge mirror and the
 thin jutting beams of the port lattice arm to the dim red-lit gages
 below the spaceshield.


 Forward Skin Temperature seven degrees Kelvin. Almost low enough for
 helium to crawl, if you had some helium.
Prospero's
insulation,
 originally designed to hold out solar heat, was doing a fair job in
 reverse.


 Aft (sunward) Skin Temperature 75 degrees Kelvin. Close to that of
 Uranus' sun-lit face. Check.


 Cabin Temperature 43 degrees Fahrenheit. Brr! The Captain was a miser
 with the chem fuel remaining. And rightly ... if it were right to drag
 out life as long as possible in the empty icebox beyond Uranus.


 Gravities of Acceleration zero. Many other zeros.


 The four telltales for the fleet unblinkingly glowed dimmest blue—one
 each for
Caliban
,
Snug
,
Moth
, and
Starveling
, following
Prospero
in line astern on slave automatic—though for months inertia
 had done all five ships' piloting. Once the buttons had been green,
 but they'd wiped that color off the boards because of the Enemy.


 The gages still showed their last maximums. Skin 793 Kelvin, Cabin
 144 Fahrenheit, Gravs 3.2. All of them hit almost a year ago, when
 they'd been ace-ing past the sun. Grunfeld's gaze edged back to the
 five bulbous pressure suits, once more rigidly upright in their braced
 racks, that they'd been wearing during that stretch of acceleration
 inside the orbit of Mercury. He started. For a moment he'd thought
 he saw the dark-circled eyes of the captain peering between two of
 the bulging black suits. Nerves! The captain had to be in his cabin,
 readying alternate piloting programs for Copperhead.


 Suddenly Grunfeld jerked his face back toward the spaceshield—so
 violently that his body began very slowly to spin in the opposite
 direction. This time he'd thought he saw the Enemy's green flashing
 near the margin of the planet—bright green, viridian, far vivider than
 that of Uranus herself. He drew himself to the telescope and feverishly
 studied the area. Nothing at all. Nerves again. If the Enemy were much
 nearer than a light-minute, Jackson would esp it and give warning. The
 next star was still three minutes from rim contact. Grunfeld's mind
 retreated to the circumstances that had brought
Prospero
(then only
Mercury One
) out here.
II


 When the First Interstellar War erupted, the pioneer fleets of Earth's
 nations had barely pushed their explorations beyond the orbit of
 Saturn. Except for the vessels of the International Meteor Guard,
 spaceflight was still a military enterprise of America, Russia, England
 and the other mega-powers.


 During the first months the advantage lay wholly with the slim black
 cruisers of the Enemy, who had an antigravity which allowed them
 to hover near planets without going into orbit; and a frightening
 degree of control over light itself. Indeed, their principal weapon
 was a tight beam of visible light, a dense photonic stiletto with an
 effective range of several Jupiter-diameters in vacuum. They also
 used visible light, in the green band, for communication as men use
 radio, sometimes broadcasting it and sometimes beaming it loosely in
 strange abstract pictures that seemed part of their language. Their
 gravity-immune ships moved by reaction to photonic jets the tightness
 of which rendered them invisible except near the sun, where they tended
 to ionize electronically dirty volumes of space. It was probably this
 effective invisibility, based on light-control, which allowed them to
 penetrate the Solar System as deep as Earth's orbit undetected, rather
 than any power of travel in time or sub-space, as was first assumed.
 Earthmen could only guess at the physical appearance of the Enemy,
 since no prisoners were taken on either side.


 Despite his impressive maneuverability and armament, the Enemy was
 oddly timid about attacking live planets. He showed no fear of the big
 gas planets, in fact hovering very close to their turgid surfaces, as
 if having some way of fueling from them.


 Near Terra the first tactic of the black cruisers, after destroying
 Lunostrovok and Circumluna, was to hover behind the moon, as though
 sharing its tide-lockedness—a circumstance that led to a sortie by
 Earth's Combined Fleet, England and Sweden excepted.


 At the wholly disastrous Battle of the Far Side, which was visible in
 part to naked-eye viewers on Earth, the Combined Fleet was annihilated.
 No Enemy ship was captured, boarded, or seriously damaged—except
 for one which, apparently by a fluke, was struck by a fission-headed
 anti-missile and proceeded after the blast to ""burn,"" meaning that it
 suffered a slow and puzzling disintegration, accompanied by a dazzling
 rainbow display of visible radiation. This was before the ""stupidity""
 of the Enemy with regard to small atomic missiles was noted, or their
 allergy to certain radio wave bands, and also before Terran telepaths
 began to claim cloudy contact with Enemy minds.


 Following Far Side, the Enemy burst into activity, harrying Terran
 spacecraft as far as Mercury and Saturn, though still showing great
 caution in maneuver and making no direct attacks on planets. It was as
 if a race of heavily armed marine creatures should sink all ocean-going
 ships or drive them to harbor, but make no assaults beyond the shore
 line. For a full year Earth, though her groundside and satellite
 rocketyards were furiously busy, had no vehicle in deep space—with one
 exception.
At the onset of the War a fleet of five mobile bases of the U. S. Space
 Force were in Orbit to Mercury, where it was intended they take up
 satellite positions prior to the prospecting and mineral exploitation
 of the small sun-blasted planet. These five ships, each with a skeleton
 five-man crew, were essentially Ross-Smith space stations with a solar
 drive, assembled in space and intended solely for space-to-space flight
 inside Earth's orbit. A huge paraboloid mirror, its diameter four times
 the length of the ship's hull, superheated at its focus the hydrogen
 which was ejected as a plasma at high exhaust velocity. Each ship
 likewise mounted versatile radio-radar equipment on dual lattice arms
 and carried as ship's launch a two-man chemical fuel rocket adaptable
 as a fusion-headed torpedo.


 After Far Side, this ""tin can"" fleet was ordered to bypass Mercury
 and, tacking on the sun, shape an orbit for Uranus, chiefly because
 that remote planet, making its 84-year circuit of Sol, was currently
 on the opposite side of the sun to the four inner planets and the two
 nearer gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. In the empty regions of space the
 relatively defenseless fleet might escape the attention of the Enemy.


 However, while still accelerating into the sun for maximum boost, the
 fleet received information that two Enemy cruisers were in pursuit. The
 five ships cracked on all possible speed, drawing on the solar drive's
 high efficiency near the sun and expending all their hydrogen and most
 material capable of being vaporized, including some of the light-metal
 hydrogen storage tanks—like an old steamer burning her cabin furniture
 and the cabins themselves to win a race. Gradually the curving course
 that would have taken years to reach the outer planet flattened into a
 hyperbola that would make the journey in 200 days.


 In the asteroid belt the pursuing cruisers turned aside to join in the
 crucial Battle of the Trojans with Earth's largely new-built, more
 heavily and wisely armed Combined Fleet—a battle that proved to be
 only a prelude to the decisive Battle of Jupiter.


 Meanwhile the five-ship fleet sped onward, its solar drive quite
 useless in this twilight region even if it could have scraped together
 the needed boilable ejectant mass to slow its flight. Weeks became
 months. The ships were renamed for the planet they were aimed at. At
 least the fleet's trajectory had been truly set.


 Almost on collision course it neared Uranus, a mystery-cored ball
 of frigid gas 32,000 miles wide coasting through space across the
 fleet's course at a lazy four miles a second. At this time the fleet
 was traveling at 100 miles a second. Beyond Uranus lay only the
 interstellar night, into which the fleet would inevitably vanish....
Unless, Grunfeld told himself ... unless the fleet shed its velocity by
 ramming the gaseous bulk of Uranus. This idea of atmospheric braking
 on a grand scale had sounded possible at first suggestion, half a
 year ago—a little like a man falling off a mountain or from a plane
 and saving his life by dropping into a great thickness of feathery
 new-fallen snow.


 Supposing her solar jet worked out here and she had the reaction
 mass,
Prospero
could have shed her present velocity in five hours,
 decelerating at a comfortable one G.


 But allowing her 12,000 miles of straight-line travel through Uranus'
 frigid soupy atmosphere—and that might be dipping very close to
 the methane seas blanketing the planet's hypothetical mineral
 core—
Prospero
would have two minutes in which to shed her velocity.


 Two minutes—at 150 Gs.


 Men had stood 40 and 50 Gs for a fractional second.


 But for two minutes.... Grunfeld told himself that the only surer way
 to die would be to run into a section of the Enemy fleet. According to
 one calculation the ship's skin would melt by heat of friction in 90
 seconds, despite the low temperature of the abrading atmosphere.


 The star Grunfeld had been waiting for touched the hazy rim of Uranus.
 He drifted back to the eyepiece and began to follow it in as the pale
 planet's hydrogen muted its diamond brilliance.
III


 In the aft cabin, lank hairy-wristed Croker pinned another blanket
 around black Jackson as the latter shivered in his trance. Then Croker
 turned on a small light at the head of the hammock.


 ""Captain won't like that,"" plump pale Ness observed tranquilly from
 where he floated in womb position across the cabin. ""Enemy can feel
 a candle of
our
light, captain says, ten million miles away."" He
 rocked his elbows for warmth and his body wobbled in reaction like a
 polly-wog's.


 ""And Jackson hears the Enemy think ... and Heimdall hears the grass
 grow,"" Croker commented with a harsh manic laugh. ""Isn't an Enemy for
 a billion miles, Ness."" He launched aft from the hammock. ""We haven't
 spotted their green since Saturn orbit. There's nowhere for them.""


 ""There's the far side of Uranus,"" Ness pointed out. ""That's less than
 ten million miles now. Eight. A bare day. They could be there.""


 ""Yes, waiting to bushwack us as we whip past on our way to eternity,""
 Croker chuckled as he crumpled up against the aft port, shedding
 momentum. ""That's likely, isn't it, when they didn't have time for us
 back in the Belt?"" He scowled at the tiny white sun, no bigger a disk
 than Venus, but still with one hundred times as much light as the full
 moon pouring from it—too much light to look at comfortably. He began
 to button the inner cover over the port.


 ""Don't do that,"" Ness objected without conviction. ""There's not much
 heat in it but there's some."" He hugged his elbows and shivered. ""I
 don't remember being warm since Mars orbit.""


 ""The sun gets on my nerves,"" Croker said. ""It's like looking at an
 arc light through a pinhole. It's like a high, high jail light in a
 cold concrete yard. The stars are highlights on the barbed wire."" He
 continued to button out the sun.


 ""You ever in jail?"" Ness asked. Croker grinned.
With the tropism of a fish, Ness began to paddle toward the little
 light at the head of Jackson's hammock, flicking his hands from the
 wrists like flippers. ""I got one thing against the sun,"" he said
 quietly. ""It's blanketing out the radio. I'd like us to get one more
 message from Earth. We haven't tried rigging our mirror to catch radio
 waves. I'd like to hear how we won the battle of Jupiter.""


 ""If we won it,"" Croker said.


 ""Our telescopes show no more green around Jove,"" Ness reminded him. ""We
 counted 27 rainbows of Enemy cruisers 'burning.' Captain verified the
 count.""


 ""Repeat: if we won it."" Croker pushed off and drifted back toward the
 hammock. ""If there was a real victory message they'd push it through,
 even if the sun's in the way and it takes three hours to catch us.
 People who win, shout.""


 Ness shrugged as he paddled. ""One way or the other, we should be
 getting the news soon from Titania station,"" he said. ""They'll have
 heard.""


 ""If they're still alive and there ever was a Titania Station,"" Croker
 amended, backing air violently to stop himself as he neared the
 hammock. ""Look, Ness, we know that the First Uranus Expedition arrived.
 At least they set off their flares. But that was three years before the
 War and we haven't any idea of what's happened to them since and if
 they ever managed to set up housekeeping on Titania—or Ariel or Oberon
 or even Miranda or Umbriel. At least if they built a station that could
 raise Earth I haven't been told. Sure thing
Prospero
hasn't heard
 anything ... and we're getting close.""


 ""I won't argue,"" Ness said. ""Even if we raise 'em, it'll just be
 hello-goodby with maybe time between for a battle report.""


 ""And a football score and a short letter from home, ten seconds per
 man as the station fades."" Croker frowned and added, ""If Captain had
 cottoned to my idea, two of us at any rate could have got off this
 express train at Uranus.""


 ""Tell me how,"" Ness asked drily.


 ""How? Why, one of the ship's launches. Replace the fusion-head with
 the cabin. Put all the chem fuel in the tanks instead of divvying it
 between the ship and the launch.""


 ""I haven't got the brain for math Copperhead has, but I can subtract,""
 Ness said, referring to
Prospero's
piloting robot. ""Fully fueled, one
 of the launches has a max velocity change in free-fall of 30 miles per
 second. Use it all in braking and you've only taken 30 from 100. The
 launch is still going past Uranus and out of the system at 70 miles a
 second.""


 ""You didn't hear all my idea,"" Croker said. ""You put piggyback tanks
 on your launch and top them off with the fuel from the other four
 launches. Then you've 100 miles of braking
and
a maneuvering reserve.
 You only need to shed 90 miles, anyway. Ten miles a second's the close
 circum-Uranian velocity. Go into circum-Uranian orbit and wait for
 Titania to send their jeep to pick you up. Have to start the maneuver
 four hours this side of Uranus, though. Take that long at 1 G to shed
 it.""


 ""Cute,"" Ness conceded. ""Especially the jeep. But I'm glad just the same
 we've got 70 per cent of our chem fuel in our ships' tanks instead of
 the launches. We're on such a bull's eye course for Uranus—Copperhead
 really pulled a miracle plotting our orbit—that we may need a
 sidewise shove to miss her. If we slapped into that cold hydrogen soup
 at our 100 mps—""


 Croker shrugged. ""We still could have dropped a couple of us,"" he said.
""Captain's got to look after the whole fleet,"" Ness said. ""You're
 beginning to agitate, Croker, like you was Grunfeld—or the captain
 himself.""


 ""But if Titania Station's alive, a couple of men dropped off would do
 the fleet some good. Stir Titania up to punch a message through to
 Earth and get a really high-speed retrieve-and-rescue ship started out
 after us.
If
we've won the War.""


 ""But Titania Station's dead or never was, not to mention its jeep. And
 we've lost the Battle of Jupiter. You said so yourself,"" Ness asserted
 owlishly. ""Captain's got to look after the whole fleet.""


 ""Yeah, so he kills himself fretting and the rest of us die of old age
 in the outskirts of the Solar System. Join the Space Force and See the
 Stars! Ness, do you know how long it'd take us to reach the nearest
 star—except we aren't headed for her—at our 100 mps? Eight thousand
 years!""


 ""That's a lot of time to kill,"" Ness said. ""Let's play chess.""


 Jackson sighed and they both looked quickly at the dark unlined face
 above the cocoon, but the lips did not flutter again, or the eyelids.
 Croker said, ""Suppose he knows what the Enemy looks like?""


 ""I suppose,"" Ness said. ""When he talks about them it's as if he was
 their interpreter. How about the chess?""


 ""Suits. Knight to King Bishop Three.""


 ""Hmm. Knight to King Knight Two, Third Floor.""


 ""Hey, I meant flat chess, not three-D,"" Croker objected.


 ""That thin old game? Why, I no sooner start to get the position really
 visualized in my head than the game's over.""


 ""I don't want to start a game of three-D with Uranus only 18 hours
 away.""


 Jackson stirred in his hammock. His lips worked. ""They...."" he
 breathed. Croker and Ness instantly watched him. ""They....""


 ""I wonder if he is really inside the Enemy's mind?"" Ness said.


 ""He thinks he speaks for them,"" Croker replied and the next instant
 felt a warning touch on his arm and looked sideways and saw
 dark-circled eyes in a skull-angular face under a battered cap with a
 tarnished sunburst. Damn, thought Croker, how does the captain always
 know when Jackson's going to talk?


 ""They are waiting for us on the other side of Uranus,"" Jackson
 breathed. His lips trembled into a smile and his voice grew a little
 louder, though his eyes stayed shut. ""They're welcoming us, they're
 our brothers."" The smile died. ""But they know they got to kill us, they
 know we got to die.""


 The hammock with its tight-swathed form began to move past Croker and
 he snatched at it. The captain had pushed off from him for the hatch
 leading forward.
Grunfeld was losing the new star at 2200 miles into Uranus when he saw
 the two viridian flares flashing between it and the rim. Each flash was
 circled by a fleeting bright green ring, like a mist halo. He thought
 he'd be afraid when he saw that green again, but what he felt was a
 jolt of excitement that made him grin. With it came a touch on his
 shoulder. He thought, the captain always knows.


 ""Ambush,"" he said. ""At least two cruisers.""


 He yielded the eyepiece to the captain. Even without the telescope he
 could see those incredibly brilliant green flickers. He asked himself
 if the Enemy was already gunning for the fleet through Uranus.


 The blue telltales for
Caliban
and
Starveling
began to blink.


 ""They've seen it too,"" the captain said. He snatched up the mike and
 his next words rang through the
Prospero
.


 ""Rig ship for the snowbank orbit! Snowbank orbit with stinger! Mr.
 Grunfeld, raise the fleet.""


 Aft, Croker muttered, ""Rig our shrouds, don't he mean? Rig shrouds and
 firecrackers mounted on Fourth of July rockets.""


 Ness said, ""Cheer up. Even the longest strategic withdrawal in history
 has to end some time.""
IV


 Three quarters of a day later Grunfeld felt a spasm of futile fear and
 revolt as the pressure suit closed like a thick-fleshed carnivorous
 plant on his drugged and tired body. Relax, he told himself. Fine thing
 if you cooked up a fuss when even Croker didn't. He thought of forty
 things to re-check. Relax, he repeated—the work's over; all that
 matters is in Copperhead's memory tanks now, or will be as soon as the
 captain's suited up.


 The suit held Grunfeld erect, his arms at his sides—the best attitude,
 except he was still facing forward, for taking high G, providing the
 ship herself didn't start to tumble. Only the cheekpieces and visor
 hadn't closed in on his face—translucent hand-thick petals as yet
 unfolded. He felt the delicate firm pressure of built-in fingertips
 monitoring his pulses and against his buttocks the cold smooth muzzles
 of the jet hypodermics that would feed him metronomic drugs during the
 high-G stretch and stimulants when they were in free-fall again. When.


 He could swing his head and eyes just enough to make out the suits of
 Croker and Ness to either side of him and their profiles wavy through
 the jutting misty cheekpieces. Ahead to the left was Jackson—just
 the back of his suit, like a black snowman standing at attention,
 pale-olive-edged by the great glow of Uranus. And to the right the
 captain, his legs suited but his upper body still bent out to the side
 as he checked the monitor of his suit with its glowing blue button and
 the manual controls that would lie under his hands during the maneuver.
Beyond the captain was the spaceshield, the lower quarter of it
 still blackness and stars, but the upper three-quarters filled with
 the onrushing planet's pale mottled green that now had the dulled
 richness of watered silk. They were so close that the rim hardly showed
 curvature. The atmosphere must have a steep gradient, Grunfeld thought,
 or they'd already be feeling decel. That stuff ahead looked more like
 water than any kind of air. It bothered him that the captain was still
 half out of his suit.


 There should be action and shouted commands, Grunfeld thought, to fill
 up these last tight-stretched minutes. Last orders to the fleet, port
 covers being cranked shut, someone doing a countdown on the firing of
 their torpedo. But the last message had gone to the fleet minutes ago.
 Its robot pilots were set to follow
Prospero
and imitate, nothing
 else. And all the rest was up to Copperhead. Still....


 Grunfeld wet his lips. ""Captain,"" he said hesitantly. ""Captain?""


 ""Thank you, Grunfeld."" He caught the edge of the skull's answering
 grin. ""We
are
beginning to hit hydrogen,"" the quiet voice went on.
 ""Forward skin temperature's up to 9 K.""


 Beyond the friendly skull, a great patch of the rim of Uranus flared
 bright green. As if that final stimulus had been needed, Jackson began
 to talk dreamily from his suit.


 ""They're still welcoming us and grieving for us. I begin to get it a
 little more now. Their ship's one thing and they're another. Their
 ship is frightened to death of us. It hates us and the only thing it
 knows to do is to kill us. They can't stop it, they're even less than
 passengers....""


 The captain was in his suit now. Grunfeld sensed a faint throbbing and
 felt a rush of cold air. The cabin refrigeration system had started up,
 carrying cabin heat to the lattice arms. Intended to protect them from
 solar heat, it would now do what it could against the heat of friction.


 The straight edge of Uranus was getting hazier. Even the fainter
 stars shone through, spangling it. A bell jangled and the pale green
 segment narrowed as the steel meteor panels began to close in front
 of the spaceshield. Soon there was only a narrow vertical ribbon of
 green—
bright
green as it narrowed to a thread—then for a few
 seconds only blackness except for the dim red and blue beads and
 semi-circles, just beyond the captain, of the board. Then the muted
 interior cabin lights glowed on.
Jackson droned: ""They and their ships come from very far away, from the
 edge. If this is the continuum, they come from the ... discontinuum,
 where they don't have stars but something else and where gravity is
 different. Their ships came from the edge on a gust of fear with the
 other ships, and our brothers came with it though they didn't want
 to....""


 And now Grunfeld thought he began to feel it—the first faint thrill,
 less than a cobweb's tug, of
weight
.


 The cabin wall moved sideways. Grunfeld's suit had begun to revolve
 slowly on a vertical axis.


 For a moment he glimpsed Jackson's dark profile—all five suits were
 revolving in their framework. They locked into position when the men in
 them were facing aft. Now at least retinas wouldn't pull forward at
 high-G decel, or spines crush through thorax and abdomen.


 The cabin air was cold on Grunfeld's forehead. And now he was sure he
 felt weight—maybe five pounds of it. Suddenly aft was
up
. It was as
 if he were lying on his back on the spaceshield.


 A sudden snarling roar came through his suit from the beams bracing it.
 He lost weight, then regained it and a little more besides. He realized
 it was their torpedo taking off, to skim by Uranus in the top of the
 atmosphere and then curve inward the little their chem fuel would let
 them, homing toward the Enemy. He imaged its tiny red jet over the
 great gray-green glowing plain. Four more would be taking off from the
 other ships—the fleet's feeble sting. Like a bee's, just one, in dying.


 The cheekpieces and foreheadpiece of Grunfeld's suit began to close on
 his face like layers of pliable ice.


 Jackson called faintly, ""
Now
I understand. Their ship—"" His voice
 was cut off.


 Grunfeld's ice-mask was tight shut. He felt a small surge of vigor as
 the suit took over his breathing and sent his lungs a gush of high-oxy
 air. Then came a tingling numbness as the suit field went on, adding an
 extra prop against decel to each molecule of his body.


 But the weight was growing. He was on the moon now ... now on Mars ...
 now back on Earth....


 The weight was stifling now, crushing—a hill of invisible sand.
 Grunfeld saw a black pillow hanging in the cabin above him aft. It had
 red fringe around it. It grew.


 There was a whistling and shaking. Everything lurched torturingly, the
 ship's jets roared, everything recovered, or didn't.


 The black pillow came down on him, crushing out sight, crushing out
 thought.
The universe was a black tingling, a limitless ache floating in a
 larger black infinity. Something drew back and there was a dry fiery
 wind on numb humps and ridges—the cabin air on his face, Grunfeld
 decided, then shivered and started at the thought that he was alive and
 in free-fall. His body didn't feel like a mass of internal hemorrhages.
 Or did it?


 He spun slowly. It stopped. Dizziness? Or the suits revolving forward
 again? If they'd actually come through—


 There was a creaking and cracking. The ship contracting after
 frictional heating?


 There was a faint stink like ammonia and formaldehyde mixed. A few
 Uranian molecules forced past plates racked by turbulence?


 He saw dim red specks. The board? Or last flickers from ruined
 retinas? A bell jangled. He waited, but he saw nothing. Blind? Or the
 meteor guard jammed? No wonder if it were. No wonder if the cabin
 lights were broken.


 The hot air that had dried his sweaty face rushed down the front of his
 body. Needles of pain pierced him as he slumped forward out of the top
 of his opening suit.


 Then he saw the horizontal band of stars outlining the top of the
 spaceshield and below it the great field of inky black, barely convex
 upward,
that must
, he realized,
be the dark side of Uranus
.


 Pain ignored, Grunfeld pushed himself forward out of his suit and
 pulled himself past the captain's to the spaceshield.


 The view stayed the same, though broadening out: stars above, a
 curve-edged velvet black plain below. They were orbiting.


 A pulsing, color-changing glow from somewhere showed him twisted stumps
 of the radio lattices. There was no sign of the mirror at all. It must
 have been torn away, or vaporized completely, in the fiery turbulence
 of decel.


 New maxs showed on the board: Cabin Temperature 214 F, Skin Temperature
 907 K, Gravs 87.


 Then in the top of the spacefield, almost out of vision, Grunfeld saw
 the source of the pulsing glow: two sharp-ended ovals flickering
 brightly all colors against the pale starfields, like two dead fish
 phosphorescing.
""The torps got to 'em,"" Croker said, pushed forward beside Grunfeld to
 the right.
""I did find out at the end,"" Jackson said quietly from the left, his
 voice at last free of the trance-tone. ""The Enemy ships weren't ships
 at all. They were (there's no other word for it) space animals. We've
 always thought life was a prerogative of planets, that space was
 inorganic. But you can walk miles through the desert or sail leagues
 through the sea before you notice life and I guess space is the
 same. Anyway the Enemy was (what else can I call 'em?) space-whales.
 Inertialess space-whales from the discontinuum. Space-whales that ate
 hydrogen (that's the only way I know to say it) and spat light to
 move and fight. The ones I talked to, our brothers, were just their
 parasites.""


 ""That's crazy,"" Grunfeld said. ""All of it. A child's picture.""


 ""Sure it is,"" Jackson agreed.


 From beyond Jackson, Ness, punching buttons, said, ""Quiet.""


 The radio came on thin and wailing with static: ""Titania Station
 calling fleet. We have jeep and can orbit in to you. The two Enemy are
 dead—the last in the System. Titania Station calling fleet. We have
 jeep fueled and set to go—""


 Fleet? thought Grunfeld. He turned back to the board. The first and
 last blue telltales still glowed for
Caliban
and
Starveling
.
 Breathe a prayer, he thought, for
Moth
and
Snug
.


 Something else shone on the board, something Grunfeld knew had to be
 wrong. Three little words: SHIP ON MANUAL.


 The black rim of Uranus ahead suddenly brightened along its length,
 which was very slightly bowed, like a section of a giant new moon. A
 bead formed toward the center, brightened, and then all at once the
 jail-yard sun had risen and was glaring coldly through its pinhole into
 their eyes.


 They looked away from it. Grunfeld turned around.


 The austere light showed the captain still in his pressure suit, only
 the head fallen out forward, hiding the skull features. Studying the
 monitor box of the captain's suit, Grunfeld saw it was set to inject
 the captain with power stimulants as soon as the Gravs began to slacken
 from their max.


 He realized who had done the impossible job of piloting them out of
 Uranus.


 But the button on the monitor, that should have glowed blue, was as
 dark as those of
Moth
and
Snug
.


 Grunfeld thought, now he can rest.

Leah Barrow would die. Tar Norn had sworn she

 would, unless he was set free. But freedom for

 the Venusian Pirate meant death for many, and

 it was Director Barrow's duty to hold him—even

 though it would cost his daughter's life.

Mart Wells shut off the alarm buzzer and jumped out of bed—much to his
 regret. He cussed and then grinned sheepishly as he brought up with a
 thud against the fortunately unbreakable glass of the window. A year
 on Callisto, and he could still forget that he weighed only thirty-six
 pounds and couldn't take a normal step without neutronium-weighted
 shoes.


 Regaining his balance, he yawned and looked out over the rough Callisto
 landscape beyond Comprotown. Then he yawned again and reached for his
 uniform.


 A year before, Comprotown—and his job as rocketport dispatcher—had
 been Romance with a capital R. Now, he thought gloomily, Romance with
 Leah with a capital L, and a fat lot of good that did him when Leah
 Barrow's father was Old Fish-face himself, Director of Comprotown.


 True, Comprotown held fewer than a thousand colonists, but it was the
 only inhabited spot on bleak Callisto, and its Director was practical
 czar of a world. Yes, the Director could well afford to look down his
 long nose at any uniform with fewer than six stars on its right sleeve.
 But Leah didn't feel that—


 Suddenly, straightening up as he fastened his weighted boot, he looked
 more intently out of the window. Something that flashed caught his eye
 out in the barren, warped hills. A gleam of metal where metal shouldn't
 have been. And it looked like a small spaceship.


 Mart hastily pulled on his other boot and ran down the stairs. A
 red-headed mechanic from the rocketport was coming out of the building
 across the way.


 Mart called out, ""Red! Something about a mile back in the hills looks
 like a spaceship. Has one been reported down?""


 ""Huh?"" The mechanic looked startled. ""You sure? No, there hasn't been a
 report. Wait, I'll radio Central Communications.""


 He darted back into the building, and emerged a moment later. ""No
 report. They're going to send out the autogiro to look at it. Say,
 Mart, there are only two small spaceships on Callisto. Could it be—""


 Mart was already running toward the corner from which he could see the
 landing field. He stopped so suddenly that the mechanic almost ran into
 him, and said, ""Whew! They're both there."" Leah Barrow's trim little
 spacecruiser was safe in port. So was the Police one-seater scout—but
 that wasn't the one Mart had looked for first.


 From near the Administration Building a two-place autogiro was rising,
 silhouetted for a moment between the horns of the reddish crescent of
 big Jupiter just above the horizon.


 As he walked across the field toward headquarters, Mart surveyed the
 familiar scene. Three squat freighters were up on the racks, their ugly
 black bottoms over the ash-filled blasting pits; four others were on
 dollies ready to be serviced.


 All seven were ready for their regular weekly Callisto-Jupe hop,
 ready to pick up more ore. And, as usual, they'd go out today to
 clear the field for the sleeker, faster, long-haul ships that would
 arrive from Earth tomorrow for the smelted metal. Mart glanced at his
 wrist-chronometer. Eight o'clock now; in an hour and a half,
Freighter
 One
, right on schedule, would start testing its rocket tubes for the
 ten o'clock hop. And an hour later,
Freighter Two
would start to warm
 up for the eleven o'clock blasting-off. And then the others, every hour
 on the hour.


 At his desk in the Administration Building, Mart picked up the familiar
 sheaf of clearance papers waiting for his attention, and glanced
 through them. Initialing them was mere routine; they'd never cleared a
 minute early or a minute late since he'd been there. Director Barrow
 saw to that.


 The door opened. Mart put down the papers and glanced up.
One of the workmen from the smelting plant, a tall black-haired fellow
 wearing tinted glasses, stood looking into the office. Mart didn't
 remember ever seeing him before—but with several hundred workmen, you
 couldn't remember all of them.


 ""Director Barrow in?""


 Mart glanced up at the wall clock before he answered. ""He'll be here in
 twenty-one minutes. Sit down and wait if you're off duty.""


 He turned back to the papers and finished initialing them, grinning
 inwardly at being able to say that the Director would arrive in
 twenty-one minutes exactly. It wasn't everywhere that one could make
 so accurate a prediction about anyone's arrival time, but Barrow was
 something of a chronometer himself.


 He tossed the papers toward the back of the desk and threw the switch
 of the communicator on his desk, leaned forward slightly. ""Dispatcher
 Wells calling Police Autogiro.""


 ""Autogiro, Captain Wayne,"" came the reply. ""Go ahead. Mart.""


 ""I was the one who reported seeing the spaceship, Cap—if it was one.
 Found it? If not, I can—""


 ""Thanks, Mart, but we've sighted it all right. We're now circling,
 looking for a spot to come down. It doesn't take much, but damned if we
 can perch on a ridge like a canary. Neither could that space-speedster
 down there.


 ""Wrecked? What's it look like?""


 ""Ummm. Offhand one of the single-place jobs that Venusians bought from
 Earth before the war. Full armament, too.""


 ""What? You sure, Cap? After the Earth-Venus twenty-two eighty treaty,
 we reclaimed and destroyed all the armed—""


 ""Yeah, I know,"" cut in the Captain's voice. ""All but a few that the
 Venusian renegades—the pirates—got off with before then. Well—we're
 going down. Corey's found a place not too far from it where he can set
 the giro down, or says he can.""


 ""If that's a pirate ship, Cap, be careful!""


 ""Don't worry. We're armed. And the ship's pretty smashed up. Probably
 at least kayoed whoever was in it. Well, keep your key open and I'll
 call you back. We're down.""


 Mart found the shipment chart and began to check off tonnage. That much
 he wanted to get out of the way before—but something was gnawing at
 the back of his mind. It took him a moment to trace what it was. Of
 course. The workman who was waiting for the Director was wearing tinted
 glasses.


 Tinted glasses on Callisto! It didn't make sense. The sun, half a
 billion miles away, gives only a twenty-fifth of the light that falls
 on Earth. Even when that light is augmented by Big Jupe, it isn't—Yes,
 it was the first time he'd seen tinted glasses in Comprotown.


 Curiously, he turned to glance at the seated workman. But the carrier
 wave of the desk communicator hummed and he forgot his visitor as
 Captain Wayne's voice boomed in.


 ""Dispatcher Wells. Captain Wayne calling Dispatcher—""


 ""Okay, Cap. Go ahead.""


 ""We've examined the spaceship. No one's in it, hurt or otherwise. It's
 a single seater. A pirate ship all right.""


 ""You sure? How can you be certain?""


 ""Aside from the fact that it would have no business around here if it
 wasn't, the papers are a give-away. There's a whole sheaf of them.
 Reports on the Ganymede jewel shipments mostly. And a full set of data
 on our own little world, Mart. If there's a Venusian around, he sure
 knows his way.""


 ""Dope on Callisto? What kind?""


 ""A detailed map of Comprotown, showing every building. A full schedule
 of freighter hops both ways to Jupe and Earth. Details of shipments.
 That sort of thing.""


 ""Holy stars! But why should a pirate be interested in ore?""


 ""Don't imagine he is. Or in Comprotown, either. I'd say from the
 papers, it was precautionary information. We don't keep our operations
 a secret here. He could have picked it up from any magazine article
 describing Comprotown in detail.


 ""But I still don't see—""


 ""The Ganymede jewel shipments, Mart. I'd say he was bound for Gany and
 his ship went blooie while he was scudding past Callisto. He got pulled
 down here and just barely made a landing he could walk away from. I'm
 afraid there'll be trouble.""


 Mart whistled. ""Well, the Director's due now. He'll want a search
 organized and—Wait, here he is. Tell it over again, Cap, and you'll be
 reporting direct.... Listen to this, Director.""
The tall slender figure of Director Barrow stood impassively beside
 Mart's desk and listened to a repetition of Wayne's report. Not a
 flicker of expression passed over his gaunt face.


 As Wayne finished, the Director asked, ""Is he armed? Anything taken
 from the ship's equipment, Captain?""


 ""Looks intact, but he probably has sidearms. All the pirates carry
 them. One funny thing, Director. The timer robot has been removed from
 the control panel. What on Callisto would he want with a loose timer?""


 ""Report back to headquarters immediately, Captain Wayne,"" Director
 Barrow ordered.


 The hum of the carrier wave died and Mart clicked off the set.
 Then, belatedly, he stood up and saluted. ""Anything I can do, sir?
 Everything's set for the freighters to clear as usual, so I'm more or
 less free—""


 Barrow nodded. ""Very good, Wells. You may go to the field and direct a
 search of the freighters. The Venusian's first thought will be to get
 away, and he may already be stowed in one of—""


 A dry voice interrupted from behind the Director's back. ""But the
 Venusian would not do anything so obvious, Director Barrow.""


 Mart whirled around. Barrow turned slowly and with dignity.


 It was the tall man dressed in the uniform of a smelting plant worker
 who had spoken. But he wasn't dark-haired any more. Still seated, he
 was smiling at them sardonically as he fanned himself with a black wig
 he had just removed. The top of his head was as smooth as a billiard
 ball, and dead white. There was a line of demarcation where the dye he
 had applied to his face came to an end.


 He had removed the tinted glasses too, and the blank-surfaced
 gray eyeballs showed why they had been worn. Now that the simple
 disguise of wig and glasses was removed, Mart noted some of the other
 distinguishing features that marked the Venusian. The general flatness
 of the face and flat unconvoluted ears. The six-fingered hands that had
 probably been thrust into the pockets of the stolen uniform.


 The Venusian glanced down at the wig and glasses. ""Standard equipment,""
 he explained. ""I always carry them in my ship and they've come in handy
 before.""


 He rose and bowed mockingly. ""My name is Tar Norn, and your supposition
 that I am a pirate is correct. But I assure you that my visit here is
 accidental and I have no designs on Comprotown.""


 Tar Norn! The most vicious and notorious of the pirates, and the most
 ruthless killer of them all. Mart hastily jerked open the drawer of
 his desk and pulled out a hand-blaster. He started the formula: ""Under
 authority of the Interplanetary Council, I arrest you, to be held for
 trial—""


 The sardonic smile did not fade from the pirate's thin lips. He rose
 and extended his arms upward. ""I am unarmed,"" he cut in. ""It will help
 our discussion if you will verify that.""


 ""—before the Supreme Council on Earth,"" Mart finished. Then, glancing
 side-wise at Director Barrow and seeing him nod, he stepped forward
 warily. Venusians, he knew, were both fast and tricky. Watching every
 move, he completed the search. Tar Norn carried no weapons.


 Why, Mart wondered, had the pirate walked openly into headquarters and
 given himself up? Obviously, Tar Norn had something up his sleeve.
 But—


 Director Barrow spoke coldly, as Mart stepped back, still covering the
 Venusian with the blaster. ""Tar Norn, you speak of 'our discussion.'
 There is nothing to discuss. You will be sent to Earth.""


 The pirate's face became vicious. ""I do not think so,"" he snapped.
 ""I have taken a hostage. It was quite dark—your tiny Callisto in
 eclipse of its huge primary—when I was forced down. But darkness means
 nothing to a Venusian. You Earthmen play a strange game with cardboard
 rectangles. To use its language, Director Barrow, I have an ace in the
 hole.""


 Tar Norn sat down again and folded his six-fingered hands quite calmly.
 Light from the ceiling overhead seemed to cast a malignant glow on his
 dead-white scalp.


 ""Your daughter, Director,"" he continued. ""If you wish to see her again,
 you will give me a ship, your
fastest
ship.""
There was a moment of dead, utter silence. Then Director Barrow leaned
 over the desk and flicked the key of the communicator. ""Control? Get
 my—get Leah Barrow at once. Ring her room. If no answer there, get my
 housekeeper. This is Director Barrow.""


 ""Your fastest ship,"" repeated the Venusian. ""Well stocked with
 supplies. Enough to take me to—to a place in the Asteroid belt. I
 shall be too late now to carry out my original plans on Ganymede.""


 The office door opened and Captain Wayne came in, followed by Roger
 Corey. Their eyes widened as they saw the Venusian. Wayne's hand darted
 toward his holster, then relaxed as he saw Mart's blaster trained on
 the pirate.


 He faced Director Barrow and saluted.


 ""Captain,"" Barrow ordered, ""you will form a search party at once—every
 available man and means. We must search all of Callisto within—"" he
 made a rapid mental calculation ""—about fifty miles. You will be
 searching for my daughter.""


 The captain stiffened. Before he could reply the carrier wave hummed
 and a feminine voice, that of an elderly woman, came over the
 communicator. ""Director Barrow? Leah isn't here. I looked in her room
 and her bed is disarranged as though she left suddenly. She always
 makes it herself as soon as she gets up.""


 ""Anything to point to when she left, Mrs. Andrews?""


 ""Not exactly, sir. The alarm was set for six and it was still buzzing.
 Her bed isn't very mussed; it looks like she got up again almost right
 after she retired. I don't understand.""


 Director Barrow's face was bleak. His voice sounded like the drip of
 water from melting ice. ""Clothing?"" he asked.


 ""Her lightweight spacesuit is gone. Apparently she put it on over her
 sleeping pajamas, for they aren't here. Is there anything I can do,
 sir? I'm worried; she hasn't ever—""


 ""That will be all, Mrs. Andrews,"" Barrow replied. ""I'll let you know if
 there is anything.""


 He turned to Captain Wayne. ""Use this set, Captain. Get Communications
 to send out a general alarm and assembly. You can make all necessary
 arrangements right here.""


 Wayne crossed to the communicator, and began to issue rapid
 instructions.


 ""Tell them to hurry,"" the Venusian cut in mockingly. ""They have until
 nine-thirty o'clock.""


 Mart Wells glanced fearfully at the dial of the chronometer. It was
 eight-forty now. He turned and caught the Director's glance. ""
The
 timer!
"" he said grimly. ""Captain Wayne said it was missing from the
 wrecked ship. He must have—""


 The Venusian was grinning. ""Exactly. The timer. And a pound of uranite.
 That gives you fifty minutes to search Callisto. It would be wiser to
 spend the time getting a ship ready for me instead.""


 The silence of the office was broken only by the low voice of Captain
 Wayne giving orders into the communicator. Abruptly he turned to his
 superior. His face was white.


 ""Search is on, sir. But if he isn't lying, there's a chance in a
 million. Less than an hour, and the area to be covered is—""


 Barrow was looking straight ahead, and not a muscle of his face moved
 until he spoke. ""I'm afraid he isn't bluffing. No reason why he should
 be. Leah is gone and the timer is gone. And a pirate ship would have
 uranite.""


 ""The ship?"" asked Tar Norn. ""It will take some time to fuel it and—""


 Director Barrow's voice was positive. ""There will be no ship for you,
 Tar Norn.""


 Roger Corey's voice cut in, jerkily. ""Let me work on him, sir. Me and
 Wayne. Maybe we can make him talk.""


 Barrow shook his head. ""No use, Corey. Venusians don't mind pain as
 much as Earthmen. They almost like it. You could take him apart, and he
 wouldn't talk.""


 The pirate's smile faded. ""It will take half an hour to prepare the
 ship, Director Barrow. Better not stall too long.""


 Mart said, his voice urgent. ""But, sir,
Leah
! What's one pirate
 compared to—""


 Barrow's face was granite-like. ""He's killed hundreds of people. If we
 release him, he'll kill hundreds more. One life cannot weigh against
 that. Corey, take him away. Lock him up until the next ship leaves for
 Earth.""


 Mart's fists were clenched, his fingernails biting into the palms. But
 he knew Barrow was right; that he couldn't possibly take any other
 course and be worthy of his post. One life couldn't weigh against the
 many lives that meeting the pirate's terms would mean. That was where
 Tar Norn had miscalculated. A Venusian didn't understand responsibility
 to society, nor any higher ideal than self-interest.


 Tar Norn tossed the wig and glasses to the floor as Corey took his arm.
 His pupil-less eyes seemed to glow with anger.


 ""You won't murder your own daughter, Director. This is a bluff. But
 mine isn't. She dies at nine-thirty unless you find her. I swear that
 by the
Eternal Varga
.""


 Mart cursed. Fists balled, he lunged toward the Venusian. Barrow put
 a hand on his arm. ""Don't, Wells. That's up to the Interplanetary
 Council.""


 ""But he's
not
bluffing,"" Mart raved. ""Leah will surely die at
 nine-thirty. That damned oath.
Varga.
It's the only thing a Venusian
 is afraid of. He isn't—"" His voice broke.


 Corey started off with the Venusian.


 Barrow said, ""Yes, he's telling the truth. But we have some time yet.
 Maybe the search—""
Mart strode to the window and looked out so the others wouldn't see his
 face. Less than three-quarters of an hour to search all of Callisto
 within a radius of fifty miles!
Through the pane he saw figures in groups of three searching the
 streets and buildings of Comprotown. That part of the search wouldn't
 be difficult. But the hills and the caves, and with only two autogiros.
 If she was there, out of sight in one of the caves, where the cruising
 ships couldn't see her....


 Her father was right, but—The picture of Leah Barrow, smiling as he
 had last seen her, seemed to blur out the view from the window. Her
 impertinent little tilted nose, the soft tempting contours of her lips,
 the deep blueness of her eyes.


 He whirled from the window and began pacing the floor, trying to
 think of something they could do that wasn't being done. Again at the
 communicator, Captain Wayne was barking questions.


 ""All available men and women are combing the town, sir,"" he reported,
 ""with orders to break down any doors that are locked, to stop at
 nothing.""


 ""And outside, Captain?""


 ""The two giros are our only real hope. But the men from the smelting
 plant are working afoot out of town. By nine-thirty they'll have
 covered a radius of about five miles.""


 Corey returned, slamming the door viciously behind him. ""Maybe we
 could trick him, sir,"" he suggested. ""Pretend we'll give him a ship if
 he'll—""


 ""A Venusian wouldn't trust his own mother,"" Barrow snapped. ""He'd
 insist on taking off first and then radioing back where she is. And
 don't think he wouldn't check the fuel tanks.""


 ""I wish you'd let me and Wayne work on him, anyway.""


 Director Barrow didn't answer.


 Mart growled, ""If Leah dies, I'm going to take that filthy pirate and—""


 Wayne's voice was bitter. ""Venusians can't help what they are. Blame
 the Earth council that sold them those ships. If they had used more
 sense, there wouldn't be a Venusian off Venus.""


 Mart nodded. If the council hadn't pulled that boner twenty years
 before, there would be no trouble with the Venusians.


 Venusians were, compared to Earth standards, a strange combination of
 genius and idiocy. Brilliant mathematicians, they had no mechanical
 ingenuity whatever. Linguists who could speak any language fluently
 after hearing it a few hours, not one of them could create a child's
 wind-up toy. Knowing the laws of leverage, they constructed their
 buildings by manual labor alone. Able to operate any machine as long as
 it was in good working order, they couldn't as much as figure out how
 to repair a clogged fuel-line.


 Even the pirates based on some of the bigger Asteroids had to depend
 upon a few renegade Earthmen to keep their ships in running order. And
 if one went blah away from base, it was a gone ship as far as they
 were concerned. Probably the trouble that had forced Tar Norn down on
 Callisto had been a minor matter that any Earthman could have taken in
 his stride. But to Tar Norn it meant a new ship or nothing.


 The thought of ships reminded him of the freighters. ""Cap,"" he asked
 Wayne, ""the freighters been searched thoroughly?""


 Wayne nodded. ""Rocket tubes and all. Even broke open the ore drums. I
 presume you'll want them to clear on schedule?""


 Director Barrow nodded. ""The crews?"" he asked. ""In the search or
 standing by?""


 ""Standing by for departure as usual, Director. A few men one way or the
 other—""


 Barrow nodded, glancing at the chronometer. Mart knew what he was
 thinking. Less than half an hour now. And, unless the searchers by some
 miracle found Leah Barrow, it would all be over before the ten o'clock
 clearance of the first freighter. And the freighters hadn't missed a
 clearance in ten years.


 The carrier wave hummed again. ""Central Communications reporting. Most
 searchers in the town have reported in. No results. Those outside
 reaching points three miles out.""


 The communicator faded. Mart clenched his fists against the futility
 of that search. Three miles! The strong Venusian, in the light gravity
 of Callisto, probably had eight or ten hours of darkness to carry his
 burden. He could easily have covered twenty to forty miles, in any
 direction. Possibly even more. And the chance of an autogiro—


 Obviously, Wayne had been thinking the same thing. ""He timed his
 arrival,"" he said bitterly. ""He gave us less than an hour. He'd
 certainly have put her outside walking range within that length of
 time. And with all the caves around, thousands of them, would he have
 put her where a giro could spot anything?""


 Mart glanced at Barrow. The Director was sitting as immobile as a
 statue. His eyes were closed and every muscle of his thin face was
 tense. Probably he was trying not to look at the chronometer on the
 wall. It was nine-fifteen.


 The office door opened and three uniformed mechanics from the field
 stood in the doorway. The foremost of them saluted. ""This entire
 building has been searched twice except this office. I presume—""


 Director Barrow opened his eyes and stood up. ""Don't presume anything.
 Search here, too.""


 The men came in and began a detailed but fruitless search. Nobody spoke
 until they left.


 The chronometer said twenty minutes after nine now. Ten minutes to go,
 if the timer had been accurately set. But could it have been set wrong?
 Venusians were lousy mechanics. Maybe—
Mart became aware that he was holding his breath for the sound of a
 distant explosion. Yes, from whatever point Tar Norn could have hidden
 his hostage, the sound of a pound of uranite exploding would carry back
 to Comprotown.


 He sat down at his desk again. In front of him were the signed
 clearance papers for the freighters. In half an hour he'd take out the
 papers for the first freighter. But before that half hour was up—


 He twisted a pencil between his fingers, held himself rigid to keep
 from turning and looking at the chronometer again. It hadn't been over
 a minute since he sat down—why torture himself by looking again? But
 each minute now seemed both a flash and an eternity.


 He turned over the sheaf of papers and drew a little square on the
 blank reverse side of the bottom one. That was Comprotown. He made a
 dot an inch or two away. That was the point where Tar Norn's ship had
 wrecked itself in landing.


 He drew a line from the point to the square. That was Tar Norn coming
 in to the town. That would have been about ten hours ago.


 Then, from the information about Callisto and Comprotown that had
 been in the papers in Tar Norn's ship, the pirate had found the home
 of the director. He would have had no trouble finding Leah's room.
 Venusians could see in the dark and walk as silently as cats. He would
 undoubtedly have drugged Leah into unconsciousness, probably without
 awakening her, since there had been no sign of a struggle. He'd put her
 into the lightweight spacesuit.


 Why? Undoubtedly it indicated that she would be outdoors. During the
 Callisto day, it would have been unnecessary. But an unconscious
 Earthwoman would freeze to death in the cold dark period of Callisto's
 eclipse behind Big Jupe.


 What then? The Venusian left, carrying her—
The Venusian had carried the drugged girl into the night.
He threw down the pencil and began to pace the room again. His muscles
 were tense from listening. How many minutes? He didn't want to know;
 dared not look.


 But Tar Norn must have planned it all before he left the wrecked ship.
 Otherwise he wouldn't have taken the timer and—


 Would he have rigged the time-bomb first, or after he had kidnapped
 Leah? And how? The timer itself would not have provided the concussion
 to set off the uranite. He'd have needed a battery, a spark-coil, and—
But Venusians weren't mechanics.
They didn't understand machines, or electricity, or even simple
 clockworks, brilliant as their strange minds were in other ways.


 Tar Norn could have set the timer all right. For that matter, he could
 calculate an orbit and make settings for space flight. But he couldn't
 have made a time-bomb, even with the timer. He couldn't have rigged
 a circuit that would set off a cap! And, Mart realized suddenly, the
 timer itself would be an electrical—not a clockwork—gadget. Once
 disconnected from the now broken dynamo of the ship, Tar Norn couldn't
 have made it run at all!


 A momentary surge of elation swept Mart. Tar Norn must have been
 bluffing! Then he remembered: a Venusian might murder his own family,
 but he would never swear to an untruth by the Eternal Varga. That one
 superstition, or religion, as they looked upon it, was binding beyond
 all else. And Tar Norn had sworn by that oath that Leah Barrows would
 die at nine-thirty unless—


 Mart looked at the chronometer. It was twenty-six minutes past nine. He
 caught a glimpse of Director Barrow's face. It looked like the face of
 a dead man. Barrow had obviously given up all hope and waited only for
 the four minutes to pass.


 The carrier wave hummed. All of them started, but the voice from the
 communicator merely reported, ""All Comprotown reports in. All negative.
 Giros report nothing. Foot parties five miles out. Reports negative.""


 Three minutes to go. Mart could see by the attitude of the others that
 they were bracing themselves for the sound of an explosion. All of them
 had liked, or loved, Leah Barrows. Mart had a momentary vision of her
 again, and remembered the electric thrill that had run through him when
 she had placed her hand on his arm, just a few days ago, and told him
 that she did care for him, well, a little anyway—


 But, if Tar Norn couldn't have rigged a time-bomb, how could he have
 arranged for Leah to die at nine-thirty?


 He saw again the corpse-like face of the Director. Yes, they had all
 been wrong in thinking that nothing mattered to Barrow more than the
 schedules—
Schedules
! There had been departure schedules among the
 papers in Tar Norn's ship. Could he have—


 With a sudden intake of breath that was almost a gasp, Mart whirled and
 ran to the communicator. The others looked at him, startled. Mart was
 yelling at the mike even before he got near enough to it to talk in a
 normal voice. ""Control! Emergency! Get
Jupe Freighter One
!
Tell him
 not to test his tubes.
Not to touch a lever!""

 Retief turned back the gold-encrusted scarlet cuff of the mess jacket
 of a First Secretary and Consul, gathered in the three eight-sided
 black dice, shook them by his right ear and sent them rattling across
 the floor to rebound from the bulk-head.


 ""Thirteen's the point,"" the Power Section Chief called. ""Ten he makes
 it!""


 ""Oh ... Mr. Retief,"" a strained voice called. Retief looked up. A tall
 thin youth in the black-trimmed gray of a Third Secretary flapped a
 sheet of paper from the edge of the circle surrounding the game. ""The
 Ambassador's compliments, sir, and will you join him and the staff in
 the conference room at once?""


 Retief rose and dusted his knees. ""That's all for now, boys,"" he said.
 ""I'll take the rest of your money later."" He followed the junior
 diplomat from the ward room, along the bare corridors of the crew
 level, past the glare panel reading NOTICE—FIRST CLASS ONLY BEYOND
 THIS POINT, through the chandeliered and draped ballroom and along a
 stretch of soundless carpet to a heavy door bearing a placard with the
 legend CONFERENCE IN SESSION.


 ""Ambassador Sternwheeler seemed quite upset, Mr. Retief,"" the messenger
 said.


 ""He usually is, Pete."" Retief took a cigar from his breast pocket. ""Got
 a light?""


 The Third Secretary produced a permatch. ""I don't know why you smoke
 those things instead of dope sticks, Mr. Retief,"" he said. ""The
 Ambassador hates the smell.""


 Retief nodded. ""I only smoke this kind at conferences. It makes for
 shorter sessions."" He stepped into the room. Ambassador Sternwheeler
 eyed him down the length of the conference table.


 ""Ah, Mr. Retief honors us with his presence. Do be seated, Retief."" He
 fingered a yellow Departmental despatch. Retief took a chair, puffing
 out a dense cloud of smoke.


 ""As I have been explaining to the remainder of my staff for the past
 quarter-hour,"" Sternwheeler rumbled, ""I've been the recipient of
 important intelligence."" He blinked at Retief expectantly. Retief
 raised his eyebrows in polite inquiry.


 ""It seems,"" Sternwheeler went on, ""that there has been a change in
 regime on Glave. A week ago, the government which invited the dispatch
 of this mission—and to which we're accredited—was overthrown.
 The former ruling class has fled into exile. A popular workers' and
 peasants' junta has taken over.""


 ""Mr. Ambassador,"" Counsellor Magnan broke in, rising. ""I'd like to be
 the first—"" he glanced around the table—""or one of the first, anyway,
 to welcome the new government of Glave into the family of planetary
 ruling bodies—""
""Sit down, Magnan!"" Sternwheeler snapped. ""Of course the Corps always
 recognizes
de facto
sovereignty. The problem is merely one of
 acquainting ourselves with the policies of this new group—a sort of
 blue-collar coalition, it seems. In what position that leaves this
 Embassy I don't yet know.""


 ""I suppose this means we'll spend the next month in a parking orbit,""
 Counsellor Magnan sighed.


 ""Unfortunately,"" Sternwheeler went on, ""the entire affair has
 apparently been carried off without recourse to violence, leaving the
 Corps no excuse to move in—that is, it appears our assistance in
 restoring order will not be required.""


 ""Glave was one of the old Contract Worlds,"" Retief said. ""What's become
 of the Planetary Manager General and the technical staff? And how do
 the peasants and workers plan to operate the atmospheric purification
 system, the Weather Control station, the tide regulation complexes?""


 ""I'm more concerned at present with the status of the Mission! Will we
 be welcomed by these peasants or peppered with buckshot?""


 ""You say that this is a popular junta, and that the former leaders have
 fled into exile,"" Retief said. ""May I ask the source?""


 ""The despatch cites a 'reliable Glavian source'.""


 ""That's officialese for something cribbed from a broadcast news
 tape. Presumably the Glavian news services are in the hands of the
 revolution. In that case—""


 ""Yes, yes, there is the possibility that the issue is yet in doubt.
 Of course we'll have to exercise caution in making our approach. It
 wouldn't do to make overtures to the wrong side.""


 ""Oh, I think we need have no fear on that score,"" the Chief of the
 Political Section spoke up. ""I know these entrenched cliques. Once
 challenged by an aroused populace, they scuttle for safety—with large
 balances safely tucked away in neutral banks.""


 ""I'd like to go on record,"" Magnan piped, ""as registering my deep
 gratification at this fulfillment of popular aspirations—""


 ""The most popular aspiration I know of is to live high off someone
 else's effort,"" Retief said. ""I don't know of anyone outside the Corps
 who's managed it.""
""Gentlemen!"" Sternwheeler bellowed. ""I'm awaiting your constructive
 suggestions—not an exchange of political views. We'll arrive off
 Glave in less than six hours. I should like before that time to have
 developed some notion regarding to whom I shall expect to offer my
 credentials!""


 There was a discreet tap at the door; it opened and the young Third
 Secretary poked his head in.


 ""Mr. Ambassador, I have a reply to your message—just received from
 Glave. It's signed by the Steward of the GFE, and I thought you'd want
 to see it at once....""


 ""Yes, of course; let me have it.""


 ""What's the GFE?"" someone asked.


 ""It's the revolutionary group,"" the messenger said, passing the message
 over.


 ""GFE? GFE? What do the letters SIGNIFY?""


 ""Glorious Fun Eternally,"" Retief suggested. ""Or possibly Goodies For
 Everybody.""


 ""I believe that's 'Glavian Free Electorate',"" the Third Secretary said.


 Sternwheeler stared at the paper, lips pursed. His face grew pink. He
 slammed the paper on the table.


 ""Well, gentlemen! It appears our worst fears have been realized!
 This is nothing less than a warning! A threat! We're advised to
 divert course and bypass Glave entirely. It seems the GFE wants no
 interference from meddling foreign exploiters, as they put it!""


 Magnan rose. ""If you'll excuse me Mr. Ambassador, I want to get off a
 message to Sector HQ to hold my old job for me—""


 ""Sit down, you idiot!"" Sternwheeler roared. ""If you think I'm
 consenting to have my career blighted—my first Ambassadorial post
 whisked out from under me—the Corps made a fool of—""


 ""I'd like to take a look at that message,"" Retief said. It was passed
 along to him. He read it.


 ""I don't believe this applies to us, Mr. Ambassador.""
""What are you talking about? It's addressed to me by name!""


 ""It merely states that 'meddling foreign exploiters' are unwelcome.
 Meddling foreigners we are, but we don't qualify as exploiters unless
 we show a profit—and this appears to be shaping up as a particularly
 profitless venture.""


 ""What are you proposing, Mr. Retief?""


 ""That we proceed to make planetfall as scheduled, greet our welcoming
 committee with wide diplomatic smiles, hint at largesse in the offing
 and settle down to observe the lie of the land.""


 ""Just what I was about to suggest,"" Magnan said.


 ""That might be dangerous,"" Sternwheeler said.


 ""That's why I didn't suggest it,"" Magnan said.


 ""Still it's essential that we learn more of the situation than can be
 gleaned from official broadcasts,"" Sternwheeler mused. ""Now, while I
 can't justify risking the entire Mission, it might be advisable to
 dispatch a delegation to sound out the new regime.""


 ""I'd like to volunteer,"" Magnan said, rising.


 ""Of course, the delegates may be murdered—""


 ""—but unfortunately, I'm under treatment at the moment."" Magnan sat
 down.


 ""—which will place us in an excellent position, propaganda-wise.


 ""What a pity I can't go,"" the Military Attache said. ""But my place is
 with my troops.""


 ""The only troops you've got are the Assistant Attache and your
 secretary,"" Magnan pointed out.


 ""Say, I'd like to be down there in the thick of things,"" the Political
 Officer said. He assumed a grave expression. ""But of course I'll be
 needed here, to interpret results.""


 ""I appreciate your attitude, gentlemen,"" Sternwheeler said, studying
 the ceiling. ""But I'm afraid I must limit the privilege of volunteering
 for this hazardous duty to those officers of more robust physique,
 under forty years of age—""


 ""Tsk. I'm forty-one,"" Magnan said.


 ""—and with a reputation for adaptability."" His glance moved along the
 table.


 ""Do you mind if I run along now, Mr. Ambassador?"" Retief said. ""It's
 time for my insulin shot.""


 Sternwheeler's mouth dropped open.


 ""Just kidding,"" Retief said. ""I'll go. But I have one request, Mr.
 Ambassador: no further communication with the ground until I give the
 all-clear.""
II


 Retief grounded the lighter, in-cycled the lock and stepped out. The
 hot yellow Glavian sun beat down on a broad expanse of concrete, an
 abandoned service cart and a row of tall ships casting black shadows
 toward the silent control tower. A wisp of smoke curled up from the
 shed area at the rim of the field. There was no other sign of life.


 Retief walked over to the cart, tossed his valise aboard, climbed
 into the driver's seat and headed for the operations building. Beyond
 the port, hills rose, white buildings gleaming against the deep green
 slopes. Near the ridge, a vehicle moved ant-like along a winding road,
 a dust trail rising behind it. Faintly a distant shot sounded.


 Papers littered the ground before the Operations Building. Retief
 pushed open the tall glass door, stood listening. Slanting sunlight
 reflected from a wide polished floor, at the far side of which
 illuminated lettering over empty counters read IMMIGRATION, HEALTH
 and CUSTOMS. He crossed to the desk, put the valise down, then leaned
 across the counter. A worried face under an oversized white cap looked
 up at him.


 ""You can come out now,"" Retief said. ""They've gone.""


 The man rose, dusting himself off. He looked over Retief's shoulder.
 ""Who's gone?""


 ""Whoever it was that scared you.""


 ""Whatta ya mean? I was looking for my pencil.""


 ""Here it is."" Retief plucked a worn stub from the pocket of the soiled
 shirt sagging under the weight of braided shoulderboards. ""You can sign
 me in as a Diplomatic Representative. A break for you—no formalities
 necessary. Where can I catch a cab for the city?""


 The man eyed Retief's bag. ""What's in that?""


 ""Personal belongings under duty-free entry.""


 ""Guns?""


 ""No, thanks, just a cab.""


 ""You got no gun?"" The man raised his voice.


 ""That's right, fellows,"" Retief called out. ""No gun; no knife, not
 even a small fission bomb. Just a few pairs of socks and some reading
 matter.""


 A brown-uniformed man ran from behind the Customs Counter, holding a
 long-barreled blast-rifle centered on the Corps insignia stitched to
 the pocket of Retief's powder-blue blazer.


 ""Don't try nothing,"" he said. ""You're under arrest.""


 ""It can't be overtime parking. I've only been here five minutes.""


 ""Hah!"" The gun-handler moved out from the counter, came up to Retief.
 ""Empty out your pockets!"" he barked. ""Hands overhead!""


 ""I'm just a diplomat, not a contortionist,"" Retief said, not moving.
 ""Do you mind pointing that thing in some other direction?""


 ""Looky here, Mister, I'll give the orders. We don't need anybody
 telling us how to run our business.""


 ""I'm telling you to shift that blaster before I take it away from you
 and wrap it around your neck,"" Retief said conversationally. The cop
 stepped back uncertainly, lowering the gun.


 ""Jake! Horny! Pud! come on out!""


 Three more brown uniforms emerged from concealment.


 ""Who are you fellows hiding from, the top sergeant?"" Retief glanced
 over the ill-fitting uniforms, the unshaved faces, the scuffed boots.
 ""Tell you what. When he shows up, I'll engage him in conversation. You
 beat it back to the barracks and grab a quick bath—""


 ""That's enough smart talk."" The biggest of the three newcomers moved
 up to Retief. ""You stuck your nose in at the wrong time. We just had a
 change of management around here.""


 ""I heard about it,"" Retief said. ""Who do I complain to?""


 ""Complain? What about?""


 ""The port's a mess,"" Retief barked. ""Nobody on duty to receive official
 visitors! No passenger service facilities! Why, do you know I had to
 carry my own bag—""


 ""All right, all right, that's outside my department. You better see the
 boss.""


 ""The boss? I thought you got rid of the bosses.""


 ""We did, but now we got new ones.""


 ""They any better than the old ones?""


 ""This guy asks too many questions,"" the man with the gun said. ""Let's
 let Sozier answer 'em.""


 ""Who's he?""


 ""He's the Military Governor of the City.""


 ""Now we're getting somewhere,"" Retief said. ""Lead the way, Jake—and
 don't forget my bag.""
Sozier was a small man with thin hair oiled across a shiny scalp,
 prominent ears and eyes like coal chips set in rolls of fat. He
 glowered at Retief from behind a polished desk occupying the center of
 a spacious office.


 ""I warned you off,"" he snapped. ""You came anyway."" He leaned forward
 and slammed a fist down on the desk. ""You're used to throwing your
 weight around, but you won't throw it around here! There'll be no spies
 pussyfooting around Glave!""


 ""Looking for what, Mr. Sozier?""


 ""Call me General!""


 ""Mind if I sit down?"" Retief pulled out a chair, seated himself and
 took out a cigar. ""Curiously enough,"" he said, lighting up, ""the Corps
 has no intention of making any embarrassing investigations. We deal
 with the existing government, no questions asked."" His eyes held the
 other's. ""Unless, of course, there are evidences of atrocities or other
 illegal measures.""


 The coal-chip eyes narrowed. ""I don't have to make explanations to you
 or anybody else.""


 ""Except, presumably, the Glavian Free Electorate,"" Retief said blandly.
 ""But tell me, General—who's actually running the show?""


 A speaker on the desk buzzed. ""Hey, Corporal Sozier! Wes's got them two
 hellions cornered. They're holed up in the Birthday Cake—""


 ""General Sozier, damn you! and plaster your big mouth shut!"" He
 gestured to one of the uniformed men standing by.


 ""You! Get Trundy and Little Moe up here—pronto!"" He swiveled back to
 Retief. ""You're in luck. I'm too busy right now to bother with you.
 You get back over to the port and leave the same way you came—and tell
 your blood-sucking friends the easy pickings are over as far as Glave's
 concerned. You won't lounge around here living high and throwing big
 parties and cooking up your dirty deals to get fat on at the expense of
 the working man.""


 Retief dribbled ash on Sozier's desk and glanced at the green uniform
 front bulging between silver buttons.


 ""Who paid for your potbelly, Sozier?"" he inquired carelessly.


 Sozier's eyes narrowed to slits. ""I could have you shot!""


 ""Stop playing games with me, Sozier,"" Retief rapped. ""There's a
 squadron of Peace Enforcers standing by just in case any apprentice
 statesmen forget the niceties of diplomatic usage. I suggest you start
 showing a little intelligence about now, or even Horny and Pud are
 likely to notice.""
Sozier's fingers squeaked on the arms of his chair. He swallowed.


 ""You might start by assigning me an escort for a conducted tour of
 the capital,"" Retief went on. ""I want to be in a position to confirm
 that order has been re-established, and that normal services have been
 restored. Otherwise it may be necessary to send in a Monitor Unit to
 straighten things out.""


 ""You know you can't meddle with the internal affairs of a sovereign
 world!""


 Retief sighed. ""The trouble with taking over your boss's job is
 discovering its drawbacks. It's disillusioning, I know, Sozier, but—""


 ""All right! Take your tour! You'll find everything running as smooth as
 silk! Utilities, police, transport, environmental control—""


 ""What about Space Control? Glave Tower seems to be off the air.""


 ""I shut it down. We don't need anything and we don't want anything from
 the outside.""


 ""Where's the new Premier keeping himself? Does he share your passion
 for privacy?""


 The general got to his feet. ""I'm letting you take your look, Mr.
 Big Nose. I'm giving you four hours. Then out! And the next meddling
 bureaucrat that tries to cut atmosphere on Glave without a clearance
 gets burned!""


 ""I'll need a car.""


 ""Jake! You stick close to this bird. Take him to the main power plant,
 the water works and the dispatch center. Ride him around town and show
 him we're doing okay without a bunch of leeches bossing us. Then dump
 him at the port—and see that he leaves.""


 ""I'll plan my own itinerary, thanks. I can't promise I'll be finished
 in four hours—but I'll keep you advised.""


 ""I warned you—""


 ""I heard you. Five times. And I only warned you once. You're getting
 ahead of me."" Retief rose, motioned to the hulking guard. ""Come on,
 Jake. We've got a lot of ground to cover before we come back for our
 dinner.""
III


 At the curb, Retief held out his hand. ""Give me the power cylinder out
 of your rifle, Jake.""


 ""Huh?""


 ""Come on, Jake. You've got a nervous habit of playing with the firing
 stud. We don't want any accidents.""


 ""How do you get it out? They only give me this thing yesterday.""


 Retief pocketed the cylinder. ""You sit in back. I'll drive."" He wheeled
 the car off along a broad avenue crowded with vehicles and lined with
 flowering palms, behind which stately white buildings reared up into
 the pale sky.


 ""Nice looking city, Jake,"" Retief said conversationally. ""What's the
 population?""


 ""I dunno. I only been here a year.""


 ""What about Horny and Pud? Are they natives?""


 ""Whatta ya mean, natives? They're just as civilized as me.""


 ""My boner, Jake. Known Sozier long?""


 ""Sure. He useta come around to the club.""


 ""I take it he was in the army under the old regime?""


 ""Yeah—but he didn't like the way they run it. Nothing but band playing
 and fancy marching. There wasn't nobody to fight.""


 ""Just between us, Jake—where did the former Planetary Manager General
 go?"" Retief watched Jake's heavy face in the mirror. Jake jumped,
 clamped his mouth shut.


 ""I don't know nothing.""


 Half an hour later, after a tour of the commercial center, Retief
 headed towards the city's outskirts. The avenue curved, leading up
 along the flank of a low hill.


 ""I must admit I'm surprised, Jake,"" Retief said. ""Everything seems
 orderly. No signs of riots or panic. Power, water, communications
 normal—just as the general said. Remarkable, isn't it, considering
 that the entire managerial class has packed up and left?""


 ""You wanta see the Power Plant?"" Retief could see perspiration beaded
 on the man's forehead under the uniform cap.


 ""Sure. Which way?"" With Jake directing, Retief ascended to the ridge
 top, cruised past the blank white facade of the station.


 ""Quiet, isn't it?"" Retief pulled the car in to the curb. ""Let's go
 inside.""


 ""Huh? Corporal Sozier didn't say nothing—""


 ""You're right, Jake. That leaves it to our discretion.""


 ""He won't like it.""


 ""The corporal's a busy man, Jake. We won't worry him by telling him
 about it.""


 Jake followed Retief up the walk. The broad double doors were locked.
 ""Let's try the back.""


 The narrow door set in the high blank wall opened as Retief approached.
 A gun barrel poked out, followed by a small man with bushy red hair. He
 looked Retief over.


 ""Who's this party, Jake?"" he barked.


 ""Sozier said show him the plant,"" Jake said.


 ""What we need is more guys to pull duty, not tourists. Anyway,
I'm
Chief Engineer here. Nobody comes in here 'less I like their looks.""
 Retief moved forward, stood looking down at the redhead. The little
 man hesitated, then waved him past. ""Lucky for you I like your looks.""
 Inside, Retief surveyed the long room, the giant converter units, the
 massive busbars. Armed men—some in uniform, some in work clothes
 or loud sport shirts—stood here and there. Other men read meters,
 adjusted controls or inspected dials.


 ""You've got more guards than workers,"" Retief said. ""Expecting trouble?""


 The redhead bit the corner from a plug of spearmint. He glanced around
 the plant. ""Things is quiet now; but you never know.""


 ""Rather old-fashioned equipment isn't it? When was it installed?""


 ""Huh? I dunno. What's wrong with it?""


 ""What's your basic power source, a core sink? Lithospheric friction?
 Sub-crustal hydraulics?""


 ""Beats me, Mister. I'm the boss here, not a dern mechanic.""
A gray-haired man carrying a clipboard walked past, studied a panel,
 made notes, glanced up to catch Retief's eye, moved on.


 ""Everything seems to be running normally,"" Retief remarked.


 ""Sure. Why not?""


 ""Records being kept up properly?""


 ""Sure. Some of these guys, all they do is walk around looking at dials
 and writing stuff on paper. If it was me, I'd put 'em to work.""


 Retief strolled over to the gray-haired man, now scribbling before a
 bank of meters. He glanced at the clipboard.
Power off at sunset. Tell Corasol
was scrawled in block letters
 across the record sheet. Retief nodded, rejoined his guard.


 ""All right, Jake. Let's have a look at the communications center.""


 Back in the car, headed west, Retief studied the blank windows of
 office buildings, the milling throngs in beer bars, shooting galleries,
 tattoo parlors, billiard halls, pinball arcades, bordellos and
 half-credit casinos.


 ""Everybody seems to be having fun,"" he remarked.


 Jake stared out the window.


 ""Yeah.""


 ""Too bad you're on duty, Jake. You could be out there joining in.""


 ""Soon as the corporal gets things organized, I'm opening me up a place
 to show dirty tri-di's. I'll get my share.""


 ""Meanwhile, let the rest of 'em have their fun, eh Jake?""


 ""Look, Mister, I been thinking. Maybe you better gimme back that
 kick-stick you taken outa my gun....""


 ""Sorry, Jake; no can do. Tell me, what was the real cause of the
 revolution? Not enough to eat? Too much regimentation?""


 ""Naw, we always got plenty to eat. There wasn't none of that
 regimentation up till I joined up in the corporal's army.""


 ""Rigid class structure, maybe? Educational discrimination?""


 Jake nodded. ""Yeah, it was them schools done it. All the time trying
 to make a feller do some kind of class. Big shots. Know it all. Gonna
 make us sit around and view tapes. Figgered they was better than us.""


 ""And Sozier's idea was you'd take over, and you wouldn't have to be
 bothered.""


 ""Aw, it wasn't Sozier's idea. He ain't the big leader.""


 ""Where does the big leader keep himself?""


 ""I dunno. I guess he's pretty busy right now."" Jake snickered. ""Some of
 them guys call themselves colonels turned out not to know nothing about
 how to shoot off the guns.""


 ""Shooting, eh? I thought it was a sort of peaceful revolution. The
 managerial class were booted out, and that was that.""


 ""I don't know nothing,"" Jake snapped. ""How come you keep trying to get
 me to say stuff I ain't supposed to talk about? You want to get me in
 trouble?""
""Oh, you're already in trouble, Jake. But if you stick with me, I'll
 try to get you out of it. Where exactly did the refugees head for? How
 did they leave? Must have been a lot of them; I'd say in a city of this
 size alone, they'd run into the thousands.""


 ""I don't know.""


 ""Of course, it depends on your definition of a big shot. Who's included
 in that category, Jake?""


 ""You know, the slick-talking ones; the fancy dressers; the guys that
 walk around and tell other guys what to do. We do all the work and they
 get all the big pay.""


 ""I suppose that would cover scientists, professional men, executives,
 technicians of all sorts, engineers, teachers—all that crowd.""


 ""Yeah, them are the ones.""


 ""And once you got them out of the way, the regular fellows would have a
 chance. Chaps that don't spend all their time taking baths and reading
 books and using big words; good Joes that don't mind picking their
 noses in public.""


 ""We got as much right as anybody—""


 ""Jake, who's Corasol?""


 ""He's—I don't know.""


 ""I thought I overheard his name somewhere.""


 ""Uh, here's the communication center,"" Jake cut in.


 Retief swung into a parking lot under a high blank facade. He set the
 brake and stepped out.


 ""Lead the way, Jake.""


 ""Look, Mister, the corporal only wanted me to show you the outside.""


 ""Anything to hide, Jake?""


 Jake shook his head angrily and stamped past Retief. ""When I joined up
 with Sozier, I didn't figger I'd be getting in this kind of mess.""


 ""I know, Jake. It's tough. Sometimes it seems like a fellow works
 harder after he's thrown out the parasites than he did before.""


 A cautious guard let Retief and Jake inside, followed them along
 bright-lit aisles among consoles, cables, batteries of instruments.
 Armed men in careless uniforms lounged, watching. Here and there a
 silent technician worked quietly.


 Retief paused by one, an elderly man in a neat white coverall, with a
 purple spot under one eye.


 ""Quite a bruise you've got there,"" Retief commented heartily. ""Power
 failure at sunset,"" he added softly. The technician hesitated, nodded
 and moved on.


 Back in the car, Retief gave Jake directions. At the end of three
 hours, he had seen twelve smooth-running, heavily guarded installations.


 ""So far, so good, Jake,"" he said. ""Next stop, Sub-station Number Nine.""
 In the mirror, Jake's face stiffened. ""Hey, you can't go down there—""


 ""Something going on there, Jake?""


 ""That's where—I mean, no. I don't know.""


 ""I don't want to miss anything, Jake. Which way?""


 ""I ain't going down there,"" Jake said sullenly.


 Retief braked. ""In that case, I'm afraid our association is at an end,
 Jake.""


 ""You mean ... you're getting out here?""


 ""No, you are.""


 ""Huh? Now wait a minute, Mister! The corporal said I was to stay with
 you.""


 Retief accelerated. ""That's settled, then. Which way?""
IV


 Retief pulled the car to a halt two hundred yards from the periphery
 of a loose crowd of brown-uniformed men who stood in groups scattered
 across a broad plaza, overflowing into a stretch of manicured lawn
 before the bare, functional facade of sub-station number Nine. In the
 midst of the besieging mob, Sozier's red face and bald head bobbed as
 he harangued a cluster of green-uniformed men from his place in the
 rear of a long open car.


 ""What's it all about, Jake?"" Retief enquired. ""Since the parasites have
 all left peacefully, I'm having a hard time figuring out who'd be holed
 up in the pumping station—and why. Maybe they haven't gotten the word
 that it's all going to be fun and games from now on.""


 ""If the corporal sees you over here—""


 ""Ah, the good corporal. Glad you mentioned him, Jake. He's the man to
 see."" Retief stepped out of the car and started through the crowd. A
 heavy lorry loaded with an immense tank with the letter H blazoned on
 its side trundled into the square from a side street, moved up to a
 position before the building. A smaller car pulled alongside Sozier's
 limousine. The driver stepped down, handed something to Sozier. A
 moment later, Sozier's amplified voice boomed across the crowd.


 ""You in there, Corasol! This is General Sozier, and I'm warning you to
 come out now or you and your smart friends are in for a big surprise.
 You think I won't blast you out because I don't want to wreck the
 planet. You see the tank aboard the lorry that just pulled up? It's
 full of gas—and I got plenty of hoses out here to pump it inside with.
 I'll put men on the roof and squirt it in the ventilators.""


 Sozier's voice echoed and died. The militiamen eyed the station.
 Nothing happened.


 ""I know you can hear me, damn you!"" Sozier squalled. ""You'd better get
 the doors open and get out here fast!""


 Retief stepped to Sozier's side. ""Say, Corporal, I didn't know you went
 in for practical jokes.""


 Sozier jerked around to gape at Retief.


 ""What are you doing here!"" he burst out. ""I told Jake—where is that—""


 ""Jake didn't like the questions I was asking,"" Retief said, ""so he
 marched me up here to report to you.""


 ""Jake, you damn fool!"" Sozier roared. ""I got a good mind—""
""I disagree, Sozier,"" Retief cut in. ""I think you're a complete
 imbecile. Sitting out here in the open yelling at the top of your
 lungs, for example. Corasol and his party might get annoyed and spray
 that fancy car you've swiped with something a lot more painful than
 words.""


 ""Eh?"" Sozier's head whipped around to stare at the building.


 ""Isn't that a gun I see sticking out?""


 Sozier dropped. ""Where?""


 ""My mistake. Just a foreign particle on my contact lenses."" Retief
 leaned on the car. ""On the other hand, Sozier, most murderers are
 sneaky about it. I think making a public announcement is a nice gesture
 on your part. The Monitors won't have any trouble deciding who to hang
 when they come in to straighten out this mess.""


 Sozier scrambled back onto his seat. ""Monitors?"" he snarled. ""I
 don't think so. I don't think you'll be around to do any blabbering
 to anybody."" He raised his voice. ""Jake! March this spy over to the
 sidelines. If he tries anything, shoot him!"" He gave Retief a baleful
 grin. ""I'll lay the body out nice and ship it back to your cronies.
 Accidents will happen, you know. It'll be a week or two before they get
 around to following up—and by then I'll have this little problem under
 control.""


 Jake looked at Retief uncertainly, fingering his empty rifle.


 Retief put his hands up. ""I guess you got me, Jake,"" he said. ""Careful
 of that gun, now.""


 Jake glanced at Sozier, gulped, aimed the rifle at Retief and nodded
 toward the car. As Retief moved off, a murmur swept across the crowd.
 Retief glanced back. A turret on the station roof was rotating slowly.
 A shout rose; men surged away from the building, scuffling for way;
 Sozier yelled. His car started up, moved forward, horns blaring. As
 Retief watched, a white stream arced up from the turret, catching the
 sun as it spanned the lawn, plunged down to strike the massed men in a
 splatter of spray. It searched across the mob, came to rest on Sozier's
 car. Uniformed men scrambled for safety as the terrified driver gunned
 the heavy vehicle. The hose followed the car, dropping a solid stream
 of water on Sozier, kicking and flailing in the back seat. As the car
 passed from view, down a side street, water was overflowing the sides.


 ""The corporal will feel all the better for an invigorating swim in
 his mobile pool,"" Retief commented. ""By the way, Jake, I have to be
 going now. It wouldn't be fair to send you back to your boss without
 something to back up your story that you were outnumbered, so—""


 Retief's left fist shot out to connect solidly with Jake's jaw. Jake
 dropped the gun and sat down hard. Retief turned and headed for the
 pumping station. The hose had shut down now. A few men were standing,
 eyeing the building anxiously. Others watched his progress across the
 square. As Retief passed, he caught scattered comments:


 ""—seen that bird before.""


 ""—where he's headed.""


 ""—feller Sozier was talking to....""


 ""Hey, you!""


 Retief was on the grass now. Ahead, the blank wall loomed up. He walked
 on briskly.


 ""Stop that jasper!"" a shout rang out. There was a sharp whine and a
 black spot appeared on the wall ahead. Near it, a small personnel door
 abruptly swung inward. Retief sprinted, plunged through the opening
 as a second shot seared the paint on the doorframe. The door clanged
 behind him. Retief glanced over the half dozen men confronting him.


 ""I'm Retief, CDT, acting Charge,"" he said. ""Which of you gentlemen is

THE VERY SECRET AGENT
BY MARI WOLF
Illustrated by Ed Emsh
Poor Riuku!... Not being a member of the human race, how
 was he supposed to understand what goes on in a woman's mind
 when the male of the same species didn't even know?
In their ship just beyond the orbit of Mars the two aliens sat looking
 at each other.


 ""No,"" Riuku said. ""I haven't had any luck. And I can tell you right
 now that I'm not going to have any, and no one else is going to have
 any either. The Earthmen are too well shielded.""


 ""You contacted the factory?"" Nagor asked.


 ""Easily. It's the right one. The parking lot attendant knows there's a
 new weapon being produced in there. The waitress at the Jumbo Burger
 Grill across the street knows it. Everybody I reached knows it. But
 not one knows anything about what it is.""


 Nagor looked out through the ports of the spaceship, which didn't in
 the least resemble an Earth spaceship, any more than what Nagor
 considered sight resembled the corresponding Earth sense perception.
 He frowned.


 ""What about the research scientists? We know who some of them are. The
 supervisors? The technicians?""


 ""No,"" Riuku said flatly. ""They're shielded. Perfectly I can't make
 contact with a single mind down there that has the faintest inkling of
 what's going on. We never should have let them develop the shield.""


 ""Have you tried contacting everyone? What about the workers?""


 ""Shielded. All ten thousand of them. Of course I haven't checked all
 of them yet, but—""


 ""Do it,"" Nagor said grimly. ""We've got to find out what that weapon
 is. Or else get out of this solar system.""


 Riuku sighed. ""I'll try,"" he said.
Someone put another dollar in the juke box, and the theremins started
 in on Mare Indrium Mary for the tenth time since Pete Ganley had come
 into the bar. ""Aw shut up,"" he said, wishing there was some way to
 turn them off. Twelve-ten. Alice got off work at Houston's at twelve.
 She ought to be here by now. She would be, if it weren't Thursday.
 Shield boosting night for her.


 Why, he asked himself irritably, couldn't those scientists figure out
 some way to keep the shields up longer than a week? Or else why didn't
 they have boosting night the same for all departments? He had to stay
 late every Friday and Alice every Thursday, and all the time there was
 Susan at home ready to jump him if he wasn't in at a reasonable
 time....


 ""Surprised, Pete?"" Alice Hendricks said at his elbow.


 He swung about, grinned at her. ""Am I? You said it. And here I was
 about to go. I never thought you'd make it before one."" His grin faded
 a little. ""How'd you do it? Sweet-talk one of the guards into letting
 you in at the head of the line?""


 She shook her bandanaed head, slid onto the stool beside him and
 crossed her knees—a not very convincing sign of femininity in a woman
 wearing baggy denim coveralls. ""Aren't you going to buy me a drink,
 honey?""


 ""Oh, sure."" He glanced over at the bartender. ""Another beer. No, make
 it two."" He pulled the five dollars out of his pocket, shoved it
 across the bar, and looked back at Alice, more closely this time. The
 ID badge, pinned to her hip. The badge, with her name, number,
 department, and picture—and the little meter that measured the
 strength of her Mind Shield.


 The dial should have pointed to full charge. It didn't. It registered
 about seventy per cent loss.


 Alice followed his gaze. She giggled. ""It was easy,"" she said. ""The
 guards don't do more than glance at us, you know. And everyone who's
 supposed to go through Shielding on Thursday has the department number
 stamped on a yellow background. So all I did was make a red
 background, like yours, and slip it on in the restroom at Clean-up
 time.""


 ""But Alice...."" Pete Ganley swallowed his beer and signaled for
 another. ""This is serious. You've got to keep the shields up. The
 enemy is everywhere. Why, right now, one could be probing you.""


 ""So what? The dial isn't down to Danger yet. And tomorrow I'll just
 put the red tag back on over the yellow one and go through Shielding
 in the same line with you. They won't notice."" She giggled again. ""I
 thought it was smart, Petey. You oughta think so too. You know why I
 did it, don't you?""


 Her round, smooth face looked up at him, wide-eyed and full-lipped.
 She had no worry wrinkles like Susan's, no mouth pulled down at the
 corners like Susan's, and under that shapeless coverall....


 ""Sure, baby, I'm glad you did it,"" Pete Ganley said huskily.


 Riuku was glad too, the next afternoon when the swing shift started
 pouring through the gates.


 It was easy, once he'd found her. He had tested hundreds, all
 shielded, some almost accessible to him, but none vulnerable enough.
 Then this one came. The shield was so far down that contact was almost
 easy. Painful, tiring, but not really difficult. He could feel her
 momentary sense of alarm, of nausea, and then he was through,
 integrated with her, his thoughts at home with her thoughts.


 He rested, inside her mind.


 ""Oh, hi, Joan. No, I'm all right. Just a little dizzy for a moment. A
 hangover? Of course not. Not on a Friday.""


 Riuku listened to her half of the conversation. Stupid Earthman. If
 only she'd start thinking about the job. Or if only his contact with
 her were better. If he could use her sense perceptions, see through
 her eyes, hear through her ears, feel through her fingers, then
 everything would be easy. But he couldn't. All he could do was read
 her thoughts. Earth thoughts at that....
... The time clock. Where's my card? Oh, here it is. Only 3:57. Why
 did I have to hurry so? I had lots of time....
""Why, Mary, how nice you look today. That's a new hairdo, isn't it? A
 permanent? Yeah, what kind?""
... What a microbe! Looks like pink
 straw, her hair does, and of course she thinks it's beautiful....
""I'd better get down to my station. Old Liverlips will be ranting
 again. You oughta be glad you have Eddie for a lead man. Eddie's cute.
 So's Dave, over in 77. But Liverlips, ugh....""


 She was walking down the aisle to her station now. A procession of
 names:
Maisie, and Edith, and that fat slob Natalie, and if Jean
 Andrews comes around tonight flashing that diamond in my face again,
 I'll—I'll kill her....
""Oh hello, Clinton. What do you mean, late? The whistle just blew. Of
 course I'm ready to go to work.""
Liverlips, that's what you are. And
 still in that same blue shirt. What a wife you must have. Probably as
 sloppy as you are....
Good, Riuku thought. Now she'll be working. Now he'd find out whatever
 it was she was doing. Not that it would be important, of course, but
 let him learn what her job was, and what those other girls' jobs were,
 and in a little while he'd have all the data he needed. Maybe even
 before the shift ended tonight, before she went through the Shielding
 boost.


 He shivered a little, thinking of the boost. He'd survive it, of
 course. He'd be too well integrated with her by then. But it was
 nothing to look forward to.


 Still, he needn't worry about it. He had the whole shift to find out
 what the weapon was. The whole shift, here inside Alice's mind, inside
 the most closely guarded factory on or under or above the surface of
 the Earth. He settled down and waited, expectantly.


 Alice Hendricks turned her back on the lead man and looked down the
 work table to her place. The other girls were there already. Lois and
 Marge and Coralie, the other three members of the Plug table, Line 73.


 ""Hey, how'd you make out?"" Marge said. She glanced around to make sure
 none of the lead men or timekeepers were close enough to overhear her,
 then went on. ""Did you get away with it?""


 ""Sure,"" Alice said. ""And you should of seen Pete's face when I walked
 in.""


 She took the soldering iron out of her locker, plugged it in, and
 reached out for the pan of 731 wires. ""You know, it's funny. Pete's
 not so good looking, and he's sort of a careless dresser and all that,
 but oh, what he does to me."" She filled the 731 plug with solder and
 reached for the white, black, red wire.


 ""You'd better watch out,"" Lois said. ""Or Susan's going to be doing
 something to you.""


 ""Oh, her."" Alice touched the tip of the iron to the solder filled pin,
 worked the wire down into position. ""What can she do? Pete doesn't
 give a damn about her.""


 ""He's still living with her, isn't he?"" Lois said.


 Alice shrugged....
What a mealy-mouthed little snip Lois could be,
 sometimes. You'd think to hear her that she was better than any of
 them, and luckier too, with her Joe and the kids. What a laugh! Joe
 was probably the only guy who'd ever looked at her, and she'd hooked
 him right out of school, and now with three kids in five years and her
 working nights....
Alice finished soldering the first row of wires in the plug and
 started in on the second. So old Liverlips thought she wasted time,
 did he? Well, she'd show him. She'd get out her sixteen plugs tonight.


 ""Junior kept me up all night last night,"" Lois said. ""He's cutting a
 tooth.""


 ""Yeah,"" Coralie said, ""It's pretty rough at that age. I remember right
 after Mike was born....""


 Don't they ever think of anything but their kids? Alice thought. She
 stopped listening to them. She heard Pete's voice again, husky and
 sending little chills all through her, and his face came between her
 and the plug and the white green wire she was soldering. His face,
 with those blue eyes that went right through a girl and that little
 scar that quirked up the corner of his mouth....


 ""Oh, oh,"" Alice said suddenly. ""I've got solder on the outside of the
 pin."" She looked around for the alcohol.


 Riuku probed. Her thoughts were easy enough to read, but just try to
 translate them into anything useful.... He probed deeper. The plugs
 she was soldering. He could get a good picture of them, of the wires,
 of the harness lacing that Coralie was doing. But it meant nothing.
 They could be making anything. Radios, monitor units, sound equipment.


 Only they weren't. They were making a weapon, and this bit of
 electronic equipment was part of that weapon. What part? What did the
 731 plug do?


 Alice Hendricks didn't know. Alice Hendricks didn't care.


 The first break. Ten minutes away from work. Alice was walking back
 along the aisle that separated Assembly from the men's Machine Shop. A
 chance, perhaps. She was looking at the machines, or rather past them,
 at the men.


 ""Hello, Tommy. How's the love life?"" He's not bad at all. Real cute.
 Though not like Pete, oh no.


 The machines. Riuku prodded at her thoughts, wishing he could
 influence them, wishing that just for a moment he could see, hear,
 feel,
think
as she would never think.


 The machines were—machines. That big funny one where Ned works, and
 Tommy's spot welder, and over in the corner where the superintendent
 is—he's a snappy dresser, tie and everything.


 The corner. Restricted area. Can't go over. High voltage or
 something....


 Her thoughts slid away from the restricted area. Should she go out for
 lunch or eat off the sandwich machine? And Riuku curled inside her
 mind and cursed her with his rapidly growing Earthwoman's vocabulary.


 At the end of the shift he had learned nothing. Nothing about the
 weapon, that is. He had found out a good deal about the sex life of
 Genus Homo—information that made him even more glad than before that
 his was a one-sexed race.
With work over and tools put away and Alice in the restroom gleefully
 thinking about the red Friday night tag she was slipping onto her ID
 badge, he was as far from success as ever. For a moment he considered
 leaving her, looking for another subject. But he'd probably not be
 able to find one. No, the only thing to do was stay with her, curl
 deep in her mind and go through the Shielding boost, and later on....


 The line. Alice's nervousness....
Oh, oh, there's that guy with the
 meter—the one from maintenance. What's he want?
""Whaddya mean, my shield's low? How could it be?""
... If he checks
 the tag I'll be fired for sure. It's a lot of nonsense anyway. The
 enemy is everywhere, they keep telling us. Whoever saw one of them?
""No, honest, I didn't notice anything. Can I help it if.... It's okay,
 huh? It'll pass....""


 Down to fifteen per cent, the guy said. Well, that's safe, I guess.
 Whew.


 ""Oh, hello, Paula. Whatcha talking about, what am I doing here
 tonight? Shut up....""


 And then, in the midst of her thoughts, the pain, driving deep into
 Riuku, twisting at him, wrenching at him, until there was no
 consciousness of anything at all.


 He struggled back. He was confused, and there was blankness around
 him, and for a moment he thought he'd lost contact altogether. Then he
 came into focus again. Alice's thoughts were clearer than ever
 suddenly. He could feel her emotions; they were a part of him now. He
 smiled. The Shielding boost had helped him. Integration—much more
 complete integration than he had ever known before.


 ""But Pete, honey,"" Alice said. ""What did you come over to the gate
 for? You shouldn't of done it.""


 ""Why not? I wanted to see you.""


 ""What if one of Susan's pals sees us?""


 ""So what? I'm getting tired of checking in every night, like a baby.
 Besides, one of her pals did see us, last night, at the bar.""
Fear. What'll she do? Susan's a hellcat. I know she is. But maybe
 Pete'll get really sick and tired of her. He looks it. He looks mad.
 I'd sure hate to have him mad at me....
""Let's go for a spin, baby. Out in the suburbs somewhere. How about
 it?""


 ""Well—why sure, Pete....""


 Sitting beside him in the copter.
All alone up here. Real romantic,
 like something on the video. But I shouldn't with him married, and all
 that. It's not right. But it's different, with Susan such a mean
 thing. Poor Petey....
Riuku prodded. He found it so much easier since the Shielding boost.
 If only these Earthmen were more telepathic, so that they could be
 controlled directly. Still, perhaps with this new integration he could
 accomplish the same results. He prodded again.


 ""Pete,"" Alice said suddenly. ""What are we working on, anyway?""


 ""What do you mean, working on?"" He frowned at her.


 ""At the plant. All I ever do is sit there soldering plugs, and no one
 ever tells me what for.""


 ""Course not. You're not supposed to talk about any part of the job
 except your own. You know that. The slip of a lip—""


 ""Can cost Earth a ship. I know. Quit spouting poster talk at me, Pete
 Ganley. The enemy isn't even human. And there aren't any around here.""


 Pete looked over at her. She was pouting, the upper lip drawn under
 the lower. Someone must have told her that was cute. Well, so what—it
 was cute.


 ""What makes you think I know anything more than you do?"" he said.


 ""Well, gee."" She looked up at him, so near to her in the moonlight
 that she wondered why she wanted to talk about the plant anyway.
 ""You're in Final Assembly, aren't you? You check the whatsits before
 they go out.""


 ""Sure,"" he said. No harm in telling her. No spies now, not in this
 kind of war. Besides, she was too dumb to know anything.


 ""It's a simple enough gadget,"" Pete Ganley said. ""A new type of force
 field weapon that the enemy can't spot until it hits them. They don't
 even know there's an Earth ship within a million miles, until
Bingo
!...""


 She drank it in, and in her mind Riuku did too. Wonderful integration,
 wonderful. Partial thought control. And now, he'd learn the secret....


 ""You really want to know how it works?"" Pete Ganley said. When she
 nodded he couldn't help grinning. ""Well, it's analogous to the field
 set up by animal neurones, in a way. You've just got to damp that
 field, and not only damp it but blot it out, so that the frequency
 shows nothing at all there, and then—well, that's where those
 Corcoran assemblies you're soldering on come in. You produce the
 field....""


 Alice Hendricks listened. For some reason she wanted to listen. She
 was really curious about the field. But, gee, how did he expect her to
 understand all that stuff? He sounded like her algebra teacher, or was
 it chemistry? Lord, how she'd hated school. Maybe she shouldn't have
 quit.
... Corcoran fields. E and IR and nine-space something or other.
 She'd never seen Pete like this before. He looked real different. Sort
 of like a professor, or something. He must be real smart. And
 so—well, not good-looking especially but, well, appealing. Real SA,
 he had....
""So that's how it works,"" Pete Ganley said. ""Quite a weapon, against
 them. It wouldn't work on a human being, of course."" She was staring
 at him dreamy-eyed. He laughed. ""Silly, I bet you haven't understood a
 word I said.""


 ""I have too.""


 ""Liar."" He locked the automatic pilot on the copter and held out his
 arms. ""Come here, you.""


 ""Oh, Petey....""


 Who cared about the weapon? He was right, even if she wouldn't admit
 it. She hadn't even listened, hardly. She hadn't understood.


 And neither had Riuku.
Riuku waited until she'd fallen soundly asleep that night before he
 tried contacting Nagor. He'd learned nothing useful. He'd picked up
 nothing in her mind except more thoughts of Pete, and gee, maybe
 someday they'd get married, if he only had guts enough to tell Susan
 where to get off....


 But she was asleep at last. Riuku was free enough of her thoughts to
 break contact, partially of course, since if he broke it completely he
 wouldn't be able to get back through the Shielding. It was hard enough
 to reach out through it. He sent a painful probing feeler out into
 space, to the spot where Nagor and the others waited for his report.


 ""Nagor....""


 ""Riuku? Is that you?""


 ""Yes. I've got a contact. A girl. But I haven't learned anything yet
 that can help us.""


 ""Louder, Riuku. I can hardly hear you....""


 Alice Hendricks stirred in her sleep. The dream images slipped through
 her subconscious, almost waking her, beating against Riuku.


 Pete, baby, you shouldn't be like that....


 Riuku cursed the bisexual species in their own language.


 ""Riuku!"" Nagor's call was harsh, urgent. ""You've got to find out. We
 haven't much time. We lost three more ships today, and there wasn't a
 sign of danger. No Earthman nearby, no force fields, nothing. You've
 got to find out why."" Those ships just disappeared.


 Riuku forced his way up through the erotic dreams of Alice Hendricks.
 ""I know a little,"" he said. ""They damp their thought waves somehow,
 and keep us from spotting the Corcoran field.""


 ""Corcoran field? What's that?""


 ""I don't know."" Alice's thoughts washed over him, pulling him back
 into complete integration, away from Nagor, into a medley of heroic
 Petes with gleaming eyes and clutching hands and good little Alices
 pushing them away—for the moment.


 ""But surely you can find out through the girl,"" Nagor insisted from
 far away, almost out of phase altogether.


 ""No, Pete!"" Alice Hendricks said aloud.


 ""Riuku, you're the only one of us with any possible sort of contact.
 You've got to find out, if we're to stay here at all.""


 ""Well,"" Alice Hendricks thought, ""maybe....""


 Riuku cursed her again, in the lingua franca of a dozen systems.
 Nagor's voice faded. Riuku switched back to English.
Saturday. Into the plant at 3:58. Jean's diamond again....
Wish it
 would choke her; she's got a horsey enough face for it to. Where's old
 Liverlips? Don't see him around. Might as well go to the restroom for
 a while....
That's it, Riuku thought. Get her over past the machine shop, over by
 that Restricted Area. There must be something there we can go on....


 ""Hello, Tommy,"" Alice Hendricks said. ""How's the love life?""


 ""It could be better if someone I know would, uh, cooperate....""


 She looked past him, toward the corner where the big panels were with
 all the dials and the meters and the chart that was almost like the
 kind they drew pictures of earthquakes on. What was it for, anyway?
 And why couldn't anyone go over to it except those longhairs? High
 voltage her foot....


 ""What're you looking at, Alice?"" Tommy said.


 ""Oh, that."" She pointed. ""Wonder what it's for? It doesn't look like
 much of anything, really.""


 ""I wouldn't know. I've got something better to look at.""


 ""Oh,
you
!""


 Compared to Pete, he didn't have anything, not anything at all.


 ...
Pete. Gee, he must have got home awful late last night. Wonder
 what Susan said to him. Why does he keep taking her lip, anyway?
Riuku waited. He prodded. He understood the Restricted Area as she
 understood it—which was not at all. He found out some things about
 the 731 plugs—that a lot of them were real crummy ones the fool day
 shift girls had set up wrong, and besides she'd rather solder on the
 717's any day. He got her talking about the weapon again, and he found
 out what the other girls thought about it.


 Nothing.


 Except where else could you get twelve-fifty an hour soldering?


 She was stretched out on the couch in the restroom lobby taking a
 short nap—on company time, old Liverlips being tied up with the new
 girls down at the other end of the line—when Riuku finally managed to
 call Nagor again.


 ""Have you found out anything, Riuku?""


 ""Not yet.""


 Silence. Then: ""We've lost another ship. Maybe you'd better turn her
 loose and come on back. It looks as if we'll have to run for it, after
 all.""


 Defeat. The long, interstellar search for another race, a race less
 technologically advanced than this one, and all because of a stupid
 Earth female.


 ""Not yet, Nagor,"" he said. ""Her boy friend knows. I'll find out. I'll
 make her listen to him.""


 ""Well,"" Nagor said doubtfully. ""All right. But hurry. We haven't much
 time at all.""


 ""I'll hurry,"" Riuku promised. ""I'll be back with you tonight.""


 That night after work Pete Ganley was waiting outside the gate again.
 Alice spotted his copter right away, even though he had the lights
 turned way down.


 ""Gee, Pete, I didn't think....""


 ""Get in. Quick.""


 ""What's the matter?"" She climbed in beside him. He didn't answer until
 the copter had lifted itself into the air, away from the factory
 landing lots and the bright overhead lights and the home-bound
 workers.


 ""It's Susan, who else,"" he said grimly. ""She was really sounding off
 today. She kept saying she had a lot of evidence and I'd better be
 careful. And, well, I sure didn't want you turning up at the bar
 tonight of all nights.""


 He didn't sound like Pete.


 ""Why?"" Alice said. ""Are you afraid she'll divorce you?""


 ""Oh, Alice, you're as bad as—look, baby, don't you see? It would be
 awful for you. All the publicity, the things she'd call you, maybe
 even in the papers....""


 He was staring straight ahead, his hands locked about the controls. He
 was sort of—well, distant. Not her Petey any more. Someone else's
 Pete. Susan's Pete....


 ""I think we should be more careful,"" he said.


 Riuku twisted his way through her thoughts, tried to push them
 down....
Does he love me, he's got to love me, sure he does, he just
 doesn't want me to get hurt....
And far away, almost completely out of phase, Nagor's call. ""Riuku,
 another ship's gone. You'd better come back. Bring what you've learned
 so far and we can withdraw from the system and maybe piece it
 together....""


 ""In a little while. Just a little while."" Stop thinking about Susan,
 you biological schizo. Change the subject. You'll never get anything
 out of that man by having hysterics....


 ""I suppose,"" Alice cried bitterly, ""you've been leading me on all the
 time. You don't love me. You'd rather have
her
!""


 ""That's not so. Hell, baby....""
He's angry. He's not even going to kiss me. I'm just cutting my own
 throat when I act like that....
""Okay, Pete. I'm sorry. I know it's tough on you. Let's have a drink,
 okay? Still got some in the glove compartment?""


 ""Huh? Oh, sure.""


 She poured two drinks, neat, and he swallowed his with one impatient
 gulp. She poured him another.
Riuku prodded. The drink made his job easier. Alice's thoughts calmed,
 swirled away from Susan and what am I going to do and why didn't I
 pick up with some single guy, anyway? A single guy, like Tommy maybe.
 Tommy and his spot welder, over there by the Restricted Area. The
 Restricted Area....


 ""Pete.""


 ""Yeah, baby?""


 ""How come they let so much voltage loose in the plant, so we can't
 even go over in the Restricted Area?""


 ""Whatever made you think of that?"" He laughed suddenly. He turned to
 her, still laughing. He was the old Pete again, she thought, with his
 face happy and his mouth quirked up at the corner. ""Voltage loose ...
 oh, baby, baby. Don't you know what that is?""


 ""No. What?""


 ""That's the control panel for one of the weapons, silly. It's only a
 duplicate, actually—a monitor station. But it's tuned to the
 frequencies of all the ships in this sector and—""


 She listened. She wanted to listen. She had to want to listen, now.


 ""Nagor, I'm getting it,"" Riuku called. ""I'll bring it all back with
 me. Just a minute and I'll have it.""


 ""How does it work, honey?"" Alice Hendricks said.


 ""You really want to know? Okay. Now the Corcoran field is generated
 between the ships and areas like that one, only a lot more powerful,
 by—""


 ""It's coming through now, Nagor.""


 ""—a very simple power source, once you get the basics of it. You—oh,
 oh!"" He grabbed her arm. ""Duck, Alice!""


 A spotlight flashed out of the darkness, turned on them, outlined
 them. A siren whirred briefly, and then another copter pulled up
 beside them and a loudspeaker blared tinnily.


 ""Okay, bud, pull down to the landing lane.""


 The police.


 Police. Fear, all the way through Alice's thoughts, all the way
 through Riuku. Police. Earth law. That meant—it must mean he'd been
 discovered, that they had some other means of protection besides the
 Shielding....


 ""Nagor! I've been discovered!""


 ""Come away then, you fool!""


 He twisted, trying to pull free of Alice's fear, away from the
 integration of their separate terrors. But he couldn't push her
 thoughts back from his. She was too frightened. He was too frightened.
 The bond held.


 ""Oh, Pete, Pete, what did you do?""


 He didn't answer. He landed the copter, stepped out of it, walked back
 to the other copter that was just dropping down behind him. ""But
 officer, what's the matter?""


 Alice Hendricks huddled down in the seat, already seeing tomorrow's
 papers, and her picture, and she wasn't really photogenic, either....
 And then, from the other copter, she heard the woman laugh.


 ""Pete Ganley, you fall for anything, don't you?""


 ""Susan!""


 ""You didn't expect me to follow you, did you? Didn't it ever occur to
 you that detectives could put a bug in your copter? My, what we've
 been hearing!""


 ""Yeah,"" the detective who was driving said. ""And those pictures we
 took last night weren't bad either.""


 ""Susan, I can explain everything....""


 ""I'm sure you can, Pete. You always try. But as for you—you little—""


 Alice ducked down away from her. Pictures. Oh God, what it would make
 her look like. Still, this hag with the pinched up face who couldn't
 hold a man with all the cosmetics in the drugstore to camouflage
 her—she had her nerve, yelling like that.


 ""Yeah, and I know a lot about you too!"" Alice Hendricks cried.


 ""Why, let me get my hands on you....""


 ""Riuku!""


 Riuku prodded. Calm down, you fool. You're not gaining anything this
 way. Calm down, so I can get out of here....


 Alice Hendricks stopped yelling abruptly.


 ""That's better,"" Susan said. ""Pete, your taste in women gets worse
 each time. I don't know why I always take you back.""


 ""I can explain everything.""


 ""Oh, Pete,"" Alice Hendricks whispered. ""Petey, you're not—""


 ""Sure he is,"" Susan Ganley said. ""He's coming with me. The nice
 detectives will take you home, dear. But I don't think you'd better
 try anything with them—they're not your type. They're single.""


 ""Pete...."" But he wouldn't meet Alice's eyes. And when Susan took his
 arm, he followed her.


 ""How could you do it, Petey...."" Numb whispers, numb thoughts, over
 and over, but no longer frightened, no longer binding on Riuku.


 Fools, he thought. Idiotic Earthmen. If it weren't for your ridiculous
 reproductive habits I'd have found out everything. As it is....
 ""Nagor, I'm coming! I didn't get anything. This woman—""


 ""Well, come on then. We're leaving. Right now. There'll be other
 systems.""
Petey, Petey, Petey....
Contact thinned as he reached out away from her, toward Nagor, toward
 the ship. He fought his way out through the Shielding, away from her
 and her thoughts and every detestable thing about her. Break free,
 break free....


 ""What's the matter, Riuku? Why don't you come? Have the police caught
 you?""


 The others were fleeing, getting farther away even as he listened to
 Nagor's call. Contact was hard to maintain now; he could feel
 communication fading.


 ""Riuku, if you don't come now....""


 He fought, but Alice's thoughts were still with him; Alice's tears
 still kept bringing him back into full awareness of her.


 ""Riuku!""


 ""I—I can't!""


 The Shielding boost, that had integrated him so completely with Alice
 Hendricks, would never let him go.


 ""Oh, Petey, I've lost you....""


 And Nagor's sad farewell slipped completely out of phase, leaving him
 alone, with her.


 The plant. The Restricted Area. The useless secret of Earth's now
 unneeded weapon. Alice Hendricks glancing past it, at the spot welding
 machine, at Tommy.


 ""How's the love life?""


 ""You really interested in finding out, Alice?""


 ""Well—maybe—""


 And Riuku gibbered unheard in her mind.

A strange destiny had erased Noork's memory,

 and had brought him to this tiny world—to

 write an end to his first existence.

Beyond earth swings that airless pocked mass of fused rock and gray
 volcanic dust that we know as Luna. Of this our naked eyes assure us.
 But of the smaller satellite, hidden forever from the mundane view by
 Luna's bulk, we know little.


 Small is Sekk, that second moon, less than five hundred miles in
 diameter, but the period of its revolution is thirty two hours, and its
 meaner mass retains a breathable atmosphere. There is life on Sekk,
 life that centers around the sunken star-shaped cavity where an oval
 lake gleams softly in the depths. And the eleven radiating tips of the
 starry abyss are valleys green with jungle growth.


 In one of those green valleys the white savage that the Vasads called
 Noork squatted in the ample crotch of a jungle giant and watched the
 trail forty feet below. For down there moved alertly a golden skinned
 girl, her only weapons a puny polished bow of yellow wood and a
 sheathed dagger.


 Sight of the girl's flowing brown hair and the graceful feminine
 contours of her smooth-limbed body beneath its skin-halter and the
 insignificant breech-clout, made his brow wrinkle with concentration.
 Not forever had he lived in this jungle world of valleys and ragged
 cliffs. Since he had learned the tongue of the hairy Vasads of forest,
 and the tongue of their gold-skinned leader, Gurn, the renegade, he had
 confirmed that belief.


 For a huge gleaming bird had carried him in its talons to the top of
 the cliff above their valley and from the rock fire had risen to devour
 the great bird. Somehow he had been flung clear and escaped the death
 of the mysterious bird-thing. And in his delirium he had babbled the
 words that caused the apish Vasads to name him Noork. Now he repeated
 them aloud.


 ""New York,"" he said, ""good ol' New York.""


 The girl heard. She looked upward fearfully, her rounded bare arm going
 back to the bow slung across her shoulder. Swiftly she fitted an arrow
 and stepped back against the friendly bole of a shaggy barked jungle
 giant. Noork grinned.


 ""Tako, woman,"" he greeted her.


 ""Tako,"" she replied fearfully. ""Who speaks to Tholon Sarna? Be you
 hunter or escaped slave?""


 ""A friend,"" said Noork simply. ""It was I who killed the spotted
narl
last night when it attacked you.""


 Doubtfully the girl put away her bow. Her fingers, however, were never
 far from the hilt of her hunting dagger.


 Noork swung outward from his perch, and then downward along the ladder
 of limbs to her side. The girl exclaimed at his brown skin.


 ""Your hair is the color of the sun!"" she said. ""Your garb is Vasad, yet
 you speak the language of the true men."" Her violet oddly slanting eyes
 opened yet wider. ""Who are you?""


 ""I am Noork,"" the man told her. ""For many days have I dwelt among the
 wild Vasads of the jungle with their golden-skinned chief, Gurn, for
 my friend.""


 The girl impulsively took a step nearer. ""Gurn!"" she cried. ""Is he tall
 and strong? Has he a bracelet of golden discs linked together with
 human hair? Does he talk with his own shadow when he thinks?""


 ""That is Gurn,"" admitted Noork shortly. ""He is also an exile from the
 walled city of Grath. The city rulers call him a traitor. He has told
 me the reason. Perhaps you know it as well?""


 ""Indeed I do,"" cried Sarna. ""My brother said that we should no longer
 make slaves of the captured Zurans from the other valleys.""


 Noork smiled. ""I am glad he is your brother,"" he said simply.
The girl's eyes fell before his admiring gaze and warm blood flooded
 into her rounded neck and lovely cheeks.


 ""Brown-skinned one!"" she cried with a stamp of her shapely little
 sandalled foot. ""I am displeased with the noises of your tongue. I will
 listen to it no more.""


 But her eyes gave the provocative lie to her words. This brown-skinned
 giant with the sunlit hair was very attractive....


 The girl was still talking much later, as they walked together along
 the game-trail. ""When my captors were but one day's march from their
 foul city of Bis the warriors of the city of Konto, through whose
 fertile valley we had journeyed by night, fell upon the slavers.


 ""And in the confusion of the attack five of us escaped. We returned
 toward the valley of Grath, but to avoid the intervening valley where
 our enemies, the men of Konto, lived, we swung close to the Lake of
 Uzdon. And the Misty Ones from the Temple of the Skull trailed us. I
 alone escaped.""


 Noork lifted the short, broad-bladed sword that swung in its sheath
 at his belt and let it drop back into place with a satisfying whisper
 of flexible leather on steel. He looked toward the east where lay the
 mysterious long lake of the Misty Ones.


 ""Some day,"" he said reflectively, ""I am going to visit the island of
 the unseen evil beings who stole away your friends. Perhaps after I
 have taken you to your brother's hidden village, and from there to
 your city of Grath...."" He smiled.


 The girl did not answer. His keen ears, now that he was no longer
 speaking, caught the scuffing of feet into the jungle behind him. He
 turned quickly to find the girl had vanished, and with an instinctive
 reflex of motion he flung himself to one side into the dense wall of
 the jungle. As it was the unseen club thudded down along his right arm,
 numbing it so he felt nothing for some time.


 One armed as he was temporarily, and with an unseen foe to reckon with,
 Noork awkwardly swung up into the comparative safety of the trees. Once
 there, perched in the crotch of a mighty jungle monarch, he peered down
 at the apparently empty stretch of sunken trail beneath.
Noork
At first he saw nothing out of the ordinary. Apparently there was no
 stir of life along that leaf-shadowed way. And then he caught a glimpse
 of blurring shadowy shapes, blotches of cottony mist that blended all
 too well with the foliage. One of the things from the island in the
 Lake of Uzdon moved, and he saw briefly the bottom of a foot dirtied
 with the mud of the trail.


 Noork squinted. So the Misty Ones were not entirely invisible. Pain
 was growing in his numbed arm now, but as it came so came strength. He
 climbed further out on the great branch to where sticky and overripe
 fruit hung heavy. With a grin he locked his legs upon the forking of
 the great limb and filled his arms with fruit.


 A barrage of the juicy fruit blanketed the misty shapes. Stains spread
 and grew. Patchy outlines took on a new color and sharpness. Noork
 found that he was pelting a half-dozen hooded and robed creatures whose
 arms and legs numbered the same as his own, and the last remnant of
 superstitious fear instilled in his bruised brain by the shaggy Vasads
 vanished.


 These Misty Ones were living breathing creatures like himself! They
 were not gods, or demons, or even the ghostly servants of demons. He
 strung his bow quickly, the short powerful bow that Gurn had given him,
 and rained arrows down upon the cowering robed creatures.


 And the monsters fled. They fled down the trail or faded away into the
 jungle. All but one of them. The arrow had pierced a vital portion of
 this Misty One's body. He fell and moved no more.


 A moment later Noork was ripping the stained cloak and hood from the
 fallen creature, curious to learn what ghastly brute-thing hid beneath
 them. His lip curled at what he saw.


 The Misty One was almost like himself. His skin was not so golden as
 that of the other men of Zuran, and his forehead was low and retreating
 in a bestial fashion. Upon his body there was more hair, and his face
 was made hideous with swollen colored scars that formed an irregular
 design. He wore a sleeveless tunic of light green and his only weapons
 were two long knives and a club.


 ""So,"" said Noork, ""the men of the island prey upon their own kind. And
 the Temple of Uzdon in the lake is guarded by cowardly warriors like
 this.""


 Noork shrugged his shoulders and set off at a mile-devouring pace down
 the game trail toward the lake where the Temple of the Skull and its
 unseen guardians lay. Once he stopped at a leaf-choked pool to wash the
 stains from the dead man's foggy robe.


 The jungle was thinning out. Noork's teeth flashed as he lifted the
 drying fabric of the mantle and donned it.
Ud tasted the scent of a man and sluggishly rolled his bullet head from
 shoulder to shoulder as he tried to catch sight of his ages-old enemy.
 For between the hairy quarter-ton beast men of the jungles of Sekk and
 the golden men of the valley cities who enslaved them there was eternal
 war.


 A growl rumbled deep in the hairy half-man's chest. He could see no
 enemy and yet the scent grew stronger with every breath.


 ""You hunt too near the lake,"" called a voice. ""The demons of the water
 will trap you.""


 Ud's great nostrils quivered. He tasted the odor of a friend mingled
 with that of a strange Zuran. He squatted.


 ""It's Noork,"" he grunted. ""Why do I not see you?""


 ""I have stolen the skin of a demon,"" answered the invisible man. ""Go to
 Gurn. Tell him to fear the demons no longer. Tell him the Misty Ones
 can be trapped and skinned.""


 ""Why you want their skins?"" Ud scratched his hairy gray skull.


 ""Go to save Gurn's ..."" and here Noork was stumped for words. ""To save
 his father's woman woman,"" he managed at last. ""Father's woman woman
 called Sarna.""


 And the misty blob of nothingness was gone again, its goal now the
 marshy lowlands that extended upward perhaps a thousand feet from the
 jungle's ragged fringe to end at last in the muddy shallows of the Lake
 of Uzdon.


 To Noork it seemed that all the world must be like these savage jungle
 fastnesses of the twelve valleys and their central lake. He knew that
 the giant bird had carried him from some other place that his battered
 brain could not remember, but to him it seemed incredible that men
 could live elsewhere than in a jungle valley.


 But Noork was wrong. The giant bird that he had ridden into the depths
 of Sekk's fertile valleys had come from a far different world. And the
 other bird, for which Noork had been searching when he came upon the
 golden-skinned girl, was from another world also.


 The other bird had come from space several days before that of Noork,
 the Vasads had told him, and it had landed somewhere within the land
 of sunken valleys. Perhaps, thought Noork, the bird had come from the
 same valley that had once been his home. He would find the bird and
 perhaps then he could remember better who he had been.


 So it was, ironically enough, that Stephen Dietrich—whose memory was
 gone completely—again took up the trail of Doctor Karl Von Mark, last
 of the Axis criminals at large. The trail that had led the red-haired
 young American flier from rebuilding Greece into Africa and the hidden
 valley where Doctor Von Mark worked feverishly to restore the crumbled
 structure of Nazidom, and then had sent him hurtling spaceward in the
 second of the Doctor's crude space-ships was now drawing to an end.
 The Doctor and the young American pilot were both trapped here on this
 little blob of cosmic matter that hides beyond the Moon's cratered bulk.


 The Doctor's ship had landed safely on Sekk, the wily scientist
 preferring the lesser gravity of this fertile world to that of the
 lifeless Moon in the event that he returned again to Earth, but
 Dietrich's spacer had crashed.


 Two words linked Noork with the past, the two words that the Vasads
 had slurred into his name: New York. And the battered wrist watch, its
 crystal and hands gone, were all that remained of his Earthly garb.
Noork paddled the long flat dugout strongly away from the twilight
 shore toward the shadowy loom of the central island. Though he could
 not remember ever having held a paddle before he handled the ungainly
 blade well.


 After a time the clumsy prow of the craft rammed into a yielding
 cushion of mud, and Noork pulled the dugout out of the water into the
 roofing shelter of a clump of drooping trees growing at the water's
 edge.


 Sword in hand he pushed inward from the shore and ended with a
 smothered exclamation against an unseen wall. Trees grew close up to
 the wall and a moment later he had climbed out along a horizontal
 branch beyond the wall's top, and was lowering his body with the aid of
 a braided leather rope to the ground beyond.


 He was in a cultivated field his feet and hands told him. And perhaps
 half a mile away, faintly illumined by torches and red clots of
 bonfires, towered a huge weathered white skull!


 Secure in the knowledge that he wore the invisible robes of a Misty
 One he found a solitary tree growing within the wall and climbed to a
 comfortable crotch. In less than a minute he was asleep.


 ""The new slave,"" a rough voice cut across his slumber abruptly, ""is the
 daughter of Tholon Dist the merchant.""


 Noork was fully awake now. They were speaking of Sarna. Her father's
 name was Tholon Dist. It was early morning in the fields of the Misty
 Ones and he could see the two golden-skinned slaves who talked together
 beneath his tree.


 ""That matters not to the priests of Uzdon,"" the slighter of the
 two slaves, his hair almost white, said. ""If she be chosen for the
 sacrifice to great Uzdon her blood will stain the altar no redder than
 another's.""


 ""But it is always the youngest and most beautiful,"" complained the
 younger slave, ""that the priests chose. I wish to mate with a beautiful
 woman. Tholon Sarna is such a one.""


 The old man chuckled dryly. ""If your wife be plain,"" he said, ""neither
 master nor fellow slave will steal her love. A slave should choose a
 good woman—and ugly, my son.""


 ""Some night,"" snarled the slave, ""I'm going over the wall. Even the
 Misty Ones will not catch me once I have crossed the lake.""


 ""Silence,"" hissed the white-haired man. ""Such talk is madness. We are
 safe here from wild animals. There are no spotted narls on the island
 of Manak. The priests of most holy Uzdon, and their invisible minions,
 are not unkind.


 ""Get at your weeding of the field, Rold,"" he finished, ""and I will
 complete my checking of the gardens.""


 Noork waited until the old man was gone before he descended from the
 tree. He walked along the row until he reached the slave's bent back,
 and he knew by the sudden tightening of the man's shoulder muscles
 that his presence was known. He looked down and saw that his feet made
 clear-cut depressions in the soft rich soil of the field.
""Continue to work,"" he said to the young man. ""Do not be too surprised
 at what I am about to tell you, Rold."" He paused and watched the golden
 man's rather stupid face intently.


 ""I am not a Misty One,"" Noork said. ""I killed the owner of this strange
 garment I wear yesterday on the mainland. I have come to rescue the
 girl, Tholon Sarna, of whom you spoke.""


 Rold's mouth hung open but his hard blunt fingers continued to work.
 ""The Misty Ones, then,"" he said slowly, ""are not immortal demons!"" He
 nodded his long-haired head. ""They are but men. They too can die.""


 ""If you will help me, Rold,"" said Noork, ""to rescue the girl and escape
 from the island I will take you along.""


 Rold was slow in answering. He had been born on the island and yet his
 people were from the valley city of Konto. He knew that they would
 welcome the news that the Misty Ones were not demons. And the girl from
 the enemy city of Grath was beautiful. Perhaps she would love him for
 helping to rescue her and come willingly with him to Konto.


 ""I will help you, stranger,"" he agreed.


 ""Then tell me of the Skull, and of the priests, and of the prison where
 Tholon Sarna is held.""


 The slave's fingers flew. ""All the young female slaves are caged
 together in the pit beneath the Skull. When the sun is directly
 overhead the High Priest will choose one of them for sacrifice to
 mighty Uzdon, most potent of all gods. And with the dawning of the
 next day the chosen one will be bound across the altar before great
 Uzdon's image and her heart torn from her living breast."" The slave's
 mismatched eyes, one blue and the other brown, lifted from his work.


 ""Tholon Sarna is in the pit beneath the Temple with the other female
 slaves. And the Misty Ones stand guard over the entrance to the temple
 pits.""


 ""It is enough,"" said Noork. ""I will go to rescue her now. Be prepared
 to join us as we return. I will have a robe for you if all goes well.""


 ""If you are captured,"" cried Rold nervously, ""you will not tell them I
 talked with you?""


 Noork laughed. ""You never saw me,"" he told the slave.
The skull was a gigantic dome of shaped white stone. Where the
 eye-sockets and gaping nose-hole should have been, black squares of
 rock gave the illusion of vacancy. Slitted apertures that served for
 windows circled the grisly whiteness of the temple's curving walls at
 three distinct levels.


 Noork drifted slowly up the huge series of long bench-like steps
 that led up to the gaping jaws of the Skull. He saw red and
 purple-robed priests with nodding head-dresses of painted plumes and
 feathers climbing and descending the stairs. Among them moved the
 squatty gnarled shapes of burdened Vasads, their shaggy bowed legs
 fettered together with heavy copper or bronze chains, and cringing
 golden-skinned slaves slipped furtively through the press of the
 brilliant-robed ones. The stale sweaty odor of the slaves and the beast
 men mingled with the musky stench of the incense from the temple.


 Other misty blobs, the invisible guards of the ghastly temple, were
 stationed at regular intervals across the great entrance into the
 Skull's interior, but they paid Noork no heed. To them he was another
 of their number.


 He moved swiftly to cross the wide stone-slabbed entry within the
 jaws, and a moment later was looking down into a sunken bowl whose
 rocky floor was a score of feet below where he stood. Now he saw the
 central raised altar where the gleam of precious stones and cunningly
 worked metal—gold, silver and brass—vied with the faded garish
 colors of the draperies beneath it. And on the same dais there loomed
 two beast-headed stone images, the lion-headed god a male and the
 wolf-headed shape a female.


 These then were the two blood hungry deities that the men of Zura
 worshipped—mighty Uzdon and his mate, Lornu!


 Noork joined the descending throng that walked slowly down the central
 ramp toward the altar. As he searched for the entrance to the lower
 pits his eyes took in the stone steps that led upward into the two
 upper levels. Only priests and the vague shapelessness of the Misty
 Ones climbed those steps. The upper levels, then, were forbidden to
 the slaves and common citizens of the island.


 As he circled the curving inner wall a foul dank odor reached his
 sensitive nostrils, and his eyes searched for its origin. He found it
 there just before him, the opening that gave way to a descending flight
 of clammy stone steps. He darted toward the door and from nowhere two
 short swords rose to bar his way.


 ""None are to pass save the priests,"" spoke a voice from nowhere
 gruffly. ""The High Priest knows that we of the temple guards covet the
 most beautiful of the slave women, but we are not to see them until the
 sacrifice is chosen.""


 Noork moved backward a pace. He grumbled something inaudible and drew
 his sword. Before him the two swords slowly drew aside.


 In that instant Noork attacked. His keen sword, whetted to razor
 sharpness on abrasive bits of rock, bit through the hidden neck and
 shoulder of the guard on his right hand, and with the same forward
 impetus of attack he smashed into the body of the startled guard on his
 left.


 His sword had wrenched from his hand as it jammed into the bony
 structure of the decapitated Misty One's shoulder, and now both his
 hands sought the throat of the guard. The unseen man's cry of warning
 gurgled and died in his throat as Noork clamped his fingers shut upon
 it, and his shortened sword stabbed at Noork's back.


 The struggle overbalanced them. They rolled over and over down the
 shadowy stair, the stone smashing at their softer flesh unmercifully.
 For a moment the battling men brought up with a jolt as the obstruction
 of the first guard's corpse arrested their downward course, and then
 they jolted and jarred onward again from blood-slippery step to
 blood-slippery step.


 The sword clattered from the guardian Misty One's clutch and in the
 same instant Noork's steel fingers snapped the neck of the other man
 with a pistol-like report. The limp body beneath him struggled no more.
 He sprang to his feet and became aware of a torch-lighted doorway but a
 half-dozen paces further down along the descending shaft of steps.


 In a moment, he thought, the fellows of this guard would come charging
 out, swords in hand. They could not have failed to hear the struggle
 on the stairs of stone, he reasoned, for here the noise and confusion
 of the upper temple was muted to a murmur.


 So it was that he ran quickly to the door, in his hand the sword that
 had dropped from the dead man's fingers, and sprang inside, prepared to
 battle there the Misty Ones, lest one escape to give the alarm.


 He looked about the narrow stone-walled room with puzzled eyes. Two
 warriors lay on a pallet of straw, one of them emitting hideous
 gurgling sounds that filled the little room with unpleasing echoes.
 Noork grinned.


 From the floor beside the fatter of the two men, the guard who did not
 snore, he took a club. Twice he struck and the gurgling sound changed
 to a steady deep breathing. Noork knew that now the two guards would
 not give the alarm for several hours. Thoughtfully he looked about the
 room. There were several of the hooded cloaks hanging from pegs wedged
 into the crevices of the chamber's wall, their outlines much plainer
 here in the artificial light of the flickering torch.


 Noork shed his own blood-stained robe quickly and donned one of the
 others. The cloaks were rather bulky and so he could carry but two
 others, rolled up, beneath his own protective covering.


 The matter of his disguise thus taken care of he dragged the two bodies
 from the stairway and hid them beneath their own fouled robes in the
 chamber of the sleeping guards. Not until then did he hurry on down the
 stone steps toward the prison pit where Tholon Sarna, the golden girl,
 was held prisoner.
The steps opened into a dimly lit cavern. Pools of foul black water
 dotted the uneven floor and reflected back faintly the light of the two
 sputtering torches beside the entrance. One corner of the cavern was
 walled off, save for a narrow door of interlocking brass strips, and
 toward this Noork made his way.


 He stood beside the door. ""Sarna,"" he called softly, ""Tholon Sarna.""


 There were a score of young women, lately captured from the mainland
 by the Misty Ones, sitting dejectedly upon the foul dampness of the
 rotting grass that was their bed. Most of them were clad in the simple
 skirt and brief jacket, reaching but to the lower ribs, that is the
 mark of the golden people who dwell in the city-states of Zura's
 valleys, but a few wore a simple band of cloth about their hips and
 confined their breasts with a strip of well-cured leopard or antelope
 hide.


 One of the women now came to her feet and as she neared the
 metal-barred entrance Noork saw that she was indeed Sarna. He examined
 the outer lock of the door and found it to be barred with a massive
 timber and the timber locked in place with a metal spike slipped into a
 prepared cavity in the prison's rocky wall.


 ""It is Noork,"" he said softly as she came closer. He saw her eyes go
 wide with fear and sudden hope, and then reached for the spike.


 ""The priest,"" hissed the girl.


 Noork had already heard the sound of approaching feet. He dropped the
 spike and whirled. His sword was in his hand as though by magic, as he
 faced the burly priest of the Skull.


 Across the forehead and upper half of the priest's face a curved shield
 of transparent tinted material was fastened. Noork's eyes narrowed as
 he saw the sword and shield of the gigantic holy man.


 ""So,"" he said, ""to the priests of Uzdon we are not invisible. You do
 not trust your guards, then.""


 The priest laughed. ""We also have robes of invisibility,"" he said, ""and
 the sacred window of Uzdon before our eyes."" He snarled suddenly at the
 silent figure of the white man. ""Down on your knees, guard, and show me
 your face before I kill you!""


 Noork raised his sword. ""Take my hood off if you dare, priest,"" he
 offered.


 The burly priest's answer was a bellow of rage and a lunge forward of
 his sword arm. Their swords clicked together and slid apart with the
 velvety smoothness of bronze on bronze. Noork's blade bit a chunk from
 the priest's conical shield, and in return received a slashing cut that
 drew blood from left shoulder to elbow.


 The fighting grew more furious as the priest pressed the attack. He
 was a skilled swordsman and only the superior agility of the white
 man's legs kept Noork away from that darting priestly blade. Even so
 his robe was slashed in a dozen places and blood reddened his bronzed
 body. Once he slipped in a puddle of foul cavern water and only by the
 slightest of margins did he escape death by the priest's weapon.


 The priest was tiring rapidly, however. The soft living of the temple,
 and the rich wines and over-cooked meats that served to pad his paunch
 so well with fat, now served to rob him of breath. He opened his
 mouth to bawl for assistance from the guard, although it is doubtful
 whether any sound could have penetrated up into the madhouse of the
 main temple's floor, and in that instant Noork flipped his sword at his
 enemy.


 Between the shield and the transparent bit of curving material the
 sword drove, and buried itself deep in the priest's thick neck. Noork
 leaped forward; he snatched the tinted face shield and his sword, and a
 moment later he had torn the great wooden timber from its sockets.


 Tholon Sarna stumbled through the door and he caught her in his arms.
 Hurriedly he loosed one of the two robes fastened about his waist and
 slipped it around her slim shivering shoulders.


 ""Are there other priests hidden here in the pits?"" Noork asked tensely.


 ""No,"" came the girl's low voice, ""I do not think so. I did not know
 that this priest was here until he appeared behind you."" A slow smile
 crossed Noork's hidden features. ""His robe must be close by,"" he told
 the girl. ""He must have been stationed here because the priests feared
 the guards might spirit away some of the prisoners.""


 Slowly he angled back and forth across the floor until his foot touched
 the soft material of the priest's discarded robe near the stairway
 entrance. He slipped the thongs of the transparent mask, called by the
 priest ""Uzdon's window"" over his hood, and then proceeded to don the
 new robe.


 ""My own robe is slit in a dozen places,"" he explained to the girl's
 curious violet eyes—-all that was visible through the narrow vision
 slot of her hood. He finished adjusting the outer robe and took the
 girl's hand.


 ""Come,"" he said, ""let us escape over the wall before the alarm is
 given.""

By VASELEOS GARSON
The starways' Lone Watcher had expected some odd developments
 in his singular, nerve-fraught job on the asteroid. But nothing like the
 weird twenty-one-day liquid test devised by the invading Steel-Blues.
Jon Karyl
 was bolting in a new baffle
 plate on the stationary rocket engine.
 It was a tedious job and took all his
 concentration. So he wasn't paying too much
 attention to what was going on in other
 parts of the little asteroid.


 He didn't see the peculiar blue space
 ship, its rockets throttled down, as it drifted
 to land only a few hundred yards away from
 his plastic igloo.


 Nor did he see the half-dozen steel-blue
 creatures slide out of the peculiar vessel's
 airlock.


 It was only as he crawled out of the
 depths of the rocket power plant that he
 realized something was wrong.


 By then it was almost too late. The six
 blue figures were only fifty feet away, approaching
 him at a lope.


 Jon Karyl took one look and went bounding
 over the asteroid's rocky slopes in fifty-foot
 bounds.


 When you're a Lone Watcher, and
 strangers catch you unawares, you don't
 stand still. You move fast. It's the Watcher's
 first rule. Stay alive. An Earthship may depend
 upon your life.


 As he fled, Jon Karyl cursed softly under
 his breath. The automatic alarm should have
 shrilled out a warning.


 Then he saved as much of his breath as
 he could as some sort of power wave tore
 up the rocky sward to his left. He twisted
 and zig-zagged in his flight, trying to get
 out of sight of the strangers.


 Once hidden from their eyes, he could cut
 back and head for the underground entrance
 to the service station.


 He glanced back finally.


 Two of the steel-blue creatures were jack-rabbiting
 after him, and rapidly closing the
 distance.


 Jon Karyl unsheathed the stubray pistol
 at his side, turned the oxygen dial up for
 greater exertion, increased the gravity pull
 in his space-suit boots as he neared the
 ravine he'd been racing for.


 The oxygen was just taking hold when
 he hit the lip of the ravine and began
 sprinting through its man-high bush-strewn
 course.


 The power ray from behind ripped out
 great gobs of the sheltering bushes. But
 running naturally, bent close to the bottom
 of the ravine, Jon Karyl dodged the bare
 spots. The oxygen made the tremendous
 exertion easy for his lungs as he sped down
 the dim trail, hidden from the two steel-blue
 stalkers.


 He'd eluded them, temporarily at least,
 Jon Karyl decided when he finally edged off
 the dim trail and watched for movement
 along the route behind him.


 He stood up, finally, pushed aside the
 leafy overhang of a bush and looked for
 landmarks along the edge of the ravine.


 He found one, a stubby bush, shaped like
 a Maltese cross, clinging to the lip of the
 ravine. The hidden entrance to the service
 station wasn't far off.


 His pistol held ready, he moved quietly
 on down the ravine until the old water
 course made an abrupt hairpin turn.


 Instead of following around the sharp
 bend, Jon Karyl moved straight ahead
 through the overhanging bushes until he
 came to a dense thicket. Dropping to his
 hands and knees he worked his way under
 the edge of the thicket into a hollowed-out
 space in the center.
There
 , just ahead of him, was the lock
 leading into the service station. Slipping
 a key out of a leg pouch on the space suit,
 he jabbed it into the center of the lock,
 opening the lever housing.


 He pulled strongly on the lever. With a
 hiss of escaping air, the lock swung open.
 Jon Karyl darted inside, the door closing
 softly behind.


 At the end of the long tunnel he stepped
 to the televisor which was fixed on the area
 surrounding the station.


 Jon Karyl saw none of the steel-blue creatures.
 But he saw their ship. It squatted
 like a smashed-down kid's top, its lock shut
 tight.


 He tuned the televisor to its widest range
 and finally spotted one of the Steel-Blues.
 He was looking into the stationary rocket
 engine.


 As Karyl watched, a second Steel-Blue
 came crawling out of the ship.


 The two Steel-Blues moved toward the
 center of the televisor range. They're coming
 toward the station, Karyl thought grimly.


 Karyl examined the two creatures. They
 were of the steel-blue color from the crown
 of their egg-shaped heads to the tips of
 their walking appendages.


 They were about the height of Karyl—six
 feet. But where he tapered from broad
 shoulders to flat hips, they were straight up
 and down. They had no legs, just appendages,
 many-jointed that stretched and
 shrank independent of the other, but keeping
 the cylindrical body with its four pairs
 of tentacles on a level balance.


 Where their eyes would have been was
 an elliptical-shaped lens, covering half the
 egg-head, with its converging ends curving
 around the sides of the head.


 Robots! Jon gauged immediately. But
 where were their masters?


 The Steel-Blues moved out of the range
 of the televisor. A minute later Jon heard
 a pounding from the station upstairs.


 He chuckled. They were like the wolf of
 pre-atomic days who huffed and puffed to
 blow the house down.


 The outer shell of the station was formed
 from stelrylite, the toughest metal in the
 solar system. With the self-sealing lock of
 the same resistant material, a mere pounding
 was nothing.


 Jon thought he'd have a look-see anyway.
 He went up the steel ladder leading to the
 station's power plant and the televisor that
 could look into every room within the
 station.


 He heaved a slight sigh when he reached
 the power room, for right at his hand were
 weapons to blast the ship from the asteroid.


 Jon adjusted one televisor to take in the
 lock to the station. His teeth suddenly
 clamped down on his lower lip.


 Those Steel-Blues were pounding holes
 into the stelrylite with round-headed metal
 clubs. But it was impossible. Stelrylite didn't
 break up that easily.


 Jon leaped to a row of studs, lining up
 the revolving turret which capped the station
 so that its thin fin pointed at the
 squat ship of the invaders.


 Then he went to the atomic cannon's
 firing buttons.


 He pressed first the yellow, then the blue
 button. Finally the red one.


 The thin fin—the cannon's sight—split in
 half as the turret opened and the coiled nose
 of the cannon protruded. There was a
 soundless flash. Then a sharp crack.


 Jon was dumbfounded when he saw the
 bolt ricochet off the ship. This was no ship
 of the solar system. There was nothing that
 could withstand even the slight jolt of power
 given by the station cannon on any of the
 Sun's worlds. But what was this? A piece of
 the ship had changed. A bubble of metal,
 like a huge drop of blue wax, dripped off
 the vessel and struck the rocket of the
 asteroid. It steamed and ran in rivulets.


 He pressed the red button again.


 Then abruptly he was on the floor of the
 power room, his legs strangely cut out from
 under him. He tried to move them. They lay
 flaccid. His arms seemed all right and tried
 to lever himself to an upright position.


 Damn it, he seemed as if he were paralyzed
 from the waist down. But it couldn't
 happen that suddenly.


 He turned his head.


 A Steel-Blue stood facing him. A forked
 tentacle held a square black box.


 Jon could read nothing in that metallic
 face. He said, voice muffled by the confines
 of the plastic helmet, ""Who are you?""


 ""I am""—there was a rising inflection in
 the answer—""a Steel-Blue.""


 There were no lips on the Steel-Blue's
 face to move. ""That is what I have named
 you,"" Jon Karyl said. ""But what are you?""


 ""A robot,"" came the immediate answer.
 Jon was quite sure then that the Steel-Blue
 was telepathic. ""Yes,"" the Steel-Blue answered.
 ""We talk in the language of the
 mind. Come!"" he said peremptorily, motioning
 with the square black box.


 The paralysis left Karyl's legs. He followed
 the Steel-Blue, aware that the lens
 he'd seen on the creature's face had a
 counterpart on the back of the egg-head.


 Eyes in the back of his head, Jon thought.
 That's quite an innovation. ""Thank you,""
 Steel-Blue said.


 There wasn't much fear in Jon Karyl's
 mind. Psychiatrists had proved that when he
 had applied for this high-paying but man-killing
 job as a Lone Watcher on the Solar
 System's starways.


 He had little fear now, only curiosity.
 These Steel-Blues didn't seem inimical.
 They could have snuffed out my life very
 simply. Perhaps they and Solarians can be
 friends.


 Steel-Blue chuckled.
Jon
 followed him through the sundered
 lock of the station. Karyl stopped for a
 moment to examine the wreckage of the
 lock. It had been punched full of holes as
 if it had been some soft cheese instead of a
 metal which Earthmen had spent nearly a
 century perfecting.


 ""We appreciate your compliment,"" Steel-Blue
 said. ""But that metal also is found on
 our world. It's probably the softest and most
 malleable we have. We were surprised you—earthmen,
 is it?—use it as protective
 metal.""


 ""Why are you in this system?"" Jon asked,
 hardly expecting an answer.


 It came anyway. ""For the same reason you
 Earthmen are reaching out farther into your
 system. We need living room. You have
 strategically placed planets for our use. We
 will use them.""


 Jon sighed. For 400 years scientists had
 been preaching preparedness as Earth flung
 her ships into the reaches of the solar system,
 taking the first long step toward the
 conquest of space.


 There are other races somewhere, they
 argued. As strong and smart as man, many
 of them so transcending man in mental and
 inventive power that we must be prepared to
 strike the minute danger shows.


 Now here was the answer to the scientists'
 warning. Invasion by extra-terrestrials.


 ""What did you say?"" asked Steel-Blue.
 ""I couldn't understand.""


 ""Just thinking to myself,"" Jon answered.
 It was a welcome surprise. Apparently his
 thoughts had to be directed outward, rather
 than inward, in order for the Steel-Blues to
 read it.


 He followed the Steel-Blue into the gaping
 lock of the invaders' space ship wondering
 how he could warn Earth. The Space
 Patrol cruiser was due in for refueling at
 his service station in 21 days. But by that
 time he probably would be mouldering in
 the rocky dust of the asteroid.


 It was pitch dark within the ship but the
 Steel-Blue seemed to have no trouble at all
 maneuvering through the maze of corridors.
 Jon followed him, attached to one tentacle.


 Finally Jon and his guide entered a circular
 room, bright with light streaming from
 a glass-like, bulging skylight. They apparently
 were near topside of the vessel.


 A Steel-Blue, more massive than his
 guide and with four more pair of tentacles,
 including two short ones that grew from the
 top of its head, spoke out.


 ""This is the violator?"" Jon's Steel-Blue
 nodded.


 ""You know the penalty? Carry it out.""


 ""He also is an inhabitant of this system,""
 Jon's guide added.


 ""Examine him first, then give him the
 death.""


 Jon Karyl shrugged as he was led from
 the lighted room through more corridors.
 If it got too bad he still had the stubray
 pistol.


 Anyway, he was curious. He'd taken on
 the lonely, nerve-wracking job of service
 station attendant just to see what it offered.


 Here was a part of it, and it was certainly
 something new.


 ""This is the examination room,"" his
 Steel-Blue said, almost contemptuously.


 A green effulgence surrounded him.
There
 was a hiss. Simultaneously, as the
 tiny microphone on the outside of his
 suit picked up the hiss, he felt a chill go
 through his body. Then it seemed as if a
 half dozen hands were inside him, examining
 his internal organs. His stomach contracted.
 He felt a squeeze on his heart. His
 lungs tickled.


 There were several more queer motions
 inside his body.


 Then another Steel-Blue voice said:


 ""He is a soft-metal creature, made up of
 metals that melt at a very low temperature.
 He also contains a liquid whose makeup I
 cannot ascertain by ray-probe. Bring him
 back when the torture is done.""


 Jon Karyl grinned a trifle wryly. What
 kind of torture could this be?


 Would it last 21 days? He glanced at the
 chronometer on his wrist.


 Jon's Steel-Blue led him out of the alien
 ship and halted expectantly just outside the
 ship's lock.


 Jon Karyl waited, too. He thought of the
 stubray pistol holstered at his hip. Shoot my
 way out? It'd be fun while it lasted. But he
 toted up the disadvantages.


 He either would have to find a hiding
 place on the asteroid, and if the Steel-Blues
 wanted him bad enough they could tear the
 whole place to pieces, or somehow get
 aboard the little life ship hidden in the
 service station.


 In that he would be just a sitting duck.


 He shrugged off the slight temptation to
 use the pistol. He was still curious.


 And he was interested in staying alive as
 long as possible. There was a remote chance
 he might warn the SP ship. Unconsciously,
 he glanced toward his belt to see the little
 power pack which, if under ideal conditions,
 could finger out fifty thousand miles into
 space.


 If he could somehow stay alive the 21
 days he might be able to warn the patrol.
 He couldn't do it by attempting to flee, for
 his life would be snuffed out immediately.


 The Steel-Blue said quietly:


 ""It might be ironical to let you warn
 that SP ship you keep thinking about. But
 we know your weapon now. Already our
 ship is equipped with a force field designed
 especially to deflect your atomic guns.""


 Jon Karyl covered up his thoughts
 quickly. They can delve deeper than the
 surface of the mind. Or wasn't I keeping a
 leash on my thoughts?


 The Steel-Blue chuckled. ""You get—absent-minded,
 is it?—every once in a
 while.""


 Just then four other Steel-Blues appeared
 lugging great sheets of plastic and various
 other equipment.


 They dumped their loads and began unbundling
 them.


 Working swiftly, they built a plastic
 igloo, smaller than the living room in the
 larger service station igloo. They ranged instruments
 inside—one of them Jon Karyl
 recognized as an air pump from within the
 station—and they laid out a pallet.


 When they were done Jon saw a miniature
 reproduction of the service station, lacking
 only the cannon cap and fin, and with clear
 plastic walls instead of the opaqueness of the
 other.


 His Steel-Blue said: ""We have reproduced
 the atmosphere of your station so that you
 be watched while you undergo the torture
 under the normal conditions of your life.""


 ""What is this torture?"" Jon Karyl asked.


 The answer was almost caressing: ""It is
 a liquid we use to dissolve metals. It causes
 joints to harden if even so much as a drop
 remains on it long. It eats away the metal,
 leaving a scaly residue which crumbles
 eventually into dust.


 ""We will dilute it with a harmless liquid
 for you since No. 1 does not wish you to die
 instantly.


 ""Enter your""—the Steel-Blue hesitated—""mausoleum.
 You die in your own atmosphere.
 However, we took the liberty of purifying
 it. There were dangerous elements in
 it.""


 Jon walked into the little igloo. The
 Steel-Blues sealed the lock, fingered dials
 and switches on the outside. Jon's space suit
 deflated. Pressure was building up in the
 igloo.


 He took a sample of the air, found that
 it was good, although quite rich in oxygen
 compared with what he'd been using in the
 service station and in his suit.


 With a sigh of relief he took off his helmet
 and gulped huge draughts of the air.


 He sat down on the pallet and waited
 for the torture to begin.


 The Steel Blues crowded about the igloo,
 staring at him through elliptical eyes.


 Apparently, they too, were waiting for the
 torture to begin.


 Jon thought the excess of oxygen was
 making him light-headed.


 He stared at a cylinder which was beginning
 to sprout tentacles from the circle.
 He rubbed his eyes and looked again. An
 opening, like the adjustable eye-piece of a
 spacescope, was appearing in the center of
 the cylinder.


 A square, glass-like tumbler sat in the
 opening disclosed in the four-foot cylinder
 that had sprouted tentacles. It contained a
 yellowish liquid.


 One of the tentacles reached into the
 opening and clasped the glass. The opening
 closed and the cylinder, propelled by locomotor
 appendages, moved toward Jon.


 He didn't like the looks of the liquid in
 the tumbler. It looked like an acid of some
 sort. He raised to his feet.


 He unsheathed the stubray gun and prepared
 to blast the cylinder.
The
 cylinder moved so fast Jon felt his
 eyes jump in his head. He brought the
 stubray gun up—but he was helpless. The
 pistol kept on going up. With a deft movement,
 one of the tentacles had speared it
 from his hand and was holding it out of
 his reach.


 Jon kicked at the glass in the cylinder's
 hand. But he was too slow. Two tentacles
 gripped the kicking leg. Another struck him
 in the chest, knocking him to the pallet. The
 same tentacle, assisted by a new one,
 pinioned his shoulders.


 Four tentacles held him supine. The cylinder
 lifted a glass-like cap from the tumbler
 of liquid.


 Lying there helplessly, Jon was remembering
 an old fairy tale he'd read as a kid.
 Something about a fellow named Socrates
 who was given a cup of hemlock to drink.
 It was the finis for Socrates. But the old
 hero had been nonchalant and calm about
 the whole thing.


 With a sigh, Jon Karyl, who was curious
 unto death, relaxed and said, ""All right,
 bub, you don't have to force-feed me. I'll
 take it like a man.""


 The cylinder apparently understood him,
 for it handed him the tumbler. It even reholstered
 his stubray pistol.


 Jon brought the glass of liquid under his
 nose. The fumes of the liquid were pungent.
 It brought tears to his eyes.


 He looked at the cylinder, then at the
 Steel-Blues crowding around the plastic
 igloo. He waved the glass at the audience.


 ""To Earth, ever triumphant,"" he toasted.
 Then he drained the glass at a gulp.


 Its taste was bitter, and he felt hot
 prickles jab at his scalp. It was like eating
 very hot peppers. His eyes filled with tears.
 He coughed as the stuff went down.


 But he was still alive, he thought in
 amazement. He'd drunk the hemlock and
 was still alive.


 The reaction set in quickly. He hadn't
 known until then how tense he'd been. Now
 with the torture ordeal over, he relaxed. He
 laid down on the pallet and went to sleep.


 There was one lone Steel-Blue watching
 him when he rubbed the sleep out of his
 eyes and sat up.


 He vanished almost instantly. He, or another
 like him, returned immediately accompanied
 by a half-dozen others, including
 the multi-tentacled creature known as No. 1.


 One said,


 ""You are alive."" The thought registered
 amazement. ""When you lost consciousness,
 we thought you had""—there was a hesitation—""as
 you say, died.""


 ""No,"" Jon Karyl said. ""I didn't die. I
 was just plain dead-beat so I went to sleep.""
 The Steel-Blues apparently didn't understand.


 ""Good it is that you live. The torture
 will continue,"" spoke No. 1 before loping
 away.


 The cylinder business began again. This
 time, Jon drank the bitter liquid slowly, trying
 to figure out what it was. It had a
 familiar, tantalizing taste but he couldn't
 quite put a taste-finger on it.


 His belly said he was hungry. He glanced
 at his chronometer. Only 20 days left before
 the SP ship arrived.


 Would this torture—he chuckled—last
 until then? But he was growing more and
 more conscious that his belly was screaming
 for hunger. The liquid had taken the edge
 off his thirst.


 It was on the fifth day of his torture that
 Jon Karyl decided that he was going to get
 something to eat or perish in the attempt.


 The cylinder sat passively in its niche in
 the circle. A dozen Steel-Blues were watching
 as Jon put on his helmet and unsheathed
 his stubray.


 They merely watched as he pressed the
 stubray's firing stud. Invisible rays licked
 out of the bulbous muzzle of the pistol.
 The plastic splintered.


 Jon was out of his goldfish bowl and
 striding toward his own igloo adjacent to
 the service station when a Steel-Blue
 accosted him.


 ""Out of my way,"" grunted Jon, waving
 the stubray. ""I'm hungry.""


 ""I'm the first Steel-Blue you met,"" said
 the creature who barred his way. ""Go back
 to your torture.""


 ""But I'm so hungry I'll chew off one of
 your tentacles and eat it without seasoning.""


 ""Eat?"" The Steel-Blue sounded puzzled.


 ""I want to refuel. I've got to have food
 to keep my engine going.""


 Steel-Blue chuckled. ""So the hemlock, as
 you call it, is beginning to affect you at
 last? Back to the torture room.""


 ""Like R-dust,"" Jon growled. He pressed
 the firing stud on the stubray gun. One of
 Steel-Blue's tentacles broke off and fell to
 the rocky sward.


 Steel-Blue jerked out the box he'd used
 once before. A tentacle danced over it.


 Abruptly Jon found himself standing on
 a pinnacle of rock. Steel-Blue had cut a
 swath around him 15 feet deep and five feet
 wide.


 ""Back to the room,"" Steel-Blue commanded.


 Jon resheathed the stubray pistol,
 shrugged non-committally and leaped the
 trench. He walked slowly back and reentered
 the torture chamber.


 The Steel-Blues rapidly repaired the damage
 he'd done.


 As he watched them, Jon was still curious,
 but he was getting mad underneath at
 the cold egoism of the Steel-Blues.


 By the shimmering clouds of Earth, by
 her green fields, and dark forests, he'd
 stay alive to warn the SP ship.


 Yes, he'd stay alive till then. And send
 the story of the Steel-Blues' corrosive acid
 to it. Then hundreds of Earth's ships could
 equip themselves with spray guns and squirt
 citric acid and watch the Steel-Blues fade
 away.


 It sounded almost silly to Jon Karyl. The
 fruit acid of Earth to repel these invaders—it
 doesn't sound possible. That couldn't be
 the answer.


 Citric acid wasn't the answer, Jon Karyl
 discovered a week later.


 The Steel-Blue who had captured him in
 the power room of the service station came
 in to examine him.


 ""You're still holding out, I see,"" he observed
 after poking Jon in every sensitive
 part of his body.


 ""I'll suggest to No. 1 that we increase
 the power of the—ah—hemlock. How do
 you feel?""


 Between the rich oxygen and the dizziness
 of hunger, Jon was a bit delirious. But he
 answered honestly enough: ""My guts feel as
 if they're chewing each other up. My bones
 ache. My joints creak. I can't coordinate I'm
 so hungry.""


 ""That is the hemlock,"" Steel-Blue said.


 It was when he quaffed the new and
 stronger draught that Jon knew that his
 hope that it was citric acid was squelched.


 The acid taste was weaker which meant
 that the citric acid was the diluting liquid.
 It was the liquid he couldn't taste beneath
 the tang of the citric acid that was the corrosive
 acid.


 On the fourteenth day, Jon was so weak
 he didn't feel much like moving around. He
 let the cylinder feed him the hemlock.


 No. 1 came again to see him, and went
 away chuckling, ""Decrease the dilution.
 This Earthman at last is beginning to
 suffer.""
Staying
 alive had now become a fetish
 with Jon.


 On the sixteenth day, the Earthman realized
 that the Steel-Blues also were waiting
 for the SP ship.


 The extra-terrestrials had repaired the
 blue ship where the service station atomic
 ray had struck. And they were doing a little
 target practice with plastic bubbles only a
 few miles above the asteroid.


 When his chronometer clocked off the
 beginning of the twenty-first day, Jon received
 a tumbler of the hemlock from the
 hands of No. 1 himself.


 ""It is the hemlock,"" he chuckled, ""undiluted.
 Drink it and your torture is over.
 You will die before your SP ship is destroyed.


 ""We have played with you long enough.
 Today we begin to toy with your SP ship.
 Drink up, Earthman, drink to enslavement.""


 Weak though he was Jon lunged to his
 feet, spilling the tumbler of liquid. It ran
 cool along the plastic arm of his space suit.
 He changed his mind about throwing the
 contents on No. 1.


 With a smile he set the glass at his lips
 and drank. Then he laughed at No. 1.


 ""The SP ship will turn your ship into
 jelly.""


 No. 1 swept out, chuckling. ""Boast if you
 will, Earthman, it's your last chance.""


 There was an exultation in Jon's heart
 that deadened the hunger and washed away
 the nausea.


 At last he knew what the hemlock was.


 He sat on the pallet adjusting the little
 power-pack radio. The SP ship should now
 be within range of the set. The space patrol
 was notorious for its accuracy in keeping to
 schedule. Seconds counted like years. They
 had to be on the nose, or it meant disaster
 or death.


 He sent out the call letters.


 ""AX to SP-101 ... AX to SP-101 ... AX
 to SP-101 ...""


 Three times he sent the call, then began
 sending his message, hoping that his signal
 was reaching the ship. He couldn't know if
 they answered. Though the power pack
 could get out a message over a vast distance,
 it could not pick up messages even
 when backed by an SP ship's power unless
 the ship was only a few hundred miles
 away.


 The power pack was strictly a distress
 signal.


 He didn't know how long he'd been
 sending, nor how many times his weary
 voice had repeated the short but desperate
 message.


 He kept watching the heavens and hoping.


 Abruptly he knew the SP ship was coming,
 for the blue ship of the Steel-Blues was
 rising silently from the asteroid.


 Up and up it rose, then flames flickered
 in a circle about its curious shape. The ship
 disappeared, suddenly accelerating.


 Jon Karyl strained his eyes.


 Finally he looked away from the heavens
 to the two Steel-Blues who stood negligently
 outside the goldfish bowl.


 Once more, Jon used the stubray pistol.
 He marched out of the plastic igloo and ran
 toward the service station.


 He didn't know how weak he was until
 he stumbled and fell only a few feet from
 his prison.


 The Steel-Blues just watched him.


 He crawled on, around the circular pit in
 the sward of the asteroid where one Steel-Blue
 had shown him the power of his
 weapon.


 He'd been crawling through a nightmare
 for years when the quiet voice penetrated
 his dulled mind.


 ""Take it easy, Karyl. You're among
 friends.""


 He pried open his eyes with his will. He
 saw the blue and gold of a space guard's
 uniform. He sighed and drifted into unconsciousness.
He was
 still weak days later when
 Capt. Ron Small of SP-101 said,


 ""Yes, Karyl, it's ironical. They fed you
 what they thought was sure death, and it's
 the only thing that kept you going long
 enough to warn us.""


 ""I was dumb for a long time,"" Karyl said.
 ""I thought that it was the acid, almost to
 the very last. But when I drank that last
 glass, I knew they didn't have a chance.


 ""They were metal monsters. No wonder
 they feared that liquid. It would rust their
 joints, short their wiring, and kill them.
 No wonder they stared when I kept alive
 after drinking enough to completely annihilate
 a half-dozen of them.


 ""But what happened when you met the
 ship?""


 The space captain grinned.


 ""Not much. Our crew was busy creating
 a hollow shell filled with
water
to be shot
 out of a rocket tube converted into a projectile
 thrower.


 ""These Steel-Blues, as you call them, put
 traction beams on us and started tugging us
 toward the asteroid. We tried a couple of
 atomic shots but when they just glanced off,
 we gave up.


 ""They weren't expecting the shell of
 water. When it hit that blue ship, you could
 almost see it oxidize before your eyes.


 ""I guess they knew what was wrong right
 away. They let go the traction beams and
 tried to get away. They forgot about the
 force field, so we just poured atomic fire
 into the weakening ship. It just melted
 away.""


 Jon Karyl got up from the divan where
 he'd been lying. ""They thought I was a
 metal creature, too. But where do you suppose
 they came from?""


 The captain shrugged. ""Who knows?""


 Jon set two glasses on the table.


 ""Have a drink of the best damn water in
 the solar system?"" He asked Capt. Small.


 ""Don't mind if I do.""


 The water twinkled in the two glasses,
 winking as if it knew just what it had
 done.

In the credo of this inspiringly selfless
 
cyberneticist, nothing was too good for his colleagues
 
in science.
Much
too good for them
!
October 5, 1959
Well, here I am at Princeton. IFACS is quite a place,
quite
a place,
 but the atmosphere's darned informal. My colleagues seem to be mostly
 youngish fellows dressed in sloppy dungarees, sweatshirts (the kind
 Einstein made so famous) and moccasins, and when they're not puttering
 in the labs they're likely to be lolling on the grass, lounging in
 front of the fire in commons, or slouching around in conference rooms
 chalking up equations on a blackboard. No way of telling, of course,
 but a lot of these collegiate-looking chaps must be in the MS end,
 whatever that is. You'd think fellows in something secret like that
 would dress and behave with a little more dignity.


 Guess I was a little previous in packing my soup-and-fish. Soon as I
 was shown to my room in the bachelor dorms, I dug it out and hung it
 way back in the closet, out of sight. When in Rome, etc. Later that day
 I discovered they carry dungarees in the Co-op; luckily, they had the
 pre-faded kind.
October 6, 1959
Met the boss this morning—hardly out of his thirties, crew-cut,
 wearing a flannel hunting shirt and dirty saddleshoes. I was glad I'd
 thought to change into my dungarees before the interview.


 ""Parks,"" he said, ""you can count yourself a very fortunate young man.
 You've come to the most important address in America, not excluding the
 Pentagon. In the world, probably. To get you oriented, suppose I sketch
 in some of the background of the place.""


 That would be most helpful, I said. I wondered, though, if he was as
 naive as he sounded. Did he think I'd been working in cybernetics labs
 for going on six years without hearing enough rumors about IFACS to
 make me dizzy? Especially about the MS end of IFACS?


 ""Maybe you know,"" he went on, ""that in the days of Oppenheimer and
 Einstein, this place was called the Institute for Advanced Studies.
 It was run pretty loosely then—in addition to the mathematicians and
 physicists, they had all sorts of queer ducks hanging around—poets,
 egyptologists, numismatists, medievalists, herbalists, God alone knows
 what all. By 1955, however, so many cybernetics labs had sprung up
 around the country that we needed some central coordinating agency,
 so Washington arranged for us to take over here. Naturally, as soon
 as we arrived, we eased out the poets and egyptologists, brought in
 our own people, and changed the name to the Institute for Advanced
Cybernetics
Studies. We've got some pretty keen projects going now,
pret
-ty keen.""


 I said I'd bet, and did he have any idea which project I would fit into?


 ""Sure thing,"" he said. ""You're going to take charge of a very important
 lab. The Pro lab."" I guess he saw my puzzled look. ""Pro—that's short
 for prosthetics, artificial limbs. You know, it's really a scandal.
 With our present level of technology, we should have artificial limbs
 which in many ways are even better than the originals, but actually
 we're still making do with modifications of the same primitive, clumsy
 pegs and hooks they were using a thousand years ago. I'm counting on
 you to get things hopping in that department. It's a real challenge.""


 I said it sure was a challenge, and of course I'd do my level best to
 meet it. Still, I couldn't help feeling a bit disappointed. Around
 cybernetics circles, I hinted, you heard a lot of talk about the
 hush-hush MS work that was going on at IFACS and it sounded so exciting
 that, well, a fellow sort of hoped he might get into
that
end of
 things.


 ""Look here, Parks,"" the boss said. He seemed a little peeved.
 ""Cybernetics is teamwork, and the first rule of any team is that not
 everybody can be quarterback. Each man has a specific job on our team,
 one thing he's best suited for, and what
you're
best suited for,
 obviously, is the Pro lab. We've followed your work closely these last
 few years, and we were quite impressed by the way you handled those
 photo-electric-cell insects. You pulled off a brilliant engineering
 stunt, you know, when you induced nervous breakdown in your robot
 moths and bedbugs, and proved that the oscillations they developed
 corresponded to those which the human animal develops in intention
 tremor and Parkinson's disease. A keen bit of cybernetic thinking,
 that.
Very
keen.""


 It was just luck, I told him modestly.


 ""Nonsense,"" the boss insisted. ""You're first and foremost a talented
 neuro man, and that's exactly what we need in the Pro department.
 There, you see, the problem is primarily one of duplicating a nervous
 mechanism in the metal, of bridging the gap between the neuronic and
 electronic. So buckle down, and if you hear any more gossip about MS,
 forget it fast—it's not a proper subject of conversation for you. The
 loyalty oath you signed is very specific about the trouble you can get
 into with loose talk. Remember that.""


 I said I certainly would, and thanks a whole lot for the advice.


 Damn! Everybody knows MS is the thing to get into. It gives you real
 standing in the field if it gets around that you're an MS man. I had my
 heart set on getting into MS.
October 6, 1959
It never rains, etc.: now it turns out that Len Ellsom's here, and
he's
in MS! Found out about it in a funny way. Two mornings a week,
 it seems, the staff members get into their skiing and hunting clothes
 and tramp into the woods to cut logs for their fireplaces. Well, this
 morning I went with them, and as we were walking along the trail
 Goldweiser, my assistant, told me the idea behind these expeditions.


 ""You can't get away from it,"" he said. ""E=MC
 2
 is in a tree trunk
 as well as in a uranium atom or a solar system. When you're hacking
 away at a particular tree, though, you don't think much about such
 intangibles—like any good, untheoretical lumberjack, you're a lot
 more concerned with superficialities, such as which way the grain
 runs, how to avoid the knots, and so on. It's very restful. So long
 as a cyberneticist is sawing and chopping, he's not a sliver of
 uncontaminated cerebrum contemplating the eternal slippery verities of
 gravity and electromagnetism; he's just one more guy trying to slice
 up one more log. Makes him feel he belongs to the human race again.
 Einstein, you know, used to get the same results with a violin.""


 Now, I've heard talk like that before, and I don't like it. I don't
 like it at all. It so happens that I feel very strongly on the subject.
 I think a scientist should like what he's doing and not want to take
 refuge in Nature from the Laws of Nature (which is downright illogical,
 anyhow). I, for one, enjoy cutting logs precisely
because
, when my
 saw rasps across a knot, I know that the innermost secret of that
 knot, as of all matter in the Universe, is E=MC
 2
 . It's my job to
know
it, and it's very satisfying to
know
that I know it and that
 the general run of people don't. I was about to put this thought into
 words, but before I could open my mouth, somebody behind us spoke up.


 ""Bravo, Goldie,"" he said. ""Let us by all means pretend that we belong
 to the human race. Make way for the new cyberneticists with their old
 saws. Cyberneticist, spare that tree!""


 I turned around to see who could be making jokes in such bad taste
 and—as I might have guessed—it was Len Ellsom. He was just as
 surprised as I was.


 ""Well,"" he said, ""if it isn't Ollie Parks! I thought you were out in
 Cal Tech, building schizophrenic bedbugs.""


 After M. I. T. I
had
spent some time out in California doing
 neuro-cyber research, I explained—but what was
he
doing here? I'd
 lost track of him after he'd left Boston; the last I'd heard, he'd been
 working on the giant robot brain Remington-Rand was developing for the
 Air Force. I remembered seeing his picture in the paper two or three
 times while he was working on the brain.


 ""I was with Remington a couple of years,"" he told me. ""If I do say
 so myself, we built the Air Force a real humdinger of a brain—in
 addition to solving the most complex problems in ballistics, it could
 whistle
Dixie
and, in moments of stress, produce a sound not unlike
 a Bronx cheer. Naturally, for my prowess in the electronic simulation
 of I.Q., I was tapped for the brain department of these hallowed
 precincts.""


 ""Oh?"" I said. ""Does that mean you're in MS?"" It wasn't an easy idea to
 accept, but I think I was pretty successful in keeping my tone casual.


 ""Ollie, my boy,"" he said in an exaggerated stage whisper, putting his
 finger to his lips, ""in the beginning was the word and the word was
 mum. Leave us avoid the subject of brains in this
keen
place. We
 all have a job to do on the team."" I suppose that was meant to be a
 humorous imitation of the boss; Len always did fancy himself quite a
 clown.


 We were separated during the sawing, but he caught up with me on the
 way back and said, ""Let's get together soon and have a talk, Ollie.
 It's been a long time.""


 He wants to talk about Marilyn, I suppose. Naturally. He has a guilty
 conscience. I'll have to make it quite clear to him that the whole
 episode is a matter of complete indifference to me. Marilyn is a closed
 book in my life; he must understand that. But can you beat that? He's
 right in the middle of MS! That lad certainly gets around. It's the
 usual Ellsom charm, I suppose.


 The usual Ellsom technique for irritating people, too. He's still
 trying to get my goat; he knows how much I've always hated to be called
 Ollie. Must watch Goldweiser. Thought he laughed pretty heartily at
 Len's wisecracks.
October 18, 1959
Things are shaping up in the Pro lab. Here's how I get the picture.


 A year ago, the boss laid down a policy for the lab: begin with legs
 because, while the neuro-motor systems in legs and arms are a lot
 alike, those in legs are much simpler. If we build satisfactory legs,
 the boss figures, we can then tackle arms; the main difficulties will
 have been licked.


 Well, last summer, in line with this approach, the Army picked out
 a double amputee from the outpatient department of Walter Reed
 Hospital—fellow by the name of Kujack, who lost both his legs in a
 land mine explosion outside Pyongyang—and shipped him up here to be a
 subject in our experiments.


 When Kujack arrived, the neuro boys made a major decision. It didn't
 make sense, they agreed, to keep building experimental legs directly
 into the muscles and nerves of Kujack's stumps; the surgical procedure
 in these cine-plastic jobs is complicated as all getout, involves a
 lot of pain for the subject and, what's more to the point, means long
 delays each time while the tissues heal.


 Instead, they hit on the idea of integrating permanent metal and
 plastic sockets into the stumps, so constructed that each new
 experimental limb can be snapped into place whenever it's ready for a
 trial.
By the time I took over, two weeks ago, Goldweiser had the sockets
 worked out and fitted to Kujack's stumps, and the muscular and
 neural tissues had knitted satisfactorily. There was only one hitch:
 twenty-three limbs had been designed, and all twenty-three had been
 dismal flops. That's when the boss called me in.


 There's no mystery about the failures. Not to me, anyhow. Cybernetics
 is simply the science of building machines that will duplicate and
 improve on the organs and functions of the animal, based on what we
 know about the systems of communication and control in the animal. All
 right. But in any particular cybernetics project, everything depends
 on just how
many
of the functions you want to duplicate, just how
much
of the total organ you want to replace.


 That's why the robot-brain boys can get such quick and spectacular
 results, have their pictures in the papers all the time, and become
 the real glamor boys of the profession. They're not asked to duplicate
 the human brain in its
entirety
—all they have to do is isolate and
 imitate one particular function of the brain, whether it's a simple
 operation in mathematics or a certain type of elementary logic.


 The robot brain called the Eniac, for example, is exactly what its
 name implies—an Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, and
 it just has to be able to integrate and compute figures faster and
 more accurately than the human brain can. It doesn't have to have
 daydreams and nightmares, make wisecracks, suffer from anxiety, and
 all that. What's more, it doesn't even have to
look
like a brain or
 fit into the tiny space occupied by a real brain. It can be housed
 in a six-story building and look like an overgrown typewriter or an
 automobile dashboard or even a pogo stick. All it has to do is tell you
 that two times two equals four, and tell you fast.


 When you're told to build an artificial leg that'll take the place
 of a real one, the headaches begin. Your machine must not only
look
like its living model, it must
also
balance and support, walk, run,
 hop, skip, jump, etc., etc.
Also
, it must fit into the same space.
Also
, it must feel everything a real leg feels—touch, heat, cold,
 pain, moisture, kinesthetic sensations—
as well as
execute all the
 brain-directed movements that a real leg can.


 So you're not duplicating this or that function; you're reconstructing
 the organ in its totality, or trying to. Your pro must have a full set
 of sensory-motor communication systems, plus machines to carry out
 orders, which is impossible enough to begin with.


 But our job calls for even more. The pro mustn't only
equal
the
 real thing, it must be
superior
! That means creating a synthetic
 neuro-muscular system that actually
improves
on the nerves and
 muscles Nature created in the original!


 When our twenty-fourth experimental model turned out to be a dud last
 week—it just hung from Kujack's stump, quivering like one of my robot
 bedbugs, as though it had a bad case of intention tremor—Goldweiser
 said something that made an impression on me.
""They don't want much from us,"" he said sarcastically. ""They just want
 us to be God.""


 I didn't care for his cynical attitude at all, but he had a point. Len
 Ellsom just has to build a fancy adding machine to get his picture in
 the papers.
I
have to be God!
October 22, 1959
Don't know what to make of Kujack. His attitude is peculiar. Of course,
 he's very co-operative, lies back on the fitting table and doesn't
 even wince when we snap on the pros, and he does his best to carry out
 instructions. Still, there's something funny about the way he looks at
 me. There's a kind of malicious expression in his eyes. At times, come
 to think of it, he reminds me of Len.


 Take this afternoon, for instance. I've just worked out an entirely
 different kind of leg based on a whole new arrangement of solenoids to
 duplicate the muscle systems, and I decided to give it a try. When I
 was slipping the model into place, I looked up and caught Kujack's eye
 for a moment. He seemed to be laughing at something, although his face
 was expressionless.


 ""All right,"" I said. ""Let's make a test. I understand you used to be
 quite a football player. Well, just think of how you used to kick a
 football and try to do it now.""


 He really seemed to be trying; the effort made him sweat. All that
 happened, though, was that the big toe wriggled a little and the knee
 buckled. Dud Number Twenty-five. I was sore, of course, especially when
 I noticed that Kujack was more amused than ever.


 ""You seem to think something's pretty funny,"" I said.


 ""Don't get me wrong, Doc,"" he said, much too innocently. ""It's just
 that I've been thinking. Maybe you'd have more luck if you thought of
 me as a bedbug.""


 ""Where did you get that idea?""


 ""From Doc Ellsom. I was having some beers with him the other night.
 He's got a very high opinion of you, says you build the best bedbugs in
 the business.""


 I find it hard to believe that Len Ellsom would say anything really
 nice about me. Must be his guilt about Marilyn that makes him talk that
 way. I don't like his hanging around Kujack.
October 25, 1959
The boss came along on our woodcutting expedition this morning and
 volunteered to work the other end of my two-handled saw. He asked how
 things were coming in the Pro lab.


 ""As I see it,"" I said, ""there are two sides to the problem, the
 kinesthetic and the neural. We're making definite progress on the K
 side—I've worked out a new solenoid system, with some miniature motors
 tied in, and I think it'll give us a leg that
moves
damned well. I
 don't know about the N side, though. It's pretty tough figuring out
 how to hook the thing up electrically with the central nervous system
 so that the brain can control it. Some sort of compromise system of
 operation, along mechanical rather than neural lines, would be a lot
 simpler.""


 ""You mean,"" the boss said with a smile, ""that it's stumping you.""


 I was relieved to see him taking it so well because I know how anxious
 he is to get results from the Pro lab. Since Pro is one of the few
 things going on at IFACS that can be talked about, he's impatient for
 us to come up with something he can release to the press. As the public
 relations officer explained it to me at dinner the other night, people
 get worried when they know there's something like IFACS going, but
 don't get any real information about it, so the boss, naturally, wants
 to relieve the public's curiosity with a good, reassuring story about
 our work.


 I knew I was taking an awful chance spilling the whole K-N thing to him
 the way I did, but I had to lay the groundwork for a little plan I've
 just begun to work on.


 ""By the way, sir,"" I said, ""I ran into Len Ellsom the other day. I
 didn't know he was here.""


 ""Do you know him?"" the boss said. ""Good man. One of the best
 brains-and-games men you'll find anywhere.""


 I explained that Len had gotten his degree at M.I.T. the year before I
 did. From what I'd heard, I added, he'd done some important work on the
 Remington-Rand ballistics computer.


 ""He did indeed,"" the boss said, ""but that's not the half of it. After
 that he made some major contributions to the robot chess player. As a
 matter of fact, that's why he's here.""


 I said I hadn't heard about the chess player.


 ""As soon as it began to play a really good game of chess, Washington
 put the whole thing under wraps for security reasons. Which is why you
 won't hear any more about it from me.""


 I'm no Eniac, but I can occasionally put two and two together myself.
 If the boss's remarks mean anything, they mean that an electronic brain
 capable of playing games has been developed, and that it's led to
 something important militarily. Of course! I could kick myself for not
 having guessed it before.


 Brains-and-games—that's what MS is all about, obviously. It had to
 happen: out of the mathematical analysis of chess came a robot chess
 player, and out of the chess player came some kind of mechanical brain
 that's useful in military strategy.
That's
what Len Ellsom's in the
 middle of.


 ""Really brilliant mind,"" the boss said after we'd sawed for a while.
 ""Keen. But he's a little erratic—quirky, queer sense of humor. Isn't
 that your impression?""


 ""Definitely,"" I said. ""I'd be the last one in the world to say a word
 against Len, but he was always a little peculiar. Very gay one moment
 and very sour the next, and inclined to poke fun at things other people
 take seriously. He used to write poetry.""


 ""I'm very glad to know that,"" the boss said. ""Confirms my own feeling
 about him.""


 So the boss has some doubts about Len.
October 27, 1959
Unpleasant evening with Len. It all started after dinner when he showed
 up in my room, wagged his finger at me and said, ""Ollie, you've been
 avoiding me. That hurts. Thought we were pals, thick and thin and till
 debt and death do us part.""


 I saw immediately that he was drunk—he always gets his words mixed
 up when he's drunk—and I tried to placate him by explaining that it
 wasn't anything like that; I'd been busy.


 ""If we're pals,"" he said, ""come on and have a beer with me.""


 There was no shaking him off, so I followed him down to his car and we
 drove to this sleazy little bar in the Negro part of town. As soon as
 we sat down in a booth, Len borrowed all the nickels I had, put them
 in the jukebox and pressed the levers for a lot of old Louie Armstrong
 records.


 ""Sorry, kid,"" he said. ""I know how you hate this real jazzy stuff, but
 can't have a reunion without music, and there isn't a polka or cowboy
 ballad or hillbilly stomp in the box. They lack the folksy touch on
 this side of the tracks."" Len has always been very snobbish about my
 interest in folk music.


 I asked him what he'd been doing during the day.


 ""Lushing it up,"" he said. ""Getting stinking from drinking."" He still
 likes to use the most flamboyant slang; I consider it an infantile form
 of protest against what he regards as the ""genteel"" manner of academic
 people. ""I got sort of restless this morning, so I ducked out and beat
 it into New York and looked up my friend Steve Lundy in the Village.
 Spent the afternoon liquidating our joint assets. Liquidating our
 assets in the joints.""


 What, I wanted to know, was he feeling restless about?


 ""Restless for going on three years now."" His face grew solemn, as
 though he were thinking it over very carefully. ""I'll amend that
 statement. Hell with the Aesopian language. I've been a plain lush for
 going on three years. Ever since—""


 If it was something personal—I suggested.


 ""It is
not
something personal,"" he said, mimicking me. ""Guess I can
 tell an old cyberneticist pal about it. Been a lush for three years
 because I've been scared for three years. Been scared for three years
 because three years ago I saw a machine beat a man at a game of chess.""


 A machine that plays chess? That was interesting, I said.


 ""Didn't tell you the whole truth the other day,"" Len mumbled. ""I
did
work on the Remington-Rand computer, sure, but I didn't come to IFACS
 directly from that. In between I spent a couple years at the Bell
 Telephone Labs. Claude Shannon—or, rather, to begin with there was
 Norbert Wiener back at M.I.T.—it's complicated....""


 ""Look,"" I said, ""are you sure you want to talk about it?""


 ""Stop wearing your loyalty oath on your sleeve,"" he said belligerently.
 ""Sure I want to talk about it. Greatest subject I know. Begin at
 the beginning. Whole thing started back in the Thirties with those
 two refugee mathematicians who used to be here at the Institute for
 Advanced Studies when Einstein was around. Von Morgan and Neumanstern,
 no, Von
Neu
mann and
Mor
ganstern. You remember, they did a
 mathematical analysis of all the possible kinds of games, poker,
 tossing pennies, chess, bridge, everything, and they wrote up their
 findings in a volume you certainly know,
The Theory of Games
.


 ""Well, that got Wiener started. You may remember that when he founded
 the science of cybernetics, he announced that on the basis of the
 theory of games, it was feasible to design a robot computing machine
 that would play a better than average game of chess. Right after that,
 back in '49 or maybe it was '50, Claude Shannon of the Bell Labs said
 Wiener wasn't just talking, and to prove it he was going to
build
the robot chess player. Which he proceeded withforth—forthwith—to
 do. Sometime in '53, I was taken off the Remington-Rand project and
 assigned to Bell to work with him.""


 ""Maybe we ought to start back,"" I cut in. ""I've got a lot of work to
 do.""


 ""The night is young,"" he said, ""and you're so dutiful. Where was I? Oh
 yes, Bell. At first our electronic pawn-pusher wasn't so hot—it could
 beat the pants off a lousy player, but an expert just made it look
 silly. But we kept improving it, see, building more and more electronic
 anticipation and gambit-plotting powers into it, and finally, one great
 day in '55, we thought we had all the kinks ironed out and were ready
 for the big test. By this time, of course, Washington had stepped in
 and taken over the whole project.


 ""Well, we got hold of Fortunescu, the world's champion chess player,
 sat him down and turned the robot loose on him. For four hours straight
 we followed the match, with a delegation of big brass from Washington,
 and for four hours straight the machine trounced Fortunescu every game.
 That was when I began to get scared. I went out that night and got
 really loaded.""


 What had he been so scared about? It seemed to me he should have felt
 happy.


 ""Listen, Ollie,"" he said, ""for Christ's sake, stop talking like a Boy
 Scout for once in your life.""


 If he was going to insult me—


 ""No insult intended. Just listen. I'm a terrible chess player. Any
 five-year-old could chatemeck—checkmate—me with his brains tied
 behind his back. But this machine which I built, helped build, is the
 champion chess player of the world. In other words, my brain has given
 birth to a brain which can do things my brain could never do. Don't you
 find that terrifying?""


 ""Not at all,"" I said. ""
You
made the machine, didn't you? Therefore,
 no matter what it does, it's only an extension of you. You should feel
 proud to have devised a powerful new tool.""


 ""Some tool,"" he sneered. He was so drunk by now that I could hardly
 understand what he was saying. ""The General Staff boys in Washington
 were all hopped up about that little old tool, and for a plenty good
 reason—they understood that mechanized warfare is only the most
 complicated game the human race has invented so far, an elaborate form
 of chess which uses the population of the world for pawns and the
 globe for a chessboard. They saw, too, that when the game of war gets
 this complex, the job of controlling and guiding it becomes too damned
 involved for any number of human brains, no matter how nimble.


 ""In other words, my beamish Boy Scout, modern war needs just this kind
 of strategy tool; the General Staff has to be mechanized along with
 everything else. So the Pentagon boys set up IFACS and handed us a
 top-priority cybernetics project: to build a superduper chess player
 that could oversee a complicated military maneuver, maybe later a whole
 campaign, maybe ultimately a whole global war.


 ""We're aiming at a military strategy machine which can digest reports
 from all the units on all the fronts and from moment to moment, on
 the basis of that steady stream of information, grind out an elastic
 overall strategy and dictate concrete tactical directives to all the
 units. Wiener warned this might happen, and he was right. A very nifty
 tool. Never mind how far we've gotten with the thing, but I will tell
 you this: I'm a lot more scared today than I was three years ago.""


 So
that
was the secret of MS! The most extraordinary machine ever
 devised by the human mind! It was hard to conceal the thrill of
 excitement I felt, even as a relative outsider.


 ""Why all the jitters?"" I said. ""This could be the most wonderful tool
 ever invented. It might eliminate war altogether.""


 Len was quiet for a while, gulping his beer and looking off into space.
 Then he turned to me.


 ""Steve Lundy has a cute idea,"" he said. ""He was telling me about it
 this afternoon. He's a bum, you see, but he's got a damned good mind
 and he's done a lot of reading. Among other things, he's smart enough
 to see that once you've got your theory of games worked out, there's
 at least the logical possibility of converting your Eniac into what
 he calls a Strategy Integrator and Computer. And he's guessed, simply
 from the Pentagon's hush-hush policy about it, that that's what we're
 working on here at IFACS. So he holds forth on the subject of Emsiac,
 and I listen.""


 ""What's his idea?"" I asked.


 ""He thinks Emsiac might eliminate war, too, but not in the way a
 Boy Scout might think. What he says is that all the industrialized
 nations must be working away like mad on Emsiac, just as they did on
 the atom bomb, so let's assume that before long all the big countries
 will have more or less equal MS machines. All right. A cold war gets
 under way between countries A and B, and pretty soon it reaches the
 showdown stage. Then both countries plug in their Emsiacs and let them
 calculate the date on which hostilities should begin. If the machines
 are equally efficient, they'll hit on the same date. If there's a
 slight discrepancy, the two countries can work out a compromise date by
 negotiation.


 ""The day arrives. A's Emsiac is set up in its capital, B's is set up
 in
its
capital. In each capital the citizens gather around their
 strategy machine, the officials turn out in high hats and cut-aways,
 there are speeches, pageants, choral singing, mass dancing—the ritual
 can be worked out in advance. Then, at an agreed time, the crowds
 retreat to a safe distance and a committee of the top cyberneticists
 appears. They climb into planes, take off and—this is beautiful—drop
 all their atom bombs and H-bombs on the machines. It happens
 simultaneously in both countries, you see. That's the neat part of it.
 The occasion is called International Mushroom Day.


 ""Then the cyberneticists in both countries go back to their vacuum
 tubes to work on another Emsiac, and the nuclear physicists go back to
 their piles to build more atom bombs, and when they're ready they have
 another Mushroom Day. One Mushroom Day every few years, whenever the
 diplomatic-strategic situation calls for it, and nobody even fires a
 B-B gun. Scientific war. Isn't it wonderful?""

Mercury had no atmosphere—everyone knew

 that. Why was it developing one now?
I


 The wind which had nearly turned the
Albireo's
landing into a
 disaster instead of a mathematical exercise was still playing tunes
 about the fins and landing legs as Schlossberg made his way down to
 Deck Five.


 The noise didn't bother him particularly, though the endless seismic
 tremors made him dislike the ladders. But just now he was able to
 ignore both. He was curious—though not hopeful.


 ""Is there anything at all obvious on the last sets of tapes, Joe?""


 Mardikian, the geophysicist, shrugged. ""Just what you'd expect ... on
 a planet which has at least one quake in each fifty-mile-square area
 every five minutes. You know yourself we had a nice seismic program set
 up, but when we touched down we found we couldn't carry it out. We've
 done our best with the natural tremors—incidentally stealing most of
 the record tapes the other projects would have used. We have a lot of
 nice information for the computers back home; but it will take all of
 them to make any sense out of it.""


 Schlossberg nodded; the words had not been necessary. His astronomical
 program had been one of those sabotaged by the transfer of tapes to the
 seismic survey.


 ""I just hoped,"" he said. ""We each have an idea why Mercury developed
 an atmosphere during the last few decades, but I guess the high school
 kids on Earth will know whether it's right before we do. I'm resigned
 to living in a chess-type universe—few and simple rules, but infinite
 combinations of them. But it would be nice to know an answer sometime.""


 ""So it would. As a matter of fact, I need to know a couple right now.
 From you. How close to finished are the other programs—or what's left
 of them?""


 ""I'm all set,"" replied Schlossberg. ""I have a couple of instruments
 still monitoring the sun just in case, but everything in the revised
 program is on tape.""


 ""Good. Tom, any use asking you?""


 The biologist grimaced. ""I've been shown two hundred and sixteen
 different samples of rock and dust. I have examined in detail twelve
 crystal growths which looked vaguely like vegetation. Nothing was alive
 or contained living things by any standards I could conscientiously
 set.""


 Mardikian's gesture might have meant sympathy.


 ""Camille?""


 ""I may as well stop now as any time. I'll never be through. Tape didn't
 make much difference to me, but I wish I knew what weight of specimens
 I could take home.""


 ""Eileen?"" Mardikian's glance at the stratigrapher took the place of the
 actual question.


 ""Cam speaks for me, except that I could have used any more tape you
 could have spared. What I have is gone.""


 ""All right, that leaves me, the tape-thief. The last spools are in the
 seismographs now, and will start running out in seventeen hours. The
 tractors will start out on their last rounds in sixteen, and should be
 back in roughly a week. Will, does that give you enough to figure the
 weights we rockhounds can have on the return trip?""
The
Albireo's
captain nodded. ""Close enough. There really hasn't been
 much question since it became evident we'd find nothing for the mass
 tanks here. I'll have a really precise check in an hour, but I can
 tell right now that you have about one and a half metric tons to split
 up among the three of you.


 ""Ideal departure time is three hundred ten hours away, as you all know.
 We can stay here until then, or go into a parking-and-survey orbit at
 almost any time before then. You have all the survey you need, I should
 think, from the other time. But suit yourselves.""


 ""I'd just as soon be space-sick as seasick,"" remarked Camille Burkett.
 ""I still hate to think that the entire planet is as shivery as the spot
 we picked.""


 Willard Rowson smiled. ""You researchers told me where to land after ten
 days in orbit mapping this rockball. I set you just where you asked. If
 you'd found even five tons of juice we could use in the reaction tanks
 I could still take you to another one—if you could agree which one. I
 hate to say 'Don't blame me,' but I can't think of anything else that
 fits.""


 ""So we sit until the last of the tractors is back with the precious
 seismo tapes, playing battleship while our back teeth are being
 shaken out by earthquakes—excuse the word. What a thrill! Glorious
 adventure!"" Zaino, the communications specialist who had been out of a
 job almost constantly since the landing, spoke sourly. The captain was
 the only one who saw fit to answer.


 ""If you want adventure, you made a mistake exploring space. The only
 space adventures I've heard of are second-hand stories built on
 guesswork; the people who really had them weren't around to tell about
 it. Unless Dr. Marini discovers a set of Mercurian monsters at the last
 minute and they invade the ship or cut off one of the tractors, I'm
 afraid you'll have to do without adventures."" Zaino grimaced.


 ""That sounds funny coming from a spaceman, Captain. I didn't really
 mean adventure, though; all I want is something to do besides betting
 whether the next quake will come in one minute or five. I haven't even
 had to fix a suit-radio since we touched down. How about my going out
 with one of the tractors on this last trip, at least?""


 ""It's all right with me,"" replied Rowson, ""but Dr. Mardikian runs the
 professional part of this operation. I require that Spurr, Trackman,
 Hargedon and Aiello go as drivers, since without them even a minor
 mechanical problem would be more than an adventure. As I recall it, Dr.
 Harmon, Dr. Schlossberg, Dr. Marini and Dr. Mardikian are scheduled to
 go; but if any one of them is willing to let you take his or her place,
 I certainly don't mind.""


 The radioman looked around hopefully. The geologists and the biologist
 shook their heads negatively, firmly and unanimously; but the
 astronomer pondered for a moment. Zaino watched tensely.


 ""It may be all right,"" Schlossberg said at last. ""What I want to get
 is a set of wind, gas pressure, gas temperature and gas composition
 measures around the route. I didn't expect to be more meteorologist
 than astronomer when we left Earth, and didn't have exactly the right
 equipment. Hargedon and Aiello helped me improvise some, and this is
 the first chance to use it on Darkside. If you can learn what has to be
 done with it before starting time, though, you are welcome to my place.""
The communicator got to his feet fast enough to leave the deck in
 Mercury's feeble gravity.


 ""Lead me to it, Doc. I guess I can learn to read a home-made
 weathervane!""


 ""Is that merely bragging, or a challenge?"" drawled a voice which had
 not previously joined the discussion. Zaino flushed a bit.


 ""Sorry, Luigi,"" he said hastily. ""I didn't mean it just that way. But I
 still think I can run the stuff.""


 ""Likely enough,"" Aiello replied. ""Remember though, it wasn't made just
 for talking into."" Schlossberg, now on his feet, cut in quickly.


 ""Come on, Arnie. We'll have to suit up to see the equipment; it's
 outside.""


 He shepherded the radioman to the hatch at one side of the deck and
 shooed him down toward the engine and air lock levels. Both were silent
 for some moments; but safely out of earshot of Deck Five the younger
 man looked up and spoke.


 ""You needn't push, Doc. I wasn't going to make anything of it. Luigi
 was right, and I asked for it."" The astronomer slowed a bit in his
 descent.


 ""I wasn't really worried,"" he replied, ""but we have several months yet
 before we can get away from each other, and I don't like talk that
 could set up grudges. Matter of fact, I'm even a little uneasy about
 having the girls along, though I'm no misogynist.""


 ""Girls? They're not—""


 ""There goes your foot again. Even Harmon is about ten years older than
 you, I suppose. But they're girls to me. What's more important, they no
 doubt think of themselves as girls.""


 ""Even Dr. Burkett? That is—I mean—""


 ""Even Dr. Burkett. Here, get into your suit. And maybe you'd better
 take out the mike. It'll be enough if you can listen for the next
 hour or two."" Zaino made no answer, suspecting with some justice that
 anything he said would be wrong.


 Each made final checks on the other's suit; then they descended
 one more level to the airlock. This occupied part of the same deck
 as the fusion plants, below the wings and reaction mass tanks but
 above the main engine. Its outer door was just barely big enough to
 admit a spacesuited person. Even with the low air pressure carried
 by spaceships, a large door area meant large total force on jamb,
 hinges and locks. It opened onto a small balcony from which a ladder
 led to the ground. The two men paused on the balcony to look over the
 landscape.


 This hadn't changed noticeably since the last time either had been out,
 though there might have been some small difference in the volcanic
 cones a couple of miles away to the northeast. The furrows down the
 sides of these, which looked as though they had been cut by water but
 were actually bone-dry ash slides, were always undergoing alteration as
 gas from below kept blowing fresh scoria fragments out of the craters.
The spines—steep, jagged fragments of rock which thrust upward from
 the plain beyond and to both sides of the cones—seemed dead as ever.


 The level surface between the
Albireo
and the cones was more
 interesting. Mardikian and Schlossberg believed it to be a lava sheet
 dating from early in Mercury's history, when more volatile substances
 still existed in the surface rocks to cut down their viscosity when
 molten. They supposed that much—perhaps most—of the surface around
 the ""twilight"" belt had been flooded by this very liquid lava, which
 had cooled to a smoother surface than most Earthly lava flows.


 How long it had stayed cool they didn't guess. But both men felt sure
 that Mercury must have periodic upheavals as heat accumulated inside
 it—heat coming not from radioactivity but from tidal energy. Mercury's
 orbit is highly eccentric. At perihelion, tidal force tries to pull it
 apart along the planet-to-sun line, while at aphelion the tidal force
 is less and the little world's own gravity tries to bring it back to
 a spherical shape. The real change in form is not great, but a large
 force working through even a small amount of distance can mean a good
 deal of energy.


 If the energy can't leak out—and Mercury's rocks conduct heat no
 better than those of Earth—the temperature must rise.


 Sooner or later, the men argued, deeply buried rock must fuse to magma.
 Its liquefaction would let the bulk of the planet give farther under
 tidal stress, so heat would be generated even faster. Eventually a
 girdle of magma would have to form far below the crust all around the
 twilight strip, where the tidal strain would be greatest. Sooner or
 later this would melt its way to the surface, giving the zone a period
 of intense volcanic activity and, incidentally, giving the planet a
 temporary atmosphere.


 The idea was reasonable. It had, the astronomer admitted, been
 suggested long before to account for supposed vulcanism on the moon.
 It justified the careful examination that Schlossberg and Zaino gave
 the plain before they descended the ladder; for it made reasonable
 the occasional changes which were observed to occur in the pattern of
 cracks weaving over its surface.


 No one was certain just how permanent the local surface was—though
 no one could really justify feeling safer on board the
Albireo
than
 outside on the lava. If anything really drastic happened, the ship
 would be no protection.


 The sun, hanging just above the horizon slightly to the watcher's
 right, cast long shadows which made the cracks stand out clearly;
 as far as either man could see, nothing had changed recently. They
 descended the ladder carefully—even the best designed spacesuits are
 somewhat vulnerable—and made their way to the spot where the tractors
 were parked.


 A sheet-metal fence a dozen feet high and four times as long provided
 shade, which was more than a luxury this close to the sun. The
 tractors were parked in this shadow, and beside and between them were
 piles of equipment and specimens. The apparatus Schlossberg had devised
 was beside the tractor at the north end of the line, just inside the
 shaded area.


 It was still just inside the shade when they finished, four hours
 later. Hargedon had joined them during the final hour and helped
 pack the equipment in the tractor he was to drive. Zaino had had no
 trouble in learning to make the observations Schlossberg wanted, and
 the youngster was almost unbearably cocky. Schlossberg hoped, as they
 returned to the
Albireo
, that no one would murder the communications
 expert in the next twelve hours. There would be nothing to worry about
 after the trip started; Hargedon was quite able to keep anyone in his
 place without being nasty about it. If Zaino had been going with Aiello
 or Harmon—but he wasn't, and it was pointless to dream up trouble.


 And no trouble developed all by itself.
II


 Zaino was not only still alive but still reasonably popular when
 the first of the tractors set out, carrying Eileen Harmon and Eric
 Trackman, the
Albireo's
nuclear engineer.


 It started more than an hour before the others, since the
 stratigrapher's drilling program, ""done"" or not, took extra time. The
 tractor hummed off to the south, since both Darkside routes required a
 long detour to pass the chasm to the west. Routes had been worked out
 from the stereo-photos taken during the orbital survey. Even Darkside
 had been covered fairly well with Uniquantum film under Venus light.


 The Harmon-Trackman vehicle was well out of sight when Mardikian and
 Aiello started out on one of the Brightside routes, and a few minutes
 later Marini set out on the other with the spacesuit technician, Mary
 Spurr, driving.


 Both vehicles disappeared quickly into a valley to the northeast,
 between the ash cones and a thousand-foot spine which rose just south
 of them. All the tractors were in good radio contact; Zaino made sure
 of that before he abandoned the radio watch to Rowson, suited up and
 joined Hargedon at the remaining one. They climbed in, and Hargedon set
 it in motion.


 At about the same time, the first tractor came into view again, now
 traveling north on the farther side of the chasm. Hargedon took this as
 evidence that the route thus far was unchanged, and kicked in highest
 speed.


 The cabin was pretty cramped, even though some of the equipment had
 been attached outside. The men could not expect much comfort for the
 next week.


 Hargedon was used to the trips, however. He disapproved on principle
 of people who complained about minor inconveniences such as having
 to sleep in spacesuits; fortunately, Zaino's interest and excitement
 overrode any thought he might have had about discomfort.


 This lasted through the time they spent doubling the vast crack in
 Mercury's crust, driving on a little to the north of the ship on the
 other side and then turning west toward the dark hemisphere. The
 route was identical to that of Harmon's machine for some time, though
 no trace of its passage showed on the hard surface. Then Hargedon
 angled off toward the southwest. He had driven this run often enough
 to know it well even without the markers which had been set out with
 the seismographs. The photographic maps were also aboard. With them,
 even Zaino had no trouble keeping track of their progress while they
 remained in sunlight.


 However, the sun sank as they traveled west. In two hours its lower rim
 would have been on the horizon, had they been able to see the horizon;
 as it was, more of the ""sea level"" lava plain was in shadow than not
 even near the ship, and their route now lay in semi-darkness.


 The light came from peaks projecting into the sunlight, from scattered
 sky-light which was growing rapidly fainter and from the brighter
 celestial objects such as Earth. Even with the tractor's lights it was
 getting harder to spot crevasses and seismometer markers. Zaino quickly
 found the fun wearing off ... though his pride made him cover this fact
 as best he could.


 If Hargedon saw this, he said nothing. He set Zaino to picking up
 every other instrument, as any partner would have, making no allowance
 for the work the youngster was doing for Schlossberg. This might, of
 course, have had the purpose of keeping the radioman too busy to think
 about discomfort. Or it might merely have been Hargedon's idea of
 normal procedure.


 Whatever the cause, Zaino got little chance to use the radio once they
 had driven into the darkness. He managed only one or two brief talks
 with those left at the ship.
The talks might have helped his morale, since they certainly must have
 given the impression that nothing was going on in the ship while at
 least he had something to do in the tractor. However, this state of
 affairs did not last. Before the vehicle was four hours out of sight of
 the
Albireo
, a broadcast by Camille Burkett reached them.


 The mineralogist's voice contained at least as much professional
 enthusiasm as alarm, but everyone listening must have thought promptly
 of the dubious stability of Mercury's crust. The call was intended for
 her fellow geologists Mardikian and Harmon. But it interested Zaino at
 least as much.


 ""Joe! Eileen! There's a column of what looks like black smoke rising
 over Northeast Spur. It can't be a real fire, of course; I can't see
 its point of origin, but if it's the convection current it seems to
 be the source must be pretty hot. It's the closest thing to a genuine
 volcano I've seen since we arrived; it's certainly not another of those
 ash mounds. I should think you'd still be close enough to make it out,
 Joe. Can you see anything?""
The reply from Mardikian's tractor was inaudible to Zaino and Hargedon,
 but Burkett's answer made its general tenor plain.


 ""I hadn't thought of that. Yes, I'd say it was pretty close to the
 Brightside route. It wouldn't be practical for you to stop your run now
 to come back to see. You couldn't do much about it anyway. I could go
 out to have a look and then report to you. If the way back is blocked
 there'll be plenty of time to work out another."" Hargedon and Zaino
 passed questioning glances at each other during the shorter pause that
 followed.


 ""I know there aren't,"" the voice then went on, responding to the words
 they could not hear, ""but it's only two or three miles, I'd say. Two
 to the spur and not much farther to where I could see the other side.
 Enough of the way is in shade so I could make it in a suit easily
 enough. I can't see calling back either of the dark-side tractors.
 Their work is just as important as the rest—anyway, Eileen is probably
 out of range. She hasn't answered yet.""


 Another pause.


 ""That's true. Still, it would mean sacrificing that set of seismic
 records—no, wait. We could go out later for those. And Mel could take
 his own weather measures on the later trip. There's plenty of time!""


 Pause, longer this time.


 ""You're right, of course. I just wanted to get an early look at this
 volcano, if it is one. We'll let the others finish their runs, and when
 you get back you can check the thing from the other side yourself. If
 it is blocking your way there's time to find an alternate route. We
 could be doing that from the maps in the meantime, just in case.""


 Zaino looked again at his companion.


 ""Isn't that just my luck!"" he exclaimed. ""I jump at the first chance
 to get away from being bored to death. The minute I'm safely away, the
 only interesting thing of the whole operation happens—back at the
 ship!""


 ""Who asked to come on this trip?""


 ""Oh, I'm not blaming anyone but myself. If I'd stayed back there the
 volcano would have popped out here somewhere, or else waited until we
 were gone.""


 ""If it is a volcano. Dr. Burkett didn't seem quite sure.""


 ""No, and I'll bet a nickel she's suiting up right now to go out and
 see. I hope she comes back with something while we're still near enough
 to hear about it.""


 Hargedon shrugged. ""I suppose it was also just your luck that sent you
 on a Darkside trip? You know the radio stuff. You knew we couldn't
 reach as far this way with the radios. Didn't you think of that in
 advance?""


 ""I didn't think of it, any more than you would have. It was bad luck,
 but I'm not grousing about it. Let's get on with this job."" Hargedon
 nodded with approval, and possibly with some surprise, and the tractor
 hummed on its way.


 The darkness deepened around the patches of lava shown by the driving
 lights; the sky darkened toward a midnight hue, with stars showing
 ever brighter through it; and radio reception from the
Albireo
began to get spotty. Gas density at the ion layer was high enough so
 that recombination of molecules with their radiation-freed electrons
 was rapid. Only occasional streamers of ionized gas reached far over
 Darkside. As these thinned out, so did radio reception. Camille
 Burkett's next broadcast came through very poorly.


 There was enough in it, however, to seize the attention of the two men
 in the tractor.
She was saying: ""—real all right, and dangerous. It's the ... thing I
 ever saw ... kinds of lava from what looks like ... same vent. There's
 high viscosity stuff building a spatter cone to end all spatter cones,
 and some very thin fluid from somewhere at the bottom. The flow has
 already blocked the valley used by the Brightside routes and is coming
 along it. A new return route will have to be found for the tractors
 that ... was spreading fast when I saw it. I can't tell how much will
 come. But unless it stops there's nothing at all to keep the flow away
 from the ship. It isn't coming fast, but it's coming. I'd advise all
 tractors to turn back. Captain Rowson reminds me that only one takeoff
 is possible. If we leave this site, we're committed to leaving Mercury.
 Arnie and Ren, do you hear me?""


 Zaino responded at once. ""We got most of it, Doctor. Do you really
 think the ship is in danger?""


 ""I don't know. I can only say that
if
this flow continues the
 ship will have to leave, because this area will sooner or later be
 covered. I can't guess how likely ... check further to get some sort
 of estimate. It's different from any Earthly lava source—maybe you
 heard—should try to get Eileen and Eric back, too. I can't raise
 them. I suppose they're well out from under the ion layer by now.
 Maybe you're close enough to them to catch them with diffracted waves.
 Try, anyway. Whether you can raise them or not you'd better start back
 yourself.""


 Hargedon cut in at this point. ""What does Dr. Mardikian say about that?
 We still have most of the seismometers on this route to visit.""


 ""I think Captain Rowson has the deciding word here, but if it helps
 your decision Dr. Mardikian has already started back. He hasn't
 finished his route, either. So hop back here, Ren. And Arnie, put that
 technical skill you haven't had to use yet to work raising Eileen and
 Eric.""


 ""What I can do, I will,"" replied Zaino, ""but you'd better tape a recall
 message and keep it going out on. Let's see—band F.""


 ""All right. I'll be ready to check the volcano as soon as you get back.
 How long?""


 ""Seven hours—maybe six and a half,"" replied Hargedon. ""We have to be
 careful.""


 ""Very well. Stay outside when you arrive; I'll want to go right out in
 the tractor to get a closer look."" She cut off.


 ""And
that
came through clearly enough!"" remarked Hargedon as he swung
 the tractor around. ""I've been awake for fourteen hours, driving off
 and on for ten of them; I'm about to drive for another six; and then
 I'm to stand by for more.""


 ""Would you like me to do some of the driving?"" asked Zaino.


 ""I guess you'll have to, whether I like it or not,"" was the rather
 lukewarm reply. ""I'll keep on for awhile, though—until we're back in
 better light. You get at your radio job.""
III


 Zaino tried. Hour after hour he juggled from one band to another. Once
 he had Hargedon stop while he went out to attach a makeshift antenna
 which, he hoped, would change his output from broadcast to some sort
 of beam; after this he kept probing the sky with the ""beam,"" first
 listening to the
Albireo's
broadcast in an effort to find projecting
 wisps of ionosphere and then, whenever he thought he had one, switching
 on his transmitter and driving his own message at it.


 Not once did he complain about lack of equipment or remark how much
 better he could do once he was back at the ship.


 Hargedon's silence began to carry an undercurrent of approval not
 usual in people who spent much time with Zaino. The technician made no
 further reference to the suggestion of switching drivers. They came
 in sight of the
Albireo
and doubled the chasm with Hargedon still at
 the wheel, Zaino still at his radio and both of them still uncertain
 whether any of the calls had gotten through.


 Both had to admit, even before they could see the ship, that Burkett
 had had a right to be impressed.


 The smoke column showed starkly against the sky, blowing back over the
 tractor and blocking the sunlight which would otherwise have glared
 into the driver's eyes. Fine particles fell from it in a steady shower;
 looking back, the men could see tracks left by their vehicle in the
 deposit which had already fallen.


 As they approached the ship the dark pillar grew denser and narrower,
 while the particles raining from it became coarser. In some places the
 ash was drifting into fairly deep piles, giving Hargedon some anxiety
 about possible concealed cracks. The last part of the trip, along the
 edge of the great chasm and around its end, was really dangerous;
 cracks running from its sides were definitely spreading. The two men
 reached the
Albireo
later than Hargedon had promised, and found
 Burkett waiting impatiently with a pile of apparatus beside her.


 She didn't wait for them to get out before starting to organize.


 ""There isn't much here. We'll take off just enough of what you're
 carrying to make room for this. No—wait. I'll have to check some of
 your equipment; I'm going to need one of Milt Schlossberg's gadget's, I
 think, so leave that on. We'll take—""


 ""Excuse me, Doctor,"" cut in Hargedon. ""Our suits need servicing, or at
 least mine will if you want me to drive you. Perhaps Arnie can help you
 load for a while, if you don't think it's too important for him to get
 at the radio—""


 ""Of course. Excuse me. I should have had someone out here to help me
 with this. You two go on in. Ren, please get back as soon as you can. I
 can do the work here; none of this stuff is very heavy.""


 Zaino hesitated as he swung out of the cab. True, there wasn't too
 much to be moved, and it wasn't very heavy in Mercury's gravity,
 and he really should be at the radio; but the thirty-nine-year-old
 mineralogist was a middle-aged lady by his standards, and shouldn't be
 allowed to carry heavy packages....


 ""Get along, Arnie!"" the middle-aged lady interrupted this train of
 thought. ""Eric and Eileen are getting farther away and harder to reach
 every second you dawdle!""
He got, though he couldn't help looking northeast as he went rather
 than where he was going.


 The towering menace in that direction would have claimed anyone's
 attention. The pillar of sable ash was rising straighter, as though
 the wind were having less effect on it. An equally black cone had
 risen into sight beyond Northeast Spur—a cone that must have grown
 to some two thousand feet in roughly ten hours. It had far steeper
 sides than the cinder mounds near it; it couldn't be made of the same
 loose ash. Perhaps it consisted of half-melted particles which were
 fusing together as they fell—that might be what Burkett had meant by
 ""spatter-cone."" Still, if that were the case, the material fountaining
 from the cone's top should be lighting the plain with its incandescence
 rather than casting an inky shadow for its entire height.


 Well, that was a problem for the geologists; Zaino climbed aboard and
 settled to his task.


 The trouble was that he could do very little more here than he could
 in the tractor. He could have improvised longer-wave transmitting
 coils whose radiations would have diffracted a little more effectively
 beyond the horizon, but the receiver on the missing vehicle would
 not have detected them. He had more power at his disposal, but could
 only beam it into empty space with his better antennae. He had better
 equipment for locating any projecting wisps of charged gas which might
 reflect his waves, but he was already located under a solid roof of the
 stuff—the
Albireo
was technically on Brightside. Bouncing his beam
 from this layer still didn't give him the range he needed, as he had
 found both by calculation and trial.


 What he really needed was a relay satellite. The target was simply too
 far around Mercury's sharp curve by now for anything less.


 Zaino's final gesture was to set his transmission beam on the lowest
 frequency the tractor would pick up, aim it as close to the vehicle's
 direction as he could calculate from map and itinerary and set the
 recorded return message going. He told Rowson as much.


 ""Can't think of anything else?"" the captain asked. ""Well, neither can
 I, but of course it's not my field. I'd give a year's pay if I could.
 How long before they should be back in range?""


 ""About four days. A hundred hours, give or take a few. They'll be
 heading back anyway by that time.""


 ""Of course. Well, keep trying.""


 ""I am—or rather, the equipment is. I don't see what else I can do
 unless a really bright idea should suddenly sprout. Is there anywhere
 else I could be useful? I'm as likely to have ideas working as just
 sitting.""


 ""We can keep you busy, all right. But how about taking a transmitter up
 one of those mountains? That would get your wave farther.""


 ""Not as far as it's going already. I'm bouncing it off the ion layer,
 which is higher than any mountain we've seen on Mercury even if it's
 nowhere near as high as Earth's.""


 ""Hmph. All right.""


 ""I could help Ren and Dr. Burkett. I could hang on outside the
 tractor—""


 ""They've already gone. You'd better call them, though, and keep a log
 of what they do.""


 ""All right."" Zaino turned back to his board and with no trouble raised
 the tractor carrying Hargedon and the mineralogist. The latter had been
 trying to call the
Albireo
and had some acid comments about radio
 operators who slept on the job.

It's one thing to laugh at a man because his job is useless
 
and outdated—another to depend on him when it suddenly isn't.
In the northland, deep, and in a great cave, by an everburning fire
 the Warrior sleeps. For this is the resting time, the time of peace,
 and so shall it be for a thousand years. And yet we shall summon him
 again, my children, when we are sore in need, and out of the north he
 will come, and again and again, each time we call, out of the dark and
 the cold, with the fire in his hands, he will come.
—
Scandinavian legend
Throughout the night, thick clouds had been piling in the north; in
 the morning, it was misty and cold. By eight o'clock a wet, heavy,
 snow-smelling breeze had begun to set in, and because the crops were
 all down and the winter planting done, the colonists brewed hot coffee
 and remained inside. The wind blew steadily, icily from the north. It
 was well below freezing when, some time after nine, an army ship landed
 in a field near the settlement.


 There was still time. There were some last brief moments in which the
 colonists could act and feel as they had always done. They therefore
 grumbled in annoyance. They wanted no soldiers here. The few who had
 convenient windows stared out with distaste and a mild curiosity, but
 no one went out to greet them.


 After a while a rather tall, frail-looking man came out of the ship
 and stood upon the hard ground looking toward the village. He remained
 there, waiting stiffly, his face turned from the wind. It was a silly
 thing to do. He was obviously not coming in, either out of pride or
 just plain orneriness.


 ""Well, I never,"" a nice lady said.


 ""What's he just
standing
there for?"" another lady said.


 And all of them thought: well, God knows what's in the mind of a
 soldier, and right away many people concluded that he must be drunk.
 The seed of peace was deeply planted in these people, in the children
 and the women, very, very deep. And because they had been taught, oh so
 carefully, to hate war they had also been taught, quite incidentally,
 to despise soldiers.


 The lone man kept standing in the freezing wind.
Eventually, because even a soldier can look small and cold and
 pathetic, Bob Rossel had to get up out of a nice, warm bed and go out
 in that miserable cold to meet him.


 The soldier saluted. Like most soldiers, he was not too neat and not
 too clean and the salute was sloppy. Although he was bigger than
 Rossel he did not seem bigger. And, because of the cold, there were
 tears gathering in the ends of his eyes.


 ""Captain Dylan, sir."" His voice was low and did not carry. ""I have a
 message from Fleet Headquarters. Are you in charge here?""


 Rossel, a small sober man, grunted. ""Nobody's in charge here. If you
 want a spokesman I guess I'll do. What's up?""


 The captain regarded him briefly out of pale blue, expressionless eyes.
 Then he pulled an envelope from an inside pocket, handed it to Rossel.
 It was a thick, official-looking thing and Rossel hefted it idly. He
 was about to ask again what was it all about when the airlock of the
 hovering ship swung open creakily. A beefy, black-haired young man
 appeared unsteadily in the doorway, called to Dylan.


 ""C'n I go now, Jim?""


 Dylan turned and nodded.


 ""Be back for you tonight,"" the young man called, and then, grinning,
 he yelled ""Catch"" and tossed down a bottle. The captain caught it and
 put it unconcernedly into his pocket while Rossel stared in disgust. A
 moment later the airlock closed and the ship prepared to lift.


 ""Was he
drunk
?"" Rossel began angrily. ""Was that a bottle of
liquor
?""


 The soldier was looking at him calmly, coldly. He indicated the
 envelope in Rossel's hand. ""You'd better read that and get moving. We
 haven't much time.""


 He turned and walked toward the buildings and Rossel had to follow. As
 Rossel drew near the walls the watchers could see his lips moving but
 could not hear him. Just then the ship lifted and they turned to watch
 that, and followed it upward, red spark-tailed, into the gray spongy
 clouds and the cold.
After a while the ship went out of sight, and nobody ever saw it again.
The first contact Man had ever had with an intelligent alien race
 occurred out on the perimeter in a small quiet place a long way from
 home. Late in the year 2360—the exact date remains unknown—an alien
 force attacked and destroyed the colony at Lupus V. The wreckage and
 the dead were found by a mailship which flashed off screaming for the
 army.


 When the army came it found this: Of the seventy registered colonists,
 thirty-one were dead. The rest, including some women and children,
 were missing. All technical equipment, all radios, guns, machines,
 even books, were also missing. The buildings had been burned, so were
 the bodies. Apparently the aliens had a heat ray. What else they had,
 nobody knew. After a few days of walking around in the ash, one soldier
 finally stumbled on something.


 For security reasons, there was a detonator in one of the main
 buildings. In case of enemy attack, Security had provided a bomb to be
 buried in the center of each colony, because it was important to blow
 a whole village to hell and gone rather than let a hostile alien learn
 vital facts about human technology and body chemistry. There was a bomb
 at Lupus V too, and though it had been detonated it had not blown. The
 detonating wire had been cut.


 In the heart of the camp, hidden from view under twelve inches of
 earth, the wire had been dug up and cut.


 The army could not understand it and had no time to try. After five
 hundred years of peace and anti-war conditioning the army was small,
 weak and without respect. Therefore, the army did nothing but spread
 the news, and Man began to fall back.


 In a thickening, hastening stream he came back from the hard-won
 stars, blowing up his homes behind him, stunned and cursing. Most of
 the colonists got out in time. A few, the farthest and loneliest, died
 in fire before the army ships could reach them. And the men in those
 ships, drinkers and gamblers and veterans of nothing, the dregs of a
 society which had grown beyond them, were for a long while the only
 defense Earth had.


 This was the message Captain Dylan had brought, come out from Earth
 with a bottle on his hip.
An obscenely cheerful expression upon his gaunt, not too well shaven
 face, Captain Dylan perched himself upon the edge of a table and
 listened, one long booted leg swinging idly. One by one the colonists
 were beginning to understand. War is huge and comes with great
 suddenness and always without reason, and there is inevitably a wait,
 between acts, between the news and the motion, the fear and the rage.


 Dylan waited. These people were taking it well, much better than those
 in the cities had taken it. But then, these were pioneers. Dylan
 grinned. Pioneers. Before you settle a planet you boil it and bake
 it and purge it of all possible disease. Then you step down gingerly
 and inflate your plastic houses, which harden and become warm and
 impregnable; and send your machines out to plant and harvest; and set
 up automatic factories to transmute dirt into coffee; and, without ever
 having lifted a finger, you have braved the wilderness, hewed a home
 out of the living rock and become a pioneer. Dylan grinned again. But
 at least this was better than the wailing of the cities.


 This Dylan thought, although he was himself no fighter, no man at all
 by any standards. This he thought because he was a soldier and an
 outcast; to every drunken man the fall of the sober is a happy thing.
 He stirred restlessly.


 By this time the colonists had begun to realize that there wasn't much
 to say, and a tall, handsome woman was murmuring distractedly: ""Lupus,
 Lupus—doesn't that mean wolves or something?""


 Dylan began to wish they would get moving, these pioneers. It was very
 possible that the aliens would be here soon, and there was no need for
 discussion. There was only one thing to do and that was to clear the
 hell out, quickly and without argument. They began to see it.


 But, when the fear had died down, the resentment came. A number of
 women began to cluster around Dylan and complain, working up their
 anger. Dylan said nothing. Then the man Rossel pushed forward and
 confronted him, speaking with a vast annoyance.


 ""See here, soldier, this is our planet. I mean to say, this is our
home
. We demand some protection from the fleet. By God, we've been
 paying the freight for you boys all these years and it's high time you
 earned your keep. We demand....""


 It went on and on while Dylan looked at the clock and waited. He hoped
 that he could end this quickly. A big gloomy man was in front of him
 now and giving him that name of ancient contempt, ""soldier boy."" The
 gloomy man wanted to know where the fleet was.


 ""There is no fleet. There are a few hundred half-shot old tubs that
 were obsolete before you were born. There are four or five new jobs for
 the brass and the government. That's all the fleet there is.""
Dylan wanted to go on about that, to remind them that nobody had wanted
 the army, that the fleet had grown smaller and smaller ... but this was
 not the time. It was ten-thirty already and the damned aliens might be
 coming in right now for all he knew, and all they did was talk. He had
 realized a long time ago that no peace-loving nation in the history
 of Earth had ever kept itself strong, and although peace was a noble
 dream, it was ended now and it was time to move.


 ""We'd better get going,"" he finally said, and there was quiet.
 ""Lieutenant Bossio has gone on to your sister colony at Planet Three of
 this system. He'll return to pick me up by nightfall and I'm instructed
 to have you gone by then.""


 For a long moment they waited, and then one man abruptly walked off and
 the rest followed quickly; in a moment they were all gone. One or two
 stopped long enough to complain about the fleet, and the big gloomy man
 said he wanted guns, that's all, and there wouldn't nobody get him off
 his planet. When he left, Dylan breathed with relief and went out to
 check the bomb, grateful for the action.


 Most of it had to be done in the open. He found a metal bar in the
 radio shack and began chopping at the frozen ground, following the
 wire. It was the first thing he had done with his hands in weeks, and
 it felt fine.


 Dylan had been called up out of a bar—he and Bossio—and told what had
 happened, and in three weeks now they had cleared four colonies. This
 would be the last, and the tension here was beginning to get to him.
 After thirty years of hanging around and playing like the town drunk,
 a man could not be expected to rush out and plug the breach, just like
 that. It would take time.


 He rested, sweating, took a pull from the bottle on his hip.


 Before they sent him out on this trip they had made him a captain.
 Well, that was nice. After thirty years he was a captain. For thirty
 years he had bummed all over the west end of space, had scraped his way
 along the outer edges of Mankind, had waited and dozed and patrolled
 and got drunk, waiting always for something to happen. There were a lot
 of ways to pass the time while you waited for something to happen, and
 he had done them all.


 Once he had even studied military tactics.


 He could not help smiling at that, even now. Damn it, he'd been green.
 But he'd been only nineteen when his father died—of a hernia, of a
 crazy fool thing like a hernia that killed him just because he'd worked
 too long on a heavy planet—and in those days the anti-war conditioning
 out on the Rim was not very strong. They talked a lot about guardians
 of the frontier, and they got him and some other kids and a broken-down
 doctor. And ... now he was a captain.


 He bent his back savagely, digging at the ground. You wait and you wait
 and the edge goes off. This thing he had waited for all those damn days
 was upon him now and there was nothing he could do but say the hell
 with it and go home. Somewhere along the line, in some dark corner of
 the bars or the jails, in one of the million soul-murdering insults
 which are reserved especially for peacetime soldiers, he had lost the
 core of himself, and it didn't particularly matter. That was the point:
 it made no particular difference if he never got it back. He owed
 nobody. He was tugging at the wire and trying to think of something
 pleasant from the old days, when the wire came loose in his hands.


 Although he had been, in his cynical way, expecting it, for a moment it
 threw him and he just stared. The end was clean and bright. The wire
 had just been cut.
Dylan sat for a long while by the radio shack, holding the ends in his
 hands. He reached almost automatically for the bottle on his hip and
 then, for the first time he could remember, let it go. This was real,
 there was no time for that.


 When Rossel came up, Dylan was still sitting. Rossel was so excited he
 did not notice the wire.


 ""Listen, soldier, how many people can your ship take?""


 Dylan looked at him vaguely. ""She sleeps two and won't take off with
 more'n ten. Why?""


 His eyes bright and worried, Rossel leaned heavily against the shack.
 ""We're overloaded. There are sixty of us and our ship will only take
 forty. We came out in groups, we never thought....""


 Dylan dropped his eyes, swearing silently. ""You're sure? No baggage, no
 iron rations; you couldn't get ten more on?""


 ""Not a chance. She's only a little ship with one deck—she's all we
 could afford.""


 Dylan whistled. He had begun to feel light-headed. ""It 'pears that
 somebody's gonna find out first hand what them aliens look like.""


 It was the wrong thing to say and he knew it. ""All right,"" he said
 quickly, still staring at the clear-sliced wire, ""we'll do what we can.
 Maybe the colony on Three has room. I'll call Bossio and ask.""


 The colonist had begun to look quite pitifully at the buildings around
 him and the scurrying people.


 ""Aren't there any fleet ships within radio distance?""


 Dylan shook his head. ""The fleet's spread out kind of thin nowadays.""
 Because the other was leaning on him he felt a great irritation, but
 he said, as kindly as he could, ""We'll get 'em all out. One way or
 another, we won't leave anybody.""


 It was then that Rossel saw the wire. Thickly, he asked what had
 happened.


 Dylan showed him the two clean ends. ""Somebody dug it up, cut it, then
 buried it again and packed it down real nice.""


 ""The damn fool!"" Rossel exploded.


 ""Who?""


 ""Why, one of ... of us, of course. I know nobody ever liked sitting on
 a live bomb like this, but I never....""


 ""You think one of your people did it?""


 Rossel stared at him. ""Isn't that obvious?""


 ""Why?""


 ""Well, they probably thought it was too dangerous, and silly too, like
 most government rules. Or maybe one of the kids....""
It was then that Dylan told him about the wire on Lupus V. Rossel was
 silent. Involuntarily, he glanced at the sky, then he said shakily,
 ""Maybe an animal?""


 Dylan shook his head. ""No animal did that. Wouldn't have buried it, or
 found it in the first place. Heck of a coincidence, don't you think?
 The wire at Lupus was cut just before an alien attack, and now this one
 is cut too—newly cut.""


 The colonist put one hand to his mouth, his eyes wide and white.


 ""So something,"" said Dylan, ""knew enough about this camp to know that
 a bomb was buried here and also to know why it was here. And that
 something didn't want the camp destroyed and so came right into the
 center of the camp, traced the wire, dug it up and cut it. And then
 walked right out again.""


 ""Listen,"" said Rossel, ""I'd better go ask.""


 He started away but Dylan caught his arm.


 ""Tell them to arm,"" he said, ""and try not to scare hell out of them.
 I'll be with you as soon as I've spliced this wire.""


 Rossel nodded and went off, running. Dylan knelt with the metal in his
 hands.


 He began to feel that, by God, he was getting cold. He realized that
 he'd better go inside soon, but the wire had to be spliced. That was
 perhaps the most important thing he could do now, splice the wire.


 All right, he asked himself for the thousandth time, who cut it? How?
 Telepathy? Could they somehow control one of us?


 No. If they controlled one, then they could control all, and then there
 would be no need for an attack. But you don't know, you don't really
 know.


 Were they small? Little animals?


 Unlikely. Biology said that really intelligent life required a sizable
 brain and you would have to expect an alien to be at least as large
 as a dog. And every form of life on this planet had been screened long
 before a colony had been allowed in. If any new animals had suddenly
 shown up, Rossel would certainly know about it.


 He would ask Rossel. He would damn sure have to ask Rossel.


 He finished splicing the wire and tucked it into the ground. Then he
 straightened up and, before he went into the radio shack, he pulled out
 his pistol. He checked it, primed it, and tried to remember the last
 time he had fired it. He never had—he never had fired a gun.
The snow began falling near noon. There was nothing anybody could do
 but stand in the silence and watch it come down in a white rushing
 wall, and watch the trees and the hills drown in the whiteness, until
 there was nothing on the planet but the buildings and a few warm lights
 and the snow.


 By one o'clock the visibility was down to zero and Dylan decided to
 try to contact Bossio again and tell him to hurry. But Bossio still
 didn't answer. Dylan stared long and thoughtfully out the window
 through the snow at the gray shrouded shapes of bushes and trees which
 were beginning to become horrifying. It must be that Bossio was still
 drunk—maybe sleeping it off before making planetfall on Three. Dylan
 held no grudge. Bossio was a kid and alone. It took a special kind
 of guts to take a ship out into space alone, when Things could be
 waiting....


 A young girl, pink and lovely in a thick fur jacket, came into the
 shack and told him breathlessly that her father, Mr. Rush, would like
 to know if he wanted sentries posted. Dylan hadn't thought about it but
 he said yes right away, beginning to feel both pleased and irritated at
 the same time, because now they were coming to him.


 He pushed out into the cold and went to find Rossel. With the snow it
 was bad enough, but if they were still here when the sun went down they
 wouldn't have a chance. Most of the men were out stripping down their
 ship and that would take a while. He wondered why Rossel hadn't yet put
 a call through to Three, asking about room on the ship there. The only
 answer he could find was that Rossel knew that there was no room, and
 he wanted to put off the answer as long as possible. And, in a way, you
 could not blame him.


 Rossel was in his cabin with the big, gloomy man—who turned out to
 be Rush, the one who had asked about sentries. Rush was methodically
 cleaning an old hunting rifle. Rossel was surprisingly full of hope.


 ""Listen, there's a mail ship due in, been due since yesterday. We might
 get the rest of the folks out on that.""


 Dylan shrugged. ""Don't count on it.""


 ""But they have a contract!""


 The soldier grinned.


 The big man, Rush, was paying no attention. Quite suddenly he said:
 ""Who cut that wire, Cap?""
Dylan swung slowly to look at him. ""As far as I can figure, an alien
 cut it.""


 Rush shook his head. ""No. Ain't been no aliens near this camp, and
 no peculiar animals either. We got a planet-wide radar, and ain't no
 unidentified ships come near, not since we first landed more'n a year
 ago."" He lifted the rifle and peered through the bore. ""Uh-uh. One of
 us did it.""


 The man had been thinking. And he knew the planet.


 ""Telepathy?"" asked Dylan.


 ""Might be.""


 ""Can't see it. You people live too close, you'd notice right away if
 one of you wasn't ... himself. And, if they've got one, why not all?""


 Rush calmly—at least outwardly calmly—lit his pipe. There was a
 strength in this man that Dylan had missed before.


 ""Don't know,"" he said gruffly. ""But these are aliens, mister. And until
 I know different I'm keepin' an eye on my neighbor.""


 He gave Rossel a sour look and Rossel stared back, uncomprehending.


 Then Rossel jumped. ""My God!""


 Dylan moved to quiet him. ""Look, is there any animal at all that ever
 comes near here that's as large as a dog?""


 After a pause, Rush answered. ""Yep, there's one. The viggle. It's like
 a reg'lar monkey but with four legs. Biology cleared 'em before we
 landed. We shoot one now and then when they get pesky."" He rose slowly,
 the rifle held under his arm. ""I b'lieve we might just as well go post
 them sentries.""


 Dylan wanted to go on with this but there was nothing much else to
 say. Rossel went with them as far as the radio shack, with a strained
 expression on his face, to put through that call to Three.


 When he was gone Rush asked Dylan, ""Where you want them sentries? I got
 Walt Halloran and Web Eggers and six others lined up.""


 Dylan stopped and looked around grimly at the circling wall of snow.
 ""You know the site better than I do. Post 'em in a ring, on rises,
 within calling distance. Have 'em check with each other every five
 minutes. I'll go help your people at the ship.""


 The gloomy man nodded and fluffed up his collar. ""Nice day for
 huntin',"" he said, and then he was gone with the snow quickly covering
 his footprints.
The Alien lay wrapped in a thick electric cocoon, buried in a wide
 warm room beneath the base of a tree. The tree served him as antennae;
 curiously he gazed into a small view-screen and watched the humans
 come. He saw them fan out, eight of them, and sink down in the snow. He
 saw that they were armed.
He pulsed thoughtfully, extending a part of himself to absorb a spiced
 lizard. Since the morning, when the new ship had come, he had been
 watching steadily, and now it was apparent that the humans were aware
 of their danger. Undoubtedly they were preparing to leave.


 That was unfortunate. The attack was not scheduled until late that
 night and he could not, of course, press the assault by day. But
flexibility
, he reminded himself sternly,
is the first principle of
 absorption
, and therefore he moved to alter his plans. A projection
 reached out to dial several knobs on a large box before him, and the
 hour of assault was moved forward to dusk. A glance at the chronometer
 told him that it was already well into the night on Planet Three, and
 that the attack there had probably begun.


 The Alien felt the first tenuous pulsing of anticipation. He lay
 quietly, watching the small square lights of windows against the snow,
 thanking the Unexplainable that matters had been so devised that he
 would not have to venture out into that miserable cold.


 Presently an alarming thought struck him. These humans moved with
 uncommon speed for intelligent creatures. Even without devices, it was
 distinctly possible that they could be gone before nightfall. He could
 take no chance, of course. He spun more dials and pressed a single
 button, and lay back again comfortably, warmly, to watch the disabling
 of the colonists' ship.
When Three did not answer, Rossel was nervously gazing at the snow,
 thinking of other things, and he called again. Several moments later
 the realization of what was happening struck him like a blow. Three
 had never once failed to answer. All they had to do when they heard
 the signal buzz was go into the radio shack and say hello. That was
 all they had to do. He called again and again, but nobody answered.
 There was no static and no interference and he didn't hear a thing. He
 checked frenziedly through his own apparatus and tried again, but the
 air was as dead as deep space. He raced out to tell Dylan.


 Dylan accepted it. He had known none of the people on Three and what
 he felt now was a much greater urgency to be out of here. He said
 hopeful things to Rossel, and then went out to the ship and joined the
 men in lightening her. About the ship at least, he knew something and
 he was able to tell them what partitions and frames could go and what
 would have to stay or the ship would never get off the planet. But
 even stripped down, it couldn't take them all. When he knew that, he
 realized that he himself would have to stay here, for it was only then
 that he thought of Bossio.


 Three was dead. Bossio had gone down there some time ago and, if Three
 was dead and Bossio had not called, then the fact was that Bossio was
 gone too. For a long, long moment Dylan stood rooted in the snow.
 More than the fact that he would have to stay here was the unspoken,
 unalterable, heart-numbing knowledge that Bossio was dead—the one
 thing that Dylan could not accept. Bossio was the only friend he had.
 In all this dog-eared, aimless, ape-run Universe Bossio was all his
 friendship and his trust.


 He left the ship blindly and went back to the settlement. Now the
 people were quiet and really frightened, and some of the women were
 beginning to cry. He noticed now that they had begun to look at him
 with hope as he passed, and in his own grief, humanly, he swore.


 Bossio—a big-grinning kid with no parents, no enemies, no
 grudges—Bossio was already dead because he had come out here and tried
 to help these people. People who had kicked or ignored him all the days
 of his life. And, in a short while, Dylan would also stay behind and
 die to save the life of somebody he never knew and who, twenty-four
 hours earlier, would have been ashamed to be found in his company. Now,
 when it was far, far too late, they were coming to the army for help.
But in the end, damn it, he could not hate these people. All they had
 ever wanted was peace, and even though they had never understood that
 the Universe is unknowable and that you must always have big shoulders,
 still they had always sought only for peace. If peace leads to no
 conflict at all and then decay, well, that was something that had to be
 learned. So he could not hate these people.


 But he could not help them either. He turned from their eyes and went
 into the radio shack. It had begun to dawn on the women that they might
 be leaving without their husbands or sons, and he did not want to see
 the fierce struggle that he was sure would take place. He sat alone and
 tried, for the last time, to call Bossio.


 After a while, an old woman found him and offered him coffee. It was
 a very decent thing to do, to think of him at a time like this, and
 he was so suddenly grateful he could only nod. The woman said that he
 must be cold in that thin army thing and that she had brought along a
 mackinaw for him. She poured the coffee and left him alone.


 They were thinking of him now, he knew, because they were thinking of
 everyone who had to stay. Throw the dog a bone. Dammit, don't be like
 that, he told himself. He had not had anything to eat all day and the
 coffee was warm and strong. He decided he might be of some help at the
 ship.


 It was stripped down now and they were loading. He was startled to see
 a great group of them standing in the snow, removing their clothes.
 Then he understood. The clothes of forty people would change the
 weight by enough to get a few more aboard. There was no fighting. Some
 of the women were almost hysterical and a few had refused to go and
 were still in their cabins, but the process was orderly. Children went
 automatically, as did the youngest husbands and all the women. The
 elders were shuffling around in the snow, waving their arms to keep
 themselves warm. Some of them were laughing to keep their spirits up.


 In the end, the ship took forty-six people.


 Rossel was one of the ones that would not be going. Dylan saw him
 standing by the airlock holding his wife in his arms, his face buried
 in her soft brown hair. A sense of great sympathy, totally unexpected,
 rose up in Dylan, and a little of the lostness of thirty years went
 slipping away. These were his people. It was a thing he had never
 understood before, because he had never once been among men in great
 trouble. He waited and watched, learning, trying to digest this while
 there was still time. Then the semi-naked colonists were inside and
 the airlock closed. But when the ship tried to lift, there was a sharp
 burning smell—she couldn't get off the ground.

TOURNAMENT UNDER NIGHTMARE SKIES


 When Kit Temple was drafted for the Nowhere Journey, he figured that
 he'd left his home, his girl, and the Earth for good. For though those
 called were always promised ""rotation,"" not a man had ever returned
 from that mysterious flight into the unknown.


 Kit's fellow-draftee Arkalion, the young man with the strange, old-man
 eyes, seemed to know more than he should. So when Kit twisted the tail
 of fate and followed Arkalion to the ends of space and time, he found
 the secret behind ""Nowhere"" and a personal challenge upon which the
 entire future of Earth depended.
Contents
CHAPTER I
When the first strong sunlight of May covered the tree-arched avenues
 of Center City with green, the riots started.


 The people gathered in angry knots outside the city hall, met in the
 park and littered its walks with newspapers and magazines as they
 gobbled up editorial comment at a furious rate, slipped with dark of
 night through back alleys and planned things with furious futility.
 Center City's finest knew when to make themselves scarce: their
 uniforms stood for everything objectionable at this time and they might
 be subjected to clubs, stones, taunts, threats, leers—and knives.


 But Center City, like most communities in United North America,
 had survived the Riots before and would survive them again. On
 past performances, the damage could be estimated, too. Two-hundred
 fifty-seven plate glass windows would be broken, three-hundred twelve
 limbs fractured. Several thousand people would be treated for minor
 bruises and abrasions, Center City would receive half that many damage
 suits. The list had been drawn clearly and accurately; it hardly ever
 deviated.


 And Center City would meet its quota. With a demonstration of
 reluctance, of course. The healthy approved way to get over social
 trauma once every seven-hundred eighty days.
""Shut it off, Kit. Kit, please.""


 The telio blared in a cheaply feminine voice, ""Oh, it's a long way
 to nowhere, forever. And your honey's not coming back, never, never,
 never...."" A wailing trumpet represented flight.


 ""They'll exploit anything, Kit.""


 ""It's just a song.""


 ""Turn it off, please.""


 Christopher Temple turned off the telio, smiling. ""They'll announce the
 names in ten minutes,"" he said, and felt the corners of his mouth draw
 taut.


 ""Tell me again, Kit,"" Stephanie pleaded. ""How old are you?""


 ""You know I'm twenty-six.""


 ""Twenty-six. Yes, twenty-six, so if they don't call you this time,
 you'll be safe. Safe, I can hardly believe it.""


 ""Nine minutes,"" said Temple in the darkness. Stephanie had drawn the
 blinds earlier, had dialed for sound-proofing. The screaming in the
 streets came to them as not the faintest whisper. But the song which
 became briefly, masochistically popular every two years and two months
 had spoiled their feeling of seclusion.


 ""Tell me again, Kit.""


 ""What.""


 ""You know what.""


 He let her come to him, let her hug him fiercely and whimper against
 his chest. He remained passive although it hurt, occasionally stroking
 her hair. He could not assert himself for another—he looked at his
 strap chrono—for another eight minutes. He might regret it, if he did,
 for a lifetime.


 ""Tell me, Kit.""


 ""I'll marry you, Steffy. In eight minutes, less than eight minutes,
 I'll go down and get the license. We'll marry as soon as it's legal.""


 ""This is the last time they have a chance for you. I mean, they won't
 change the law?""


 Temple shook his head. ""They don't have to. They meet their quota this
 way.""


 ""I'm scared.""


 ""You and everyone else in North America, Steffy.""


 She was trembling against him. ""It's cold for June.""


 ""It's warm in here."" He kissed her moist eyes, her nose, her lips.


 ""Oh God, Kit. Five minutes.""


 ""Five minutes to freedom,"" he said jauntily. He did not feel that way
 at all. Apprehension clutched at his chest with tight, painful fingers,
 almost making it difficult for him to breathe.


 ""Turn it on, Kit.""


 He dialed the telio in time to see the announcer's insincere smile.
 Smile seventeen, Kit thought wryly. Patriotic sacrifice.


 ""Every seven-hundred eighty days,"" said the announcer, ""two-hundred
 of Center City's young men are selected to serve their country for an
 indeterminate period regulated rigidly by a rotation system.""


 ""Liar!"" Stephanie cried. ""No one ever comes back. It's been thirty
 years since the first group and not one of them....""


 ""Shh,"" Temple raised a finger to his lips.


 ""This is the thirteenth call since the inception of what is popularly
 referred to as the Nowhere Journey,"" said the announcer. ""Obviously,
 the two hundred young men from Center City and the thousands from all
 over this hemisphere do not in reality embark on a Journey to Nowhere.
 That is quite meaningless.""


 ""Hooray for him,"" Temple laughed.


 ""I wish he'd get on with it.""


 ""No, ladies and gentlemen, we use the word Nowhere merely because we
 are not aware of the ultimate destination. Security reasons make it
 impossible to....""


 ""Yes, yes,"" said Stephanie impatiently. ""Go on.""


 ""... therefore, the Nowhere Journey. With a maximum security lid on
 the whole project, we don't even know why our men are sent, or by what
 means. We know only that they go somewhere and not nowhere, bravely and
 not fearfully, for a purpose vital to the security of this nation and
 not to slake the thirst of a chessman of regiments and divisions.


 ""If Center City's contribution helps keep our country strong, Center
 City is naturally obligated....""


 ""No one ever said it isn't our duty,"" Stephanie argued, as if the
 announcer could indeed hear her. ""We only wish we knew something about
 it—and we wish it weren't forever.""


 ""It isn't forever,"" Temple reminded her. ""Not officially.""


 ""Officially, my foot. If they never return, they never return. If
 there's a rotation system on paper, but it's never used, that's not a
 rotation system at all. Kit, it's forever.""


 ""... to thank the following sponsors for relinquishing their time....""


 ""No one would want to sponsor
that
,"" Temple whispered cheerfully.


 ""Kit,"" said Stephanie, ""I—I suddenly have a hunch we have nothing to
 worry about. They missed you all along and they'll miss you this time,
 too. The last time, and then you'll be too old. That's funny, too old
 at twenty-six. But we'll be free, Kit. Free.""


 ""He's starting,"" Temple told her.


 A large drum filled the entire telio screen. It rotated slowly from
 bottom to top. In twenty seconds, the letter A appeared, followed by
 about a dozen names. Abercrombie, Harold. Abner, Eugene. Adams, Gerald.
 Sorrow in the Abercrombie household. Despair for the Abners. Black
 horror for Adams.


 The drum rotated.


 ""They're up to F, Kit.""


 Fabian, Gregory G....


 Names circled the drum slowly, live viscous alphabet soup. Meaningless,
 unless you happened to know them.


 ""Kit, I knew Thomas Mulvany.""


 N, O, P....


 ""It's hot in here.""


 ""I thought you were cold.""


 ""I'm suffocating now.""


 R, S....


 ""T!"" Stephanie shrieked as the names began to float slowly up from the
 bottom of the drum.


 Tabor, Tebbets, Teddley....


 Temple's mouth felt dry as a ball of cotton. Stephanie laughed
 nervously. Now—or never. Never?


 Now.


 Stephanie whimpered despairingly.


 TEMPLE, CHRISTOPHER.
""Sorry I'm late, Mr. Jones.""


 ""Hardly, Mr. Smith. Hardly. Three minutes late.""


 ""I've come in response to your ad.""


 ""I know. You look old.""


 ""I am over twenty-six. Do you mind?""


 ""Not if you don't, Mr. Smith. Let me look at you. Umm, you seem the
 right height, the right build.""


 ""I meet the specifications exactly.""


 ""Good, Mr. Smith. And your price.""


 ""No haggling,"" said Smith. ""I have a price which must be met.""


 ""Your price, Mr. Smith?""


 ""Ten million dollars.""


 The man called Jones coughed nervously. ""That's high.""


 ""Very. Take it or leave it.""


 ""In cash?""


 ""Definitely. Small unmarked bills.""


 ""You'd need a moving van!""


 ""Then I'll get one.""


 ""Ten million dollars,"" said Jones, ""is quite a price. Admittedly, I
 haven't dealt in this sort of traffic before, but—""


 ""But nothing. Were your name Jones, really and truly Jones, I might ask
 less.""


 ""Sir?""


 ""You are Jones exactly as much as I am Smith.""


 ""Sir?"" Jones gasped again.


 Smith coughed discreetly. ""But I have one advantage. I know you. You
 don't know me, Mr. Arkalion.""


 ""Eh? Eh?""


 ""Arkalion. The North American Carpet King. Right?""


 ""How did you know?"" the man whose name was not Jones but Arkalion asked
 the man whose name was not Smith but might as well have been.


 ""When I saw your ad,"" said not-Smith, ""I said to myself, 'now here must
 be a very rich, influential man.' It only remained for me to study a
 series of photographs readily obtainable—I have a fine memory for
 that, Mr. Arkalion—and here you are; here is Arkalion the Carpet King.""


 ""What will you do with the ten million dollars?"" demanded Arkalion,
 not minding the loss nearly so much as the ultimate disposition of his
 fortune.


 ""Why, what does anyone do with ten million dollars? Treasure it. Invest
 it. Spend it.""


 ""I mean, what will you do with it if you are going in place of my—""
 Arkalion bit his tongue.


 ""Your son, were you saying, Mr. Arkalion? Alaric Arkalion the Third.
 Did you know that I was able to boil my list of men down to thirty when
 I studied their family ties?""


 ""Brilliant, Mr. Smith. Alaric is so young—""


 ""Aren't they all? Twenty-one to twenty-six. Who was it who once said
 something about the flower of our young manhood?""


 ""Shakespeare?"" said Mr. Arkalion realizing that most quotes of lasting
 importance came from the bard.


 ""Sophocles,"" said Smith. ""But no matter. I will take young Alaric's
 place for ten million dollars.""


 Motives always troubled Mr. Arkalion, and thus he pursued what might
 have been a dangerous conversation. ""You'll never get a chance to spend
 it on the Nowhere Journey.""


 ""Let me worry about that.""


 ""No one ever returns.""


 ""My worry, not yours.""


 ""It is forever—as if you dropped out of existence. Alaric is so young.""


 ""I have always gambled, Mr. Arkalion. If I do not return in five
 years, you are to put the money in a trust fund for certain designated
 individuals, said fund to be terminated the moment I return. If I come
 back within the five years, you are merely to give the money over to
 me. Is that clear?""


 ""Yes.""


 ""I'll want it in writing, of course.""


 ""Of course. A plastic surgeon is due here in about ten minutes, Mr.
 Smith, and we can get on with.... But if I don't know your name, how
 can I put it in writing?""


 Smith smiled. ""I changed my name to Smith for the occasion. Perfectly
 legal. My name is John X. Smith—now!""


 ""That's where you're wrong,"" said Mr. Arkalion as the plastic surgeon
 entered. ""Your name is Alaric Arkalion III—
now
.""


 The plastic surgeon skittered around Smith, examining him minutely with
 the casual expertness that comes with experience.


 ""Have to shorten the cheek bones.""


 ""For ten million dollars,"" said Smith, ""you can take the damned things
 out altogether and hang them on your wall.""
Sophia Androvna Petrovitch made her way downtown through the bustle of
 tired workers and the occasional sprinkling of Comrades. She crushed
 her
ersatz
cigarette underfoot at number 616 Stalin Avenue, paused
 for the space of five heartbeats at the door, went inside.


 ""What do you want?"" The man at the desk was myopic but bull-necked.


 Sophia showed her party card.


 ""Oh, Comrade. Still, you are a woman.""


 ""You're terribly observant, Comrade,"" said Sophia coldly. ""I am here to
 volunteer.""


 ""But a woman.""


 ""There is nothing in the law which says a woman cannot volunteer.""


 ""We don't make women volunteer.""


 ""I mean really volunteer, of her own free will.""


 ""Her—own—free will?"" The bull-necked man removed his spectacles,
 scratched his balding head with the ear-pieces. ""You mean volunteer
 without—""


 ""Without coercion. I want to volunteer. I am here to volunteer. I want
 to sign on for the next Stalintrek.""


 ""Stalintrek, a woman?""


 ""That is what I said.""


 ""We don't force women to volunteer."" The man scratched some more.


 ""Oh, really,"" said Sophia. ""This is 1992, not mid-century, Comrade. Did
 not Stalin say, 'Woman was created to share the glorious destiny of
 Mother Russia with her mate?'"" Sophia created the quote randomly.


 ""Yes, if Stalin said—""


 ""He did.""


 ""Still, I do not recall—""


 ""What?"" Sophia cried. ""Stalin dead these thirty-nine years and you
 don't recall his speeches? What is your name, Comrade?""


 ""Please, Comrade. Now that you remind me, I remember.""


 ""What is your name.""


 ""Here, I will give you the volunteer papers to sign. If you pass the
 exams, you will embark on the next Stalintrek, though why a beautiful
 young woman like you—""


 ""Shut your mouth and hand me those papers.""


 There, sitting behind that desk, was precisely why. Why should she,
 Sophia Androvna Petrovitch, wish to volunteer for the Stalintrek?
 Better to ask why a bird flies south in the winter, one day ahead of
 the first icy gale. Or why a lemming plunges recklessly into the sea
 with his multitudes of fellows, if, indeed, the venture were to turn
 out grimly.


 But there, behind that desk, was part of the reason. The Comrade. The
 bright sharp Comrade, with his depth of reasoning, his fountain of
 gushing emotions, his worldliness.
Pfooey!
It was as if she had been in a cocoon all her life, stifled, starved,
 the cottony inner lining choking her whenever she opened her mouth,
 the leathery outer covering restricting her when she tried to move.
 No one had ever returned from the Stalintrek. She then had to assume
 no one would. Including Sophia Androvna Petrovitch. But then, there
 was nothing she would miss, nothing to which she particularly wanted
 to return. Not the stark, foul streets of Stalingrad, not the workers
 with their vapid faces or the Comrades with their cautious, sweating,
 trembling, fearful non-decisions, not the higher echelon of Comrades,
 more frightened but showing it less, who would love the beauty of
 her breasts and loins but not herself for you never love anything
 but the Stalinimage and Mother Russia herself, not those terrified
 martinet-marionettes who would love the parts of her if she permitted
 but not her or any other person for that matter.


 Wrong with the Stalintrek was its name alone, a name one associated
 with everything else in Russia for an obvious, post-Stalin reason. But
 everything else about the Stalintrek shrieked mystery and adventure.
 Where did you go? How did you get there? What did you do? Why?


 A million questions which had kept her awake at night and, if
 she thought about them hard enough, satisfied her deep longing
 for something different. And then one day when stolid Mrs.
 Ivanovna-Rasnikov had said, ""It is a joke, a terrible, terrible joke
 they are taking my husband Fyodor on the Stalintrek when he lacks
 sufficient imagination to go from here to Leningrad or even Tula. Can
 you picture Fyodor on the Stalintrek? Better they should have taken me.
 Better they should have taken his wife."" That day Sophia could hardly
 contain herself.


 As a party member she had access to the law and she read it three times
 from start to finish (in her dingy flat by the light of a smoking,
 foul-smelling, soft-wax candle) but could find nothing barring women
 from the Stalintrek.


 Had Fyodor Rasnikov volunteered? Naturally. Everyone volunteered,
 although when your name was called you had no choice. There had been
 no draft in Russia since the days of the Second War of the People's
 Liberation. Volunteer? What, precisely, did the word mean?


 She, Sophia Androvna Petrovitch would volunteer, without being told.
 Thus it was she found herself at 616 Stalin Avenue, and thus the
 balding, myopic, bull-necked Comrade thrust the papers across his desk
 at her.


 She signed her name with such vehemence and ferocity that she almost
 tore through the paper.
CHAPTER II
Three-score men sit in the crowded, smoke-filled room. Some drink
 beer, some squat in moody silence, some talk in an animated fashion
 about nothing very urgent. At the one small door, two guards pace back
 and forth slowly, creating a gentle swaying of smoke-patterns in the
 hazy room. The guards, in simple military uniform, carry small, deadly
 looking weapons.
FIRST MAN: Fight City Hall? Are you kidding? They took you, bud. Don't
 try to fight it, I know. I know.


 SECOND MAN: I'm telling you, there was a mistake in the records.
 I'm over twenty-six. Two weeks and two days. Already I wrote to my
 Congressman. Hell, that's why I voted for him, he better go to bat for
 me.


 THIRD MAN: You think that's something? I wouldn't be here only those
 doctors are crazy. I mean, crazy. Me, with a cyst big as a golf ball on
 the base of my spine.


 FIRST MAN: You too. Don't try to fight it.


 FOURTH MAN: (Newly named Alaric Arkalion III) I look forward to this
 as a stimulating adventure. Does the fact that they select men for the
 Nowhere Journey once every seven hundred and eighty days strike anyone
 as significant?


 SECOND MAN: I got my own problems.


 ALARIC ARKALION: This is not a thalamic problem, young man. Not
 thalamic at all.


 THIRD MAN: Young man? Who are you kidding?


 ALARIC ARKALION: (Who realizes, thanks to the plastic surgeon, he is
 the youngest looking of all, with red cheeks and peachfuzz whiskers) It
 is a problem of the intellect. Why seven hundred and eighty days?


 FIRST MAN: I read the magazine, too, chief. You think we're all going
 to the planet Mars. How original.


 ALARIC ARKALION: As a matter of fact, that is exactly what I think.


 SECOND MAN: Mars?


 FIRST MAN: (Laughing) It's a long way from Mars to City Hall, doc.


 SECOND MAN: You mean, through space to Mars?


 ALARIC ARKALION: Exactly, exactly. Quite a coincidence, otherwise.


 FIRST MAN: You're telling me.


 ALARIC ARKALION: (Coldly) Would you care to explain it?


 FIRST MAN: Why, sure. You see, Mars is—uh, I don't want to steal your
 thunder, chief. Go ahead.


 ALARIC ARKALION: Once every seven hundred and eighty days Mars and the
 Earth find themselves in the same orbital position with respect to the
 sun. In other words, Mars and Earth are closest then. Were there such a
 thing as space travel, new, costly, not thoroughly tested, they would
 want to make each journey as brief as possible. Hence the seven hundred
 and eighty days.


 FIRST MAN: Not bad, chief. You got most of it.


 THIRD MAN: No one ever said anything about space travel.


 FIRST MAN: You think we'd broadcast it or something, stupid? It's part
 of a big, important scientific experiment, only we're the hamsters.


 ALARIC ARKALION: Ridiculous. You're forgetting all about the Cold War.


 FIRST MAN: He thinks we're fighting a war with the Martians. (Laughs)
 Orson Wells stuff, huh?


 ALARIC ARKALION: With the Russians. The Russians. We developed A bombs.
 They developed A bombs. We came up with the H bomb. So did they. We
 placed a station up in space, a fifth of the way to the moon. So did
 they. Then—nothing more about scientific developments. For over twenty
 years. I ask you, doesn't it seem peculiar?


 FIRST MAN: Peculiar, he says.


 ALARIC ARKALION: Peculiar.


 SECOND MAN: I wish my Congressman....


 FIRST MAN: You and your Congressman. The way you talk, it was your vote
 got him in office.


 SECOND MAN: If only I could get out and talk to him.


 ALARIC ARKALION: No one is permitted to leave.


 FIRST MAN: Punishable by a prison term, the law says.


 SECOND MAN: Oh yeah? Prison, shmision. Or else go on the Nowhere
 Journey. Well, I don't see the difference.


 FIRST MAN: So, go ahead. Try to escape.


 SECOND MAN: (Looking at the guards) They got them all over. All over. I
 think our mail is censored.


 ALARIC ARKALION: It is.


 SECOND MAN: They better watch out. I'm losing my temper. I get violent
 when I lose my temper.


 FIRST MAN: See? See how the guards are trembling.


 SECOND MAN: Very funny. Maybe you didn't have a good job or something?
 Maybe you don't care. I care. I had a job with a future. Didn't pay
 much, but a real blue chip future. So they send me to Nowhere.


 FIRST MAN: You're not there yet.


 SECOND MAN: Yeah, but I'm going.


 THIRD MAN: If only they let you know when. My back is killing me. I'm
 waiting to pull a sick act. Just waiting, that's all.


 FIRST MAN: Go ahead and wait, a lot of good it will do you.


 THIRD MAN: You mind your own business.


 FIRST MAN: I am, doc. You brought the whole thing up.


 SECOND MAN: He's looking for trouble.


 THIRD MAN: He'll get it.


 ALARIC ARKALION: We're going to be together a long time. A long time.
 Why don't you all relax?


 SECOND MAN: You mind your own business.


 FIRST MAN: Nuts, aren't they. They're nuts. A sick act, yet.


 SECOND MAN: Look how it doesn't bother him. A failure, he was. I can
 just see it. What does he care if he goes away forever and doesn't come
 back? One bread line is as good as another.


 FIRST MAN: Ha-ha.


 SECOND MAN: Yeah, well I mean it. Forever. We're going away,
 someplace—forever. We're not coming back, ever. No one comes back.
 It's for good, for keeps.


 FIRST MAN: Tell it to your congressman. Or maybe you want to pull a
 sick act, too?


 THIRD MAN: (Hits First Man, who, surprised, crashes back against a
 table and falls down) It isn't an act, damn you!


 GUARD: All right, break it up. Come on, break it up....


 ALARIC ARKALION: (To himself) I wish I saw that ten million dollars
 already—
if
I ever get to see it.
They drove for hours through the fresh country air, feeling the wind
 against their faces, listening to the roar their ground-jet made, all
 alone on the rimrock highway.


 ""Where are we going, Kit?""


 ""Search me. Just driving.""


 ""I'm glad they let you come out this once. I don't know what they would
 have done to me if they didn't. I had to see you this once. I—""


 Temple smiled. He had absented himself without leave. It had been
 difficult enough and he might yet be in a lot of hot water, but it
 would be senseless to worry Stephanie. ""It's just for a few hours,"" he
 said.


 ""Hours. When we want a whole lifetime. Kit. Oh, Kit—why don't we run
 away? Just the two of us, someplace where they'll never find you. I
 could be packed and ready and—""


 ""Don't talk like that. We can't.""


 ""You want to go where they're sending you. You want to go.""


 ""For God's sake, how can you talk like that? I don't want to go
 anyplace, except with you. But we can't run away, Steffy. I've got to
 face it, whatever it is.""


 ""No you don't. It's noble to be patriotic, sure. It always was. But
 this is different, Kit. They don't ask for part of your life. Not for
 two years, or three, or a gamble because maybe you won't ever come
 back. They ask for all of you, for the rest of your life, forever, and
 they don't even tell you why. Kit, don't go! We'll hide someplace and
 get married and—""


 ""And nothing."" Temple stopped the ground-jet, climbed out, opened the
 door for Stephanie. ""Don't you see? There's no place to hide. Wherever
 you go, they'd look. You wouldn't want to spend the rest of your life
 running, Steffy. Not with me or anyone else.""


 ""I would. I would!""


 ""Know what would happen after a few years? We'd hate each other. You'd
 look at me and say 'I wouldn't be hiding like this, except for you. I'm
 young and—'""


 ""Kit, that's cruel! I would not.""


 ""Yes, you would. Steffy, I—"" A lump rose in his throat. He'd tell her
 goodbye, permanently. He had to do it that way, did not want her to
 wait endlessly and hopelessly for a return that would not materialize.
 ""I didn't get permission to leave, Steffy."" He hadn't meant to tell her
 that, but suddenly it seemed an easy way to break into goodbye.


 ""What do you mean? No—you didn't....""


 ""I had to see you. What can they do, send me for longer than forever?""


 ""Then you do want to run away with me!""


 ""Steffy, no. When I leave you tonight, Steffy, it's for good. That's
 it. The last of Kit Temple. Stop thinking about me. I don't exist.
 I—never was."" It sounded ridiculous, even to him.


 ""Kit, I love you. I love you. How can I forget you?""


 ""It's happened before. It will happen again."" That hurt, too. He was
 talking about a couple of statistics, not about himself and Stephanie.


 ""We're different, Kit. I'll love you forever. And—Kit ... I know
 you'll come back to me. I'll wait, Kit. We're different. You'll come
 back.""


 ""How many people do you think said
that
before?""


 ""You don't want to come back, even if you could. You're not thinking of
 us at all. You're thinking of your brother.""


 ""You know that isn't true. Sometimes I wonder about Jase, sure. But if
 I thought there was a chance to return—I'm a selfish cuss, Steffy. If
 I thought there was a chance, you know I'd want you all for myself. I'd
 brand you, and that's the truth.""


 ""You do love me!""


 ""I loved you, Steffy. Kit Temple loved you.""


 ""Loved?""


 ""Loved. Past tense. When I leave tonight, it's as if I don't exist
 anymore. As if I never existed. It's got to be that way, Steffy. In
 thirty years, no one ever returned.""


 ""Including your brother, Jase. So now you want to find him. What do I
 count for? What....""


 ""This going wasn't my idea. I wanted to stay with you. I wanted to
 marry you. I can't now. None of it. Forget me, Steffy. Forget you ever
 knew me. Jase said that to our folks before he was taken."" Almost five
 years before Jason Temple had been selected for the Nowhere Journey.
 He'd been young, though older than his brother Kit. Young, unattached,
 almost cheerful he was. Naturally, they never saw him again.


 ""Hold me, Kit. I'm sorry ... carrying on like this.""


 They had walked some distance from the ground-jet, through scrub
 oak and bramble bushes. They found a clearing, fragrant-scented,
 soft-floored still from last autumn, melodic with the chirping of
 nameless birds. They sat, not talking. Stephanie wore a gay summer
 dress, full-skirted, cut deep beneath the throat. She swayed toward him
 from the waist, nestled her head on his shoulder. He could smell the
 soft, sweet fragrance of her hair, of the skin at the nape of her neck.
 ""If you want to say goodbye ..."" she said.


 ""Stop it,"" he told her.


 ""If you want to say goodbye....""


 Her head rolled against his chest. She turned, cradled herself in his
 arms, smiled up at him, squirmed some more and had her head pillowed on
 his lap. She smiled tremulously, misty-eyed. Her lips parted.


 He bent and kissed her, knowing it was all wrong. This was not goodbye,
 not the way he wanted it. Quickly, definitely, for once and all. With
 a tear, perhaps, a lot of tears. But permanent goodbye. This was all
 wrong. The whole idea was to be business-like, objective. It had to
 be done that way, or no way at all. Briefly, he regretted leaving the
 encampment.


 This wasn't goodbye the way he wanted it. The way it had to be. This
 was
auf weidersen
.


 And then he forgot everything but Stephanie....
""I am Alaric Arkalion III,"" said the extremely young-looking man with
 the old, wise eyes.


 How incongruous, Temple thought. The eyes look almost middle-aged. The
 rest of him—a boy.


 ""Something tells me we'll be seeing a lot of each other,"" Arkalion
 went on. The voice was that of an older man, too, belying the youthful
 complexion, the almost childish features, the soft fuzz of a beard.


 ""I'm Kit Temple,"" said Temple, extending his hand. ""Arkalion, a strange
 name. I know it from somewhere.... Say! Aren't you—don't you have
 something to do with carpets or something?""


 ""Here and now, no. I am a number. A-92-6417. But my father is—perhaps
 I had better say was—my father is Alaric Arkalion II. Yes, that is
 right, the carpet king.""


 ""I'll be darned,"" said Temple.


 ""Why?""


 ""Well,"" Temple laughed. ""I never met a billionaire before.""


 ""Here I am not a billionaire, nor will I ever be one again. A-92-6417,
 a number. On his way to Mars with a bunch of other numbers.""


 ""Mars? You sound sure of yourself.""


 ""Reasonably. Ah, it is a pleasure to talk with a gentleman. I am
 reasonably certain it will be Mars.""


 Temple nodded in agreement. ""That's what the Sunday supplements say,
 all right.""


 ""And doubtless you have observed no one denies it.""


 ""But what on Earth do we want on Mars?""


 ""That in itself is a contradiction,"" laughed Arkalion. ""We'll find out,
 though, Temple.""


 They had reached the head of the line, found themselves entering a
 huge, double-decker jet-transport. They found two seats together,
 followed the instructions printed at the head of the aisle by strapping
 themselves in and not smoking. Talking all around them was subdued.


 ""Contrariness has given way to fear,"" Arkalion observed. ""You should
 have seen them the last few days, waiting around the induction center,
 a two-ton chip on each shoulder. Say, where
were
you?""


 ""I—what do you mean?""


 ""I didn't see you until last evening. Suddenly, you were here.""


 ""Did anyone else miss me?""


 ""But I remember you the first day.""


 ""Did anyone else miss me? Any of the officials?""


 ""No. Not that I know of.""


 ""Then I was here,"" Temple said, very seriously.


 Arkalion smiled. ""By George, of course. Then you were here. Temple,
 we'll get along fine.""


 Temple said that was swell.


 ""Anyway, we'd better. Forever is a long time.""

 What It Means to Be a Libertarian: A Personal Interpretation  
 By Charles Murray  
 Broadway Books; 192 pages; $20 

 Libertarianism: A Primer 
 By David Boaz 
 The Free Press; 336 pages; $23 
 
          Are libertarians on a roll? If you begin with the recent election to Congress of Ron Paul, a former Libertarian presidential candidate; note the emergence of cyberlibertarians as a political constituency; factor in the collapse of communism; and quote Bill Clinton's admission that ""the era of big government is over,"" you have what sounds like a compelling case. There are other signs as well: the rise of the Cato Institute as one of the leading Washington think tanks; and the general accrual of credibility to what, 20 years ago, was a fringe-y movement of Ayn Rand devotees and risquÃ© Republicans. 

         Yet, there is an equally strong argument to be made that the United States is only moving toward libertarian-style minimalist government in the same way that you get closer to Paris when you drive east to the supermarket. Libertarian presidential candidate Harry Browne got less than 500,000 votes in 1996. This was an increase over 1992 but only a slight improvement upon the Libertarian vote in 1988, and a far weaker performance than in 1980. Meanwhile, leaders of the Christian right, whose aims are antithetical to those of libertarians, make the plausible claim that it is they who are winning converts and influence by the day. And if Clinton now knows to eschew ""big government,"" members of the Republican Congress elected in 1994 have also learned their lesson about attempting to make government truly smaller. 

         The appearance of these two books counts as an entry in the plus side of the ledger. Each attempts to make libertarianism more respectable and popular. They are pitched, however, at different audiences. Charles Murray is a conservative trying to persuade other conservatives that the absence of restraint will in fact make people more moral. He rather reluctantly defends the legalization of drugs, prostitution, and pornography, and concedes that government has to play some more-than-minimal role. David Boaz, an official at the Cato Institute, sees libertarianism as neither conservative nor liberal, and aims to convert everyone. But while he is more ecumenical, Boaz is far more extreme. If you insist on keeping national parks or old-age pensions, he has some advice on the least bad way to run these things--but, given his druthers, he wouldn't run them at all. 

          Murray's more laconic account is based upon a classical liberal argument: Force is bad; cooperation is good; government is force; ergo, the only legitimate functions of government are to enforce voluntary agreements, and to prevent force and fraud. Murray accepts, though, that there also exist limited ""public goods."" The two he names are environmental protection and education. These exceptions to the rule of the minimal state are probably necessary to make libertarianism palatable to mainstream conservatives. The problem is that they require an admission--which Murray never makes directly--that decisions made by a democratic government within the boundaries of a constitution are not merely ""force"" but also ""cooperation,"" albeit with a certain degree of legitimate coercion. 

         In an attempt to distinguish those public purposes that are tolerable from those that aren't, Murray posits that, to be valid, public goods either have to be ""nonexclusive""--interventions from which everyone benefits--or else must arise to counter ""externalities,"" costs passed on to others that, in practical terms, cannot be compensated, as in the case of the chemical incinerator that pollutes the air. What this scheme leaves unclear is why education and the environment are valid public goods while other efforts he opposes--insuring elderly people against poverty, say, or providing national health insurance--are not. Education and the environment are not purely nonexclusive goods. Some people who either don't have children or who don't like to visit national parks--or both--will be taxed to pay for them. And if the standard of nonexclusivity is not absolute, then programs Murray rejects, such as welfare and Medicare, can reasonably qualify. Anyone may fall upon hard times, and most people anticipate being around long enough to benefit from nationalized health care for the elderly. 

         Murray's next strategy is to try a series of more pragmatic arguments against government action. To show how little sense regulations make, he proposes a thought experiment. Why not give consumers a choice, he asks, about whether to use regulated or unregulated products (unregulated products, he stipulates, would have to be labeled as such). This merely demonstrates that Murray has failed to understand his own argument about externalities as a basis for public goods. The point of regulation is not merely to protect consumers, but to protect innocent third parties. Of course consumers would be better off if the government gave them the right to buy appliances built by polluting factories and low-cost child labor. (In fact, consumers already can, so long as the pollution and child labor are foreign and not domestic.) These regulations exist for the benefit of those who live downstream from the factory and the children who would otherwise be working inside it. 

         Or, to take an example of regulation employed by Murray, consider the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit. Murray says there is no reason to keep people from harming themselves. But speed limits don't just prevent people who willingly take the risk of driving faster and more dangerously from hurting themselves. They improve the odds for the children in the back seat, and for the safe driver in the opposite lane, whom the reckless driver might plow into. With this example, Murray undercuts himself in another way. He says regulation only gets more onerous over time. But the national speed limit is an example of precisely the opposite point. In most states you can now drive 65 or 70 on freeways. Like many conservatives, Murray high-dudgeons himself into the Jeane Kirkpatrick position of ascribing historical inevitability to a trend that is actually in the midst of reversal. 

          Murray involves himself in more serious contradictions by drawing in arguments from his earlier books, each of which presents a different case against public action to fight poverty. In Losing Ground (1984), the work that made him famous, he contended that government anti-poverty programs had done much to create the underclass. In The Bell Curve (1994), he said that some people--namely blacks--were genetically inferior, a condition that government could do nothing about. In What It Means to Be a Libertarian , he says government intervention is morally wrong. 

         He means these arguments to be mutually reinforcing: Government social programs don't work; they can't work on account of human nature; and if by chance they do work, they're morally unjustified anyhow. But this triple argument in the triple alternative actually obliterates itself. In The Bell Curve , Murray contends that government can't really help people. In the version of that argument given in What It Means , he asserts that ""most government interventions are ineffectual"" because ""modern society has the inertia of a ponderous freight train."" But if government can't reroute the freight train in a better direction, it's hard to see how it can derail it. The metaphor undermines the Losing Ground Murray, the guy who writes that ""[u]ntil the government began masking the social costs created by large numbers of fatherless children, civilized communities everywhere stigmatized illegitimacy."" The ""futility"" thesis--government can't help--and the ""perversity"" thesis--government makes problems worse instead of better--are at odds. If government can't do anything, how can it do so strongly the opposite of what it intends? 

         Dimly aware of this problem, Murray brings in a more sweeping illegitimacy thesis--government is unjustified--to trump all the others. But this exposes his underlying bias, which casts doubt on the critiques of government in both Losing Ground and The Bell Curve . The three Murrays play a kind of fugue throughout this book. In fact, there seems to be a fourth Murray struggling to get out. This is the Charles Murray who says late in the book that he half-supports the idea of a negative income tax--a guaranteed income for everyone. This would seem to violate all the aforementioned principles. It would create a powerful incentive (of the kind attacked in Losing Ground ) for people not to work; it would be an attempt to help people who The Bell Curve says can't be helped anyway; and it would certainly violate What It Means to Be a Libertarian 's admonition against forcing people to pay for dubious public goods. What Murray likes about the idea is that it would finally discharge society's obligation to members of the underclass. They might not be better off, but they would have to quit bellyaching. Combined with a new, heartfelt attack on civil-rights laws (Murray says bad, prejudicial discrimination is inseparable from good, economically sensible discrimination), this passage leaves one with the sense that in declaring himself a libertarian, Murray has not yet removed the final veil. 

         David Boaz has written a more stimulating, more consistent, and more dogmatic book. After a long history of libertarian ideas, he proposes a version of Murray's basic argument, which he calls the ""nonagression axiom""--no one can use force against anyone else. That's it. Unlike Murray, Boaz draws no exception for public goods. He does not pander to political reality by accepting large expenditures for national defense, environmental regulation, or publicly funded education. He does not believe in national parks (""private stewards"" will exercise ""proper stewardship""). Nor does he believe in military conscription in wartime (""[t]he libertarian believes that people will voluntarily defend a country worth defending""). 

         Though this version of libertarianism seems to flirt with anarchism, Boaz isn't worried about disarray. In the absence of malign government intervention, there will emerge what he calls ""spontaneous order."" Boaz's model for this is the Internet. He neglects, of course, the fact that the Internet began life as a federal defense project. But the real question Boaz begs is why the laws he thinks are necessary for society to function, including fair chunks of the U.S. Constitution, count as ""spontaneous"" and good while everything else is defined as coercion. Capitalism may arise spontaneously, but the Bill of Rights is as much a man-made construct as the food-stamp program. 

          In the end, it is futile to argue with this view. Boaz has worked out every possible detail of his libertarian heaven in an utterly comprehensive and slightly mad way. He takes pains to say he is not offering a plan for a perfect society, merely a ""framework for utopia"" (the phrase is Robert Nozick's). But his heart is clearly with the ancient Chinese philosopher Lao-tzu, who wrote: ""Without law or compulsion, men would dwell in harmony."" 

         Murray, too, is afflicted with millenarianism. ""That America is not the land of universal plenty it should have become is for many libertarians, including me, the source of our deepest anger about what big government has done to this country,"" he writes at one point. He offers instead ""a society that is prosperous and virtuous, but one that is exciting and fun as well."" I was reminded of the famous passage where Marx writes that in the Communist future, every worker will spend part of his day fishing, part writing poetry, and only part working at his lathe. Marx believed that the state would wither away. Libertarians believe men must wither it. But really, their utopias are not so different. They share a wishful vision of human perfectibility dressed up as an idea of justice.

Obviously, no conqueror wants his subjects to

 revolt against his rule. Obviously? This one

 would go to any lengths to start a rebellion!
I


 The biotechnicians had been very thorough. I was already a little
 undersized, which meant that my height and build were suitable—I
 could pass for a big Earthling. And of course my face and hands and so
 on were all right, the Earthlings being a remarkably humanoid race.
 But the technicians had had to remodel my ears, blunting the tips and
 grafting on lobes and cutting the muscles that move them. My crest had
 to go and a scalp covered with revolting hair was now on the top of my
 skull.


 Finally, and most difficult, there had been the matter of skin color.
 It just wasn't possible to eliminate my natural coppery pigmentation.
 So they had injected a substance akin to melanin, together with a virus
 which would manufacture it in my body, the result being a leathery
 brown. I could pass for a member of the so-called ""white"" subspecies,
 one who had spent most of his life in the open.


 The mimicry was perfect. I hardly recognized the creature that looked
 out of the mirror. My lean, square, blunt-nosed face, gray eyes,
 and big hands were the same or nearly so. But my black crest had
 been replaced with a shock of blond hair, my ears were small and
 immobile, my skin a dull bronze, and several of Earth's languages were
 hypnotically implanted in my brain—together with a set of habits and
 reflexes making up a pseudo-personality which should be immune to any
 tests that the rebels could think of.


 I
was
Earthling! And the disguise was self-perpetuating: the hair
 grew and the skin color was kept permanent by the artificial ""disease.""
 The biotechnicians had told me that if I kept the disguise long enough,
 till I began to age—say, in a century or so—the hair would actually
 thin and turn white as it did with the natives.


 It was reassuring to think that once my job was over, I could be
 restored to normal. It would need another series of operations and as
 much time as the original transformation, but it would be as complete
 and scarless. I'd be human again.


 I put on the clothes they had furnished me, typical Earthly
 garments—rough trousers and shirt of bleached plant fibers, jacket and
 heavy shoes of animal skin, a battered old hat of matted fur known as
 felt. There were objects in my pockets, the usual money and papers, a
 claspknife, the pipe and tobacco I had trained myself to smoke and even
 to like. It all fitted into my character of a wandering, outdoors sort
 of man, an educated atavist.


 I went out of the hospital with the long swinging stride of one
 accustomed to walking great distances.
The Center was busy around me. Behind me, the hospital and laboratories
 occupied a fairly small building, some eighty stories of stone and
 steel and plastic. On either side loomed the great warehouses, military
 barracks, officers' apartments, civilian concessions, filled with the
 vigorous life of the starways. Behind the monstrous wall, a mile to my
 right, was the spaceport, and I knew that a troopship had just lately
 dropped gravs from Valgolia herself.


 The Center swarmed with young recruits off duty, gaping at the sights,
 swaggering in their new uniforms. Their skins shone like polished
 copper in the blistering sunlight, and their crests were beginning to
 wilt a little. All Earth is not the tropical jungle most Valgolians
 think it is—northern Europe is very pleasant, and Greenland is even a
 little on the cold side—but it gets hot enough at North America Center
 in midsummer to fry a shilast.


 A cosmopolitan throng filled the walkways. Soldiers predominated—huge,
 shy Dacors, little slant-eyed Yangtusans, brawling Gorrads, all the
 manhood of Valgolia. Then there were other races, blue-skinned Vegans,
 furry Proximans, completely non-humanoid Sirians and Antarians.
 They were here as traders, observers, tourists, whatever else of a
 non-military nature one can imagine.


 I made an absent-minded way through the crowds. A sudden crack on the
 side of my head, nearly bowling me over, brought me to awareness. I
 looked up into the arrogant face of one of the new recruits and heard
 him rasp, ""Watch where you're going, Terrie!""
The young blood in the Valgolian military is deliberately trained
 to harshness, even brutality, for our militarism must impress such
 backward colonies as Earth. It goes against our grain, but it is
 necessary. At another time this might have annoyed me. I could have
 pulled rank on him. Not only was I an officer, but such treatment must
 be used with intellectual deliberation. The occasional young garrison
 trooper who comes here with the idea that the natives are an inferior
 breed to be kicked around misses the whole point of Empire. If, indeed,
 Earth's millions were an inferior breed, I wouldn't have been here at
 all. Valgol needs an economic empire, but if all we had in mind was
 serfdom we'd be perfectly content with the plodding animal life of
 Deneb VII or a hundred other worlds.


 I cringed appropriately, as if I didn't understand Valgolian Universal,
 and slunk past him. But it griped me to be taken for a Terrie. If I was
 to become an Earthling, I would at least be a self-respecting one.
There were plenty of Terries—Terrestrials—around, of course, moving
 with their odd combination of slavish deference toward Valgolians and
 arrogant superiority toward mere Earthlings. They have adopted the
 habits and customs of civilization, entered the Imperial service, speak
 Valgolian even with their families. Many of them shave their heads save
 for a scalp lock, in imitation of the crest, and wear white robes
 suggesting those of civil functionaries at home.


 I've always felt a little sorry for the class. They work, and study,
 and toady to us, and try so hard to be like us. It's frustrating,
 because that's exactly what we don't want. Valgolians are Valgolians
 and Earthlings are men of Earth. Well, Terries are important to the
 ultimate aims of the Empire, but not in the way they think they are.
 They serve as another symbol of Valgolian conquest for Earth to hate.


 I entered the Administration Building. They expected me there and took
 me at once to the office of General Vorka, who's a general only as
 far as this solar system is concerned. Had there been any Earthlings
 around, I would have saluted to conform to the show of militarism, but
 General Vorka sat alone behind his desk, and I merely said, ""Hello,
 Coordinator.""


 The sleeves of his tunic rolled up, the heat of North America beading
 his forehead with sweat, the big man looked up at me. ""Ah, yes. I'm
 glad you're finally prepared. The sooner we get this thing started—""
 He extended a silver galla-dust box. ""Sniff? Have a seat, Conru.""


 I inhaled gratefully and relaxed. The Coordinator picked up a sheaf of
 papers on his desk and leafed through them. ""Umm-mm, only fifty-two
 years old and a captain already. Remarkably able, a young man
 like you. And your work hitherto has been outstanding. That Vegan
 business....""


 I said yes, I knew, but could he please get down to business. You
 couldn't blame me for being a bit anxious to begin. Disguised as I was
 as an Earthman, I felt uncomfortable, embarrassed, almost, at being
 with my ex-countrymen.


 The Coordinator shrugged. ""Well, if you can carry this business
 off—fine. If you fail, you may die quite unpleasantly. That's their
 trouble, Conru: you wouldn't be regarded as an individual, but as a
 Valgolian. Did you know that they even make such distinctions among
 themselves? I mean races and sub-races and social castes and the like;
 it's keeping them divided and impotent, Conru. It's also keeping them
 out of the Empire. A shame.""
I knew all that, of course, but I merely nodded. Coordinator Vorka was
 a wonderful man in his field, and if he tended to be on the garrulous
 side, what could I do? I said, ""I know that, sir. I also know I was
 picked for a dangerous job because you thought I could fill the role.
 But I still don't know exactly what the job is.""


 Coordinator Vorka smiled. ""I'm afraid I can't tell you much more
 than you must already have guessed,"" he said. ""The anarch movement
 here—the rebels, that is—is getting no place, primarily because of
 internal difficulties. When members of the same group spit epithets
 at each other referring to what they consider racial or national
 distinctions which determine superiority or inferiority, the group is
 bound to be an insecure one. Such insecurity just does not make for a
 strong rebellion, Conru. They try, and we goad them—but dissention
 splits them constantly and their revolutions fizzle out.


 ""They just can't unite against us, can't unite at all. Conru, you know
 how we've tried to educate them. It's worked, too, to some extent.
 But you can't educate three billion people who have a whole cultural
 pattern behind them.""


 I winced. ""Three billion?""


 ""Certainly. Earth is a rich planet, Conru, and a fairly crowded one at
 the same time. Bickering is inevitable. It's a part of their culture,
 as much as cooperation has been a part of ours.""


 I nodded. ""We learned the hard way. The old Valgol was a poor planet
 and we had to unite to conquer space or we could not have survived.""


 The Coordinator sniffed again at his silver box. ""Of course. And we're
 trying to help these people unite. They don't have to make the same
 mistakes we did, long ago. They don't have to at all. Get them to hate
 us enough, get them to hate us until all their own clannish hatreds
 don't count at all.... Well, you know what happened on Samtrak.""


 I knew. The Samtraks are now the entrepreneurs of the Empire, really
 ingenious traders, but within the memory of some of our older men they
 were a sore-spot. They didn't understand the meaning of Empire any more
 than Earth does, and they never did understand it until we goaded them
 into open rebellion. The very reverse of divide and rule, you might
 say, and it worked. We withdrew trading privileges one by one, until
 they revolted successfully, thus educating themselves sociologically in
 only a few generations.
Vorka said, ""The problem of Earth is not quite that simple."" He leaned
 back, made a bridge of his fingers, and peered across them at me. ""Do
 you know precisely what a provocateur job is, Conru?""


 I said that I did, but only in a hazy way, because until now my work
 had been pretty much restricted to social relations on the more
 advanced Empire planets. However, I told him that I did know the idea
 was to provoke discontent and, ultimately, rebellion.


 The Coordinator smiled. ""Well, that's just the starter, Conru. It's a
 lot more complex than that. Each planet has its own special problems.
 The Samtraks, for example, had a whole background of cutthroat
 competition. That was easy: we eliminated that by showing them what
real
cutthroat competition could be like. But Earth is different.
 Look at it this way. They fight among themselves. Because of their
 mythical distinctions, not realizing that there are no inferior races,
 only more or less advanced ones, and that individuals must be judged as
 individuals, not as members of groups, nations or races. A planet like
 Earth can be immensely valuable to the Empire, but not if it has to be
 garrisoned. Its contribution must be voluntary and whole-hearted.""


 ""A difficult problem,"" I said. ""My opinion is that we should treat all
 exactly alike—
force
them to abandon their unrealistic differences.""


 ""Exactly!"" The Coordinator seemed pleased, but, actually, this was
 pretty elementary stuff. ""We're never too rough on the eager lads
 who come here from Valgol and kick the natives around a bit. We even
 encourage it when the spirit of rebelliousness dies down.""


 I told him I had met one.


 ""Irritating, wasn't it, Conru? Humiliating. Of course, these lads
 will be reconditioned to civilization when they finish their military
 service and prepare for more specialized work. Yes, treating all
 Earthlings alike is the solution. We put restrictions on these
 colonials; they can't hold top jobs, and so on. And we encourage wild
 stories about brutality on our part. Not enough to make everybody mad
 at us, or even a majority—the rumored tyranny has always happened to
 someone else. But there's a certain class of beings who'll get fighting
 mad, and that's the class we want.""


 ""The leaders,"" I chimed in. ""The idealists. Brave, intelligent,
 patriotic. The kind who probably wouldn't be a part of this racial
 bickering, anyway.""


 ""Right,"" said the Coordinator. ""We'll give them the ammunition for
 their propaganda. We've
been
doing it. Result: the leaders get mad.
 Races, religions, nationalities, they hate us worse than they hate each
 other.""
The way he painted it, I was hardly needed at all. I told him that.


 ""Ideally, that would be the situation, Conru. Only it doesn't work
 that way."" He took out a soft cloth and wiped his forehead. ""Even the
 leaders are too involved in this myth of differences and they can't
 concentrate all their efforts. Luron, of course, would be the other
 alternative—""


 That was a very logical statement, but sometimes logic has a way of
 making you laugh, and I was laughing now. Luron considered itself our
 arch-enemy. With a few dozen allies on a path of conquest, Luron
 thought it could wrest Empire from our hands. Well, we let them play.
 And each time Luron swooped down on one of the more primitive planets,
 we let them, for Luron would serve as well as ourselves in goading
 backward peoples to unite and advance. Perhaps Luron, as a social
 entity, grew wiser each time. Certainly the primitive colonials did.
 Luron had started a chain reaction which threatened to overthrow the
 tyranny of superstition on a hundred planets. Good old Luron, our
 arch-enemy, would see the light itself some day.


 The Coordinator shook his head. ""Can't use Luron here. Technologies are
 entirely too similar. It might shatter both planets, and we wouldn't
 want that.""


 ""So what do we use?""


 ""You, Conru. You get in with the revolutionaries, you make sure that
 they want to fight, you—""


 ""I see,"" I told him. ""Then I try to stop it at the last minute. Not so
 soon that the rebellion doesn't help at all—""


 The Coordinator put his hand down flat. ""Nothing of the sort. They
must
fight. And they must be defeated, again and again, if necessary,
 until they are ready to succeed. That will be, of course, when they are
totally
against us.""


 I stood up. ""I understand.""


 He waved me back into the chair. ""You'll be lucky to understand it
 by the time you're finished with this assignment and transferred to
 another ... that is, if you come out of this one alive.""


 I smiled a bit sheepishly and told him to go ahead.


 ""We have some influence in the underground movement, as you might
 logically expect. The leader is a man we worked very hard to have
 elected.""


 ""A member of one of the despised races?"" I guessed.


 ""The best we could do at this point was to help elect someone from a
 minority sub-group of the dominant white race. The leader's name is
 Levinsohn. He is of the white sub-group known as Jews.""
""How well is this Levinsohn accepted by the movement?""


 ""Considerable resistance and hostility,"" the Coordinator said. ""That's
 to be expected. However, we've made sure that there is no other
 organization the minority-haters can join, so they have to follow
 him or quit. He's able, all right; one of the most able men they
 have, which helps our aims. Even those who discriminate against Jews
 reluctantly admire him. He's moved the headquarters of the movement
 out into space, and the man's so brilliant that we don't even know
 where. We'll find out, mainly through you, I hope, but that isn't the
 important thing.""


 ""What is?"" I asked, baffled.


 ""To report on the unification of Earth. It's possible that the anarch
 movement can achieve it under Levinsohn. In that case, we'll make sure
 they win, or think they win, and will gladly sign a treaty giving Earth
 equal planetary status in the Empire.""


 ""And if unity hasn't been achieved?""


 ""We simply crush this rebellion and make them start all over again.
 They'll have learned some degree of unity from this revolt and so the
 next one will be more successful."" He stood up and I got out of my
 chair to face him. ""That's for the future, though. We'll work out our
 plans from the results of this campaign.""


 ""But isn't there a lot of danger in the policy of fomenting rebellion
 against us?"" I asked.


 He lifted his shoulders. ""Evolution is always painful, forced evolution
 even more so. Yes, there are great dangers, but advance information
 from you and other agents can reduce the risk. It's a chance we must
 take, Conru.""


 ""Conrad,"" I corrected him, smiling. ""Plain Mr. Conrad Haugen ... of
 Earth.""
II


 A few days later, I left North America Center, and in spite of the
 ominous need to hurry, my eastward journey was a ramble. The anarchs
 would be sure to check my movements as far back as they could, and my
 story had better ring true. For the present, I must
be
my role, a
 vagabond.


 The city was soon behind me. It was far from other settlement—it is
 good policy to keep the Centers rather isolated, and we could always
 contact our garrisons in native towns quickly enough. Before long I was
 alone in the mountains.


 I liked that part of the trip. The Rockies are huge and serene, a fresh
 cold wind blows from their peaks and roars in the pines, brawling
 rivers foam through their dales and canyons—it is a big landscape,
 clean and strong and lonely. It speaks with silence.


 I hitched a ride for some hundreds of miles with one of the great
 truck-trains that dominate the western highways. The driver was
 Earthling, and though he complained much about the Valgolian tyranny he
 looked well-fed, healthy, secure. I thought of the wars which had been
 laying the planet waste, the social ruin and economic collapse which
 the Empire had mended, and wondered if Terra would ever be fit to rule
 itself.


 I came out of the enormous mountainlands into the sage plains of
 Nevada. For a few days I worked at a native ranch, listening to the
 talk and keeping my mouth shut. Yes, there was discontent!


 ""Their taxes are killing me,"" said the owner. ""What the hell incentive
 do I have to produce if they take it away from me?"" I nodded, but
 thought:
Your kind was paying more taxes in the old days, and had
 less to show for it. Here you get your money back in public works and
 universal security. No one on Earth is cold or hungry. Can you only
 produce for your own private gain, Earthling?
""The labor draft got my kid the other day,"" said the foreman. ""He'll
 spend two good years of his life working for them, and prob'ly come
 back hopheaded about the good o' the Empire.""
There was a time
, I thought,
when millions of Earthlings clamored
 for work, or spent years fighting their wars, gave their youth to a
 god of battle who only clamored for more blood. And how can we have a
 stable society without educating its members to respect it?
""I
want
another kid,"" said the female cook. ""Two ain't really enough.
 They're good boys, but I want a girl too. Only the Eridanian law says
 if I go over my quota, if I have one more, they'll sterilize me! And
 they'd do it, the meddling devils.""
A billion Earthlings are all the Solar System can hold under decent
 standards of living without exhausting what natural resources their own
 culture left us
, I thought.
We aren't ready to permit emigration; our
 own people must come first. But these beings can live well here. Only
 now that we've eliminated famine, plague, and war, they'd breed beyond
 reason, breed till all the old evils came back to throttle them, if we
 didn't have strict population control.
""Yeah,"" said her husband bitterly. ""They never even let my cousin have
 kids. Sterilized him damn near right after he was born.""
Then he's a moron, or carries hemophilia, or has some other hereditary
 taint
, I thought.
Can't they see we're doing it for their own good?
 It costs us fantastically in money and trouble, but the goal is a level
 of health and sanity such as this race never in its history dreamed
 possible.
""They're stranglin' faith,"" muttered someone else.
Anyone in the Empire may worship as he chooses, but should permission
 be granted to preach demonstrable falsehoods, archaic superstitions, or
 antisocial nonsense? The old ""free"" Earth was not noted for liberalism.
""We want to be free.""
Free? Free for what? To loose the thousand Earthly races and creeds
 and nationalisms on each other—and on the Galaxy—to wallow in
 barbarism and slaughter and misery as before we came? To let our
 works and culture be thrown in the dust, the labor of a century be
 demolished, not because it is good or bad but simply because it is
 Valgolian? Epsilon Eridanian!
""We'll be free. Not too long to wait, either—""
That's up to nobody else but you!
I couldn't get much specific information, but then I hadn't expected
 to. I collected my pay and drifted on eastward, talking to people of
 all classes—farmers, mechanics, shopowners, tramps, and such data as I
 gathered tallied with those of Intelligence.


 About twenty-five per cent of the population, in North America at
 least—it was higher in the Orient and Africa—was satisfied with the
 Imperium, felt they were better off than they would have been in the
 old days. ""The Eridanians are pretty decent, on the whole. Some of 'em
 come in here and act nice and human as you please.""


 Some fifty per cent was vaguely dissatisfied, wanted ""freedom"" without
 troubling to define the term, didn't like the taxes or the labor draft
 or the enforced disarmament or the legal and social superiority of
 Valgolians or some such thing, had perhaps suffered in the reconquest.
 But this group constituted no real threat. It would tend to be passive
 whatever happened. Its greatest contribution would be sporadic rioting.


 The remaining twenty-five per cent was bitter, waiting its chance,
 muttering of a day of revenge—and some portion of this segment was
 spreading propaganda, secretly manufacturing and distributing weapons,
 engaging in clandestine military drill, and maintaining contact with
 the shadowy Legion of Freedom.


 Childish, melodramatic name! But it had been well chosen to appeal to a
 certain type of mind. The real, organized core of the anarch movement
 was highly efficient. In those months I spent wandering and waiting,
 its activities mounted almost daily.
The illegal radio carried unending programs, propaganda, fabricated
 stories of Valgolian brutality. I knew from personal experience that
 some were false, and I knew the whole Imperial system well enough to
 spot most of the rest at least partly invented. I realized we couldn't
 trace such a well-organized setup of mobile and coordinated units, and
 jamming would have been poor tactics, but even so—
The day is coming.... Earthmen, free men, be ready to throw off your
 shackles.... Stand by for freedom!
I stuck to my role. When autumn came, I drifted into one of the native
 cities, New Chicago, a warren of buildings near the remains of the old
 settlement, the same gigantic slum that its predecessor had been. I got
 a room in a cheap hotel and a job in a steel mill.


 I was Conrad Haugen, Norwegian-American, assigned to a spaceship by the
 labor draft and liking it well enough to re-enlist when my term was
 up. I had wandered through much of the Empire and had had a great deal
 of contact with Eridanians, but was most emphatically not a Terrie. In
 fact, I thought it would be well if the redskin yoke could be thrown
 off, both because of liberty and the good pickings to be had in the
 Galaxy if the Empire should collapse. I had risen to second mate on an
 interstellar tramp, but could get no further because of the law that
 the two highest officers must be Valgolian. That had embittered me and
 I returned to Earth, foot-loose and looking for trouble.
I found it. With officer's training and the strength due to a home
 planet with a gravity half again that of Earth, I had no difficulty at
 all becoming a foreman. There was a big fellow named Mike Riley who
 thought he was entitled to the job. We settled it behind a shed, with
 the workmen looking on, and I beat him unconscious as fast as possible.
 The raw, sweating savagery of it made me feel ill inside.
They'd let
this
loose among the stars
!
After that I was one of the boys and Riley was my best friend. We went
 out together, wenching and drinking, raising hell in the cold dirty
 canyons of steel and stone which the natives called streets.
Valgolia,
 Valgolia, the clean bare windswept heights of your mountains, soughing
 trees and thunderous waters and Maara waiting for me to come home!
Riley often proposed that we find an Eridanian and beat him to death,
 and I would agree, hiccupping, because I knew they didn't go alone
 into native quarters any more. I sat in the smoky reek of the bars,
 half deafened by the clatter and raucousness called music, trying not
 to think of a certain low-ceilinged, quiet tavern amid the gardens of
 Kalariho, and sobbed the bitterness of Conrad Haugen into my beer.


 ""Dirty redskins,"" I muttered. ""Dirty, stinking, bald-headed, sons of
 bitches. Them and their god-damn Empire. Why, y'know, if 't hadn' been
 f' their laws I'd be skipper o' my own ship now. I knew more'n that
 slob o' a captain. But he was born Eridanian—God, to get my hands on
 his throat!""


 Riley nodded. Through the haze of smoke I saw that his eyes were
 narrowed. He wasn't drunk when he didn't want to be, and at times like
 this he was suddenly as sober as I was, and that in spite of not having
 a Valgolian liver.


 I bided my time, not too obviously anxious to contact the Legion. I
 just thought they were swell fellows, the only brave men left in the
 rotten, stinking Empire; I'd sure be on their side when the day came. I
 worked in the mill, and when out with the boys lamented the fact that
 we were really producing for the damned Eridanians, we couldn't even
 keep the products of our own sweat. I wasn't obtrusive about it, of
 course. Most of the time we were just boozing. But when the talk came
 to the Empire, I made it clear just where I stood.
The winter went. I continued the dreary round of days, wondering how
 long it would take, wondering how much time was left. If the Legion
 was at all interested, they would be checking my background right now.
 Let them. There wouldn't be much to check, but what there was had been
 carefully manufactured by the experts of the Intelligence Service.


 Riley came into my room one evening. His face was tight, and he plunged
 to business. ""Con, do you really mean all you've said about the Empire?""


 ""Why, of course. I—"" I glanced out the window, as if expecting to
 see a spy. If there were any, I knew he would be native. The Empire
 just doesn't have enough men for a secret police, even if we wanted to
 indulge in that sort of historically ineffective control.


 ""You'd like to fight them? Like really to help the Legion of Freedom
 when they strike?""


 ""You bet your obscenity life!"" I snarled. ""When they land on Earth,
 I'll get a gun somewhere and be right there in the middle of the battle
 with them!""


 ""Yeah."" Riley puffed a cigaret for a while. Then he said, ""Look, I
 can't tell you much. I'm taking a chance just telling you this. It
 could mean my life if you passed it on to the Eridanians.""


 ""I won't.""


 His eyes were bleak. ""You damn well better not. If you're caught at
 that—""


 He drew a finger sharply across his throat.


 ""Quit talking like a B-class stereo,"" I bristled. ""If you've got
 something to tell me, let's have it. Otherwise get out.""


 ""Yeah, sure. We checked up on you, Con, and we think you're as good a
 prospect as we ever came across. If you want to fight the Eridanians
 now—
join the Legion
now—here's your chance.""


 ""My God, you know I do! But who—""


 ""I can't tell you a thing. But if you really want to join, memorize
 this."" Riley gave me a small card on which was written a name and
 address. ""Destroy it, thoroughly. Then quit at the mill and drift to
 this other place, as if you'd gotten tired of your work and wanted to
 hit the road again. Take your time, don't make a beeline for it. When
 you do arrive, they'll take care of you.""


 I nodded, grimly. ""I'll do it, Mike. And thanks!""


 ""Just my job."" He smiled, relaxing, and pulled a flask from his
 overcoat. ""Okay, Con, that's that. We'd better not go out to drink,
 after this, but nothing's to stop us from getting stinko here.""
III


 Spring had come and almost gone when I wandered into the little Maine
 town which was my destination. It lay out of the way, with forested
 hills behind it and the sea at its foot. Most of the houses were old,
 solidly built, almost like parts of the land, and the inhabitants were
 slow-spoken, steady folk, fishermen and artisans and the like, settled
 here and at home with the darkling woods and the restless sea and the
 high windy sky. I walked down a narrow street with a cool salt breeze
 ruffling my hair and decided that I liked Portsboro. It reminded me of
 my own home, twenty light-years away on the wide beaches of Kealvigh.


 I made my way to Nat Hawkins' store and asked for work like any
 drifter. But when we were alone in the back room, I told him, ""I'm
 Conrad Haugen. Mike Riley said you'd be looking for me.""


 He nodded calmly. ""I've been expecting you. You can work here a few
 days, sleep at my house, and we'll run the tests after dark.""


 He was old for an Earthling, well over sixty, with white hair and lined
 leathery face. But his blue eyes were as keen and steady, his gnarled
 hands as strong and sure as those of any young man. He spoke softly
 and steadily, around the pipe which rarely left his mouth, and there
 was a serenity in him which I could hardly associate with anarch
 fanaticism. But the first night he led me into his cellar, and through
 a well-hidden trapdoor to a room below, and there he had a complete
 psychological laboratory.


 I gaped at the gleaming apparatus. ""How off Earth—""


 ""It came piece by piece, much of it from Epsilon Eridani itself,"" he
 smiled. ""There is, after all, no ban on humans owning such material.
 But to play safe, we spread the purchases over several years, and made
 them in the names of many people.""


 ""But you—""


 ""I took a degree in psychiatry once. I can handle this.""


 He could. He put me through the mill in the next few
 nights—intelligence tests, psychometry, encephalography, narcosis,
 psycho-probing, everything his machines and his skill could cover. He
 did not find out anything we hadn't meant to be found out. The Service
 had ways of guarding its agents with counter-blocks. But he got a very
 thorough picture of Conrad Haugen.


 In the end he said, still calmly, ""This is amazing. You have an
 IQ well over the borderline of genius, an astonishing variety of
 assorted knowledge about the Empire and about technical subjects, and
 an implacable hatred of Eridanian rule—based on personal pique and
 containing self-seeking elements, but no less firm for that. You're out
 for yourself, but you'll stand by your comrades and your cause. We'd
 never hoped for more recruits of your caliber.""


 ""When do I start?"" I asked impatiently.


 ""Easy, easy,"" he smiled. ""There's time. We've waited fifty years; we
 can wait a while longer."" He riffled through the dossier. ""Actually,
 the difficulty is where to assign you. A man who knows astrogation, the
 use of weapons and machines, and the Empire, who is physically strong
 as a bull, can lead men, and has a dozen other accomplishments, really
 seems wasted on any single job. I'm not sure, but I think you'll do
 best as a roving agent, operating between Main Base and the planets
 where we have cells, and helping with the work at the base when you're
 there.""

The Fustians looked like turtles—but

 they could move fast when they chose!

Across the table from Retief, Ambassador Magnan rustled a stiff sheet
 of parchment and looked grave.


 ""This aide memoire,"" he said, ""was just handed to me by the Cultural
 Attache. It's the third on the subject this week. It refers to the
 matter of sponsorship of Youth groups—""


 ""Some youths,"" Retief said. ""Average age, seventy-five.""


 ""The Fustians are a long-lived people,"" Magnan snapped. ""These matters
 are relative. At seventy-five, a male Fustian is at a trying age—""


 ""That's right. He'll try anything—in the hope it will maim somebody.""


 ""Precisely the problem,"" Magnan said. ""But the Youth Movement is
 the important news in today's political situation here on Fust. And
 sponsorship of Youth groups is a shrewd stroke on the part of the
 Terrestrial Embassy. At my suggestion, well nigh every member of the
 mission has leaped at the opportunity to score a few p—that is, cement
 relations with this emergent power group—the leaders of the future.
 You, Retief, as Councillor, are the outstanding exception.""


 ""I'm not convinced these hoodlums need my help in organizing their
 rumbles,"" Retief said. ""Now, if you have a proposal for a pest control
 group—""


 ""To the Fustians this is no jesting matter,"" Magnan cut in. ""This
 group—"" he glanced at the paper—""known as the Sexual, Cultural, and
 Athletic Recreational Society, or SCARS for short, has been awaiting
 sponsorship for a matter of weeks now.""


 ""Meaning they want someone to buy them a clubhouse, uniforms, equipment
 and anything else they need to complete their sexual, cultural and
 athletic development,"" Retief said.


 ""If we don't act promptly,"" Magnan said, ""the Groaci Embassy may well
 anticipate us. They're very active here.""


 ""That's an idea,"" said Retief. ""Let 'em. After awhile they'll go broke
 instead of us.""


 ""Nonsense. The group requires a sponsor. I can't actually order you to
 step forward. However...."" Magnan let the sentence hang in the air.
 Retief raised one eyebrow.


 ""For a minute there,"" he said, ""I thought you were going to make a
 positive statement.""
Magnan leaned back, lacing his fingers over his stomach. ""I don't think
 you'll find a diplomat of my experience doing anything so naive,"" he
 said.


 ""I like the adult Fustians,"" said Retief. ""Too bad they have to lug
 half a ton of horn around on their backs. I wonder if surgery would
 help.""


 ""Great heavens, Retief,"" Magnan sputtered. ""I'm amazed that even you
 would bring up a matter of such delicacy. A race's unfortunate physical
 characteristics are hardly a fit matter for Terrestrial curiosity.""


 ""Well, of course your experience of the Fustian mentality is greater
 than mine. I've only been here a month. But it's been my experience,
 Mr. Ambassador, that few races are above improving on nature. Otherwise
 you, for example, would be tripping over your beard.""


 Magnan shuddered. ""Please—never mention the idea to a Fustian.""


 Retief stood. ""My own program for the day includes going over to the
 dockyards. There are some features of this new passenger liner the
 Fustians are putting together that I want to look into. With your
 permission, Mr. Ambassador...?""


 Magnan snorted. ""Your pre-occupation with the trivial disturbs me,
 Retief. More interest in substantive matters—such as working with
 Youth groups—would create a far better impression.""


 ""Before getting too involved with these groups, it might be a good idea
 to find out a little more about them,"" said Retief. ""Who organizes
 them? There are three strong political parties here on Fust. What's the
 alignment of this SCARS organization?""


 ""You forget, these are merely teenagers, so to speak,"" Magnan said.
 ""Politics mean nothing to them ... yet.""


 ""Then there are the Groaci. Why their passionate interest in a
 two-horse world like Fust? Normally they're concerned with nothing but
 business. But what has Fust got that they could use?""


 ""You may rule out the commercial aspect in this instance,"" said Magnan.
 ""Fust possesses a vigorous steel-age manufacturing economy. The Groaci
 are barely ahead of them.""


 ""Barely,"" said Retief. ""Just over the line into crude atomics ... like
 fission bombs.""


 Magnan shook his head, turned back to his papers. ""What market exists
 for such devices on a world at peace? I suggest you address your
 attention to the less spectacular but more rewarding work of studying
 the social patterns of the local youth.""


 ""I've studied them,"" said Retief. ""And before I meet any of the local
 youth socially I want to get myself a good blackjack.""
II


 Retief left the sprawling bungalow-type building that housed the
 chancery of the Terrestrial Embassy, swung aboard a passing flat-car
 and leaned back against the wooden guard rail as the heavy vehicle
 trundled through the city toward the looming gantries of the shipyards.


 It was a cool morning. A light breeze carried the fishy odor of Fusty
 dwellings across the broad cobbled avenue. A few mature Fustians
 lumbered heavily along in the shade of the low buildings, audibly
 wheezing under the burden of their immense carapaces. Among them,
 shell-less youths trotted briskly on scaly stub legs. The driver of the
 flat-car, a labor-caste Fustian with his guild colors emblazoned on his
 back, heaved at the tiller, swung the unwieldy conveyance through the
 shipyard gates, creaked to a halt.


 ""Thus I come to the shipyard with frightful speed,"" he said in Fustian.
 ""Well I know the way of the naked-backs, who move always in haste.""


 Retief climbed down, handed him a coin. ""You should take up
 professional racing,"" he said. ""Daredevil.""


 He crossed the littered yard and tapped at the door of a rambling shed.
 Boards creaked inside. Then the door swung back.


 A gnarled ancient with tarnished facial scales and a weathered carapace
 peered out at Retief.


 ""Long-may-you-sleep,"" said Retief. ""I'd like to take a look around, if
 you don't mind. I understand you're laying the bedplate for your new
 liner today.""
""May-you-dream-of-the-deeps,"" the old fellow mumbled. He waved a stumpy
 arm toward a group of shell-less Fustians standing by a massive hoist.
 ""The youths know more of bedplates than do I, who but tend the place of
 papers.""


 ""I know how you feel, old-timer,"" said Retief. ""That sounds like the
 story of my life. Among your papers do you have a set of plans for the
 vessel? I understand it's to be a passenger liner.""


 The oldster nodded. He shuffled to a drawing file, rummaged, pulled out
 a sheaf of curled prints and spread them on the table. Retief stood
 silently, running a finger over the uppermost drawing, tracing lines....


 ""What does the naked-back here?"" barked a deep voice behind Retief. He
 turned. A heavy-faced Fustian youth, wrapped in a mantle, stood at the
 open door. Beady yellow eyes set among fine scales bored into Retief.


 ""I came to take a look at your new liner,"" said Retief.


 ""We need no prying foreigners here,"" the youth snapped. His eye fell on
 the drawings. He hissed in sudden anger.


 ""Doddering hulk!"" he snapped at the ancient. ""May you toss in
 nightmares! Put by the plans!""


 ""My mistake,"" Retief said. ""I didn't know this was a secret project.""
The youth hesitated. ""It is not a secret project,"" he muttered. ""Why
 should it be secret?""


 ""You tell me.""


 The youth worked his jaws and rocked his head from side to side in the
 Fusty gesture of uncertainty. ""There is nothing to conceal,"" he said.
 ""We merely construct a passenger liner.""


 ""Then you don't mind if I look over the drawings,"" said Retief. ""Who
 knows? Maybe some day I'll want to reserve a suite for the trip out.""


 The youth turned and disappeared. Retief grinned at the oldster. ""Went
 for his big brother, I guess,"" he said. ""I have a feeling I won't get
 to study these in peace here. Mind if I copy them?""


 ""Willingly, light-footed one,"" said the old Fustian. ""And mine is the
 shame for the discourtesy of youth.""


 Retief took out a tiny camera, flipped a copying lens in place, leafed
 through the drawings, clicking the shutter.


 ""A plague on these youths,"" said the oldster, ""who grow more virulent
 day by day.""


 ""Why don't you elders clamp down?""


 ""Agile are they and we are slow of foot. And this unrest is new.
 Unknown in my youth was such insolence.""


 ""The police—""


 ""Bah!"" the ancient rumbled. ""None have we worthy of the name, nor have
 we needed ought ere now.""


 ""What's behind it?""


 ""They have found leaders. The spiv, Slock, is one. And I fear they plot
 mischief."" He pointed to the window. ""They come, and a Soft One with
 them.""


 Retief pocketed the camera, glanced out the window. A pale-featured
 Groaci with an ornately decorated crest stood with the youths, who eyed
 the hut, then started toward it.


 ""That's the military attache of the Groaci Embassy,"" Retief said. ""I
 wonder what he and the boys are cooking up together?""


 ""Naught that augurs well for the dignity of Fust,"" the oldster rumbled.
 ""Flee, agile one, while I engage their attentions.""


 ""I was just leaving,"" Retief said. ""Which way out?""


 ""The rear door,"" the Fustian gestured with a stubby member. ""Rest well,
 stranger on these shores."" He moved to the entrance.


 ""Same to you, pop,"" said Retief. ""And thanks.""


 He eased through the narrow back entrance, waited until voices were
 raised at the front of the shed, then strolled off toward the gate.
The second dark of the third cycle was lightening when Retief left the
 Embassy technical library and crossed the corridor to his office. He
 flipped on a light. A note was tucked under a paperweight:


 ""Retief—I shall expect your attendance at the IAS dinner at first
 dark of the fourth cycle. There will be a brief but, I hope, impressive
 Sponsorship ceremony for the SCARS group, with full press coverage,
 arrangements for which I have managed to complete in spite of your
 intransigence.""


 Retief snorted and glanced at his watch. Less than three hours. Just
 time to creep home by flat-car, dress in ceremonial uniform and creep
 back.


 Outside he flagged a lumbering bus. He stationed himself in a corner
 and watched the yellow sun, Beta, rise rapidly above the low skyline.
 The nearby sea was at high tide now, under the pull of the major sun
 and the three moons, and the stiff breeze carried a mist of salt spray.


 Retief turned up his collar against the dampness. In half an hour he
 would be perspiring under the vertical rays of a third-noon sun, but
 the thought failed to keep the chill off.


 Two Youths clambered up on the platform, moving purposefully toward
 Retief. He moved off the rail, watching them, weight balanced.


 ""That's close enough, kids,"" he said. ""Plenty of room on this scow. No
 need to crowd up.""


 ""There are certain films,"" the lead Fustian muttered. His voice was
 unusually deep for a Youth. He was wrapped in a heavy cloak and moved
 awkwardly. His adolescence was nearly at an end, Retief guessed.


 ""I told you once,"" said Retief. ""Don't crowd me.""


 The two stepped close, slit mouths snapping in anger. Retief put out a
 foot, hooked it behind the scaly leg of the overaged juvenile and threw
 his weight against the cloaked chest. The clumsy Fustian tottered, fell
 heavily. Retief was past him and off the flat-car before the other
 Youth had completed his vain lunge toward the spot Retief had occupied.
 The Terrestrial waved cheerfully at the pair, hopped aboard another
 vehicle, watched his would-be assailants lumber down from their car,
 tiny heads twisted to follow his retreating figure.


 So they wanted the film? Retief reflected, thumbing a cigar alight.
 They were a little late. He had already filed it in the Embassy vault,
 after running a copy for the reference files.


 And a comparison of the drawings with those of the obsolete Mark XXXV
 battle cruiser used two hundred years earlier by the Concordiat Naval
 Arm showed them to be almost identical, gun emplacements and all. The
 term ""obsolete"" was a relative one. A ship which had been outmoded in
 the armories of the Galactic Powers could still be king of the walk in
 the Eastern Arm.


 But how had these two known of the film? There had been no one present
 but himself and the old-timer—and he was willing to bet the elderly
 Fustian hadn't told them anything.


 At least not willingly....


 Retief frowned, dropped the cigar over the side, waited until the
 flat-car negotiated a mud-wallow, then swung down and headed for the
 shipyard.
The door, hinges torn loose, had been propped loosely back in position.
 Retief looked around at the battered interior of the shed. The old
 fellow had put up a struggle.


 There were deep drag-marks in the dust behind the building. Retief
 followed them across the yard. They disappeared under the steel door of
 a warehouse.


 Retief glanced around. Now, at the mid-hour of the fourth cycle, the
 workmen were heaped along the edge of the refreshment pond, deep in
 their siesta. He took a multi-bladed tool from a pocket, tried various
 fittings in the lock. It snicked open.


 He eased the door aside far enough to enter.


 Heaped bales loomed before him. Snapping on the tiny lamp in the handle
 of the combination tool, Retief looked over the pile. One stack seemed
 out of alignment ... and the dust had been scraped from the floor
 before it. He pocketed the light, climbed up on the bales, looked over
 into a nest made by stacking the bundles around a clear spot. The aged
 Fustian lay in it, on his back, a heavy sack tied over his head.


 Retief dropped down inside the ring of bales, sawed at the tough twine
 and pulled the sack free.


 ""It's me, old fellow,"" Retief said. ""The nosy stranger. Sorry I got you
 into this.""


 The oldster threshed his gnarled legs. He rocked slightly and fell
 back. ""A curse on the cradle that rocked their infant slumbers,"" he
 rumbled. ""But place me back on my feet and I hunt down the youth,
 Slock, though he flee to the bottommost muck of the Sea of Torments.""


 ""How am I going to get you out of here? Maybe I'd better get some help.""


 ""Nay. The perfidious Youths abound here,"" said the old Fustian. ""It
 would be your life.""


 ""I doubt if they'd go that far.""


 ""Would they not?"" The Fustian stretched his neck. ""Cast your light
 here. But for the toughness of my hide....""


 Retief put the beam of the light on the leathery neck. A great smear of
 thick purplish blood welled from a ragged cut. The oldster chuckled, a
 sound like a seal coughing.


 ""Traitor, they called me. For long they sawed at me—in vain. Then
 they trussed me and dumped me here. They think to return with weapons
 to complete the task.""


 ""Weapons? I thought it was illegal!""


 ""Their evil genius, the Soft One,"" said the Fustian. ""He would provide
 fuel to the Devil himself.""


 ""The Groaci again,"" said Retief. ""I wonder what their angle is.""


 ""And I must confess, I told them of you, ere I knew their full
 intentions. Much can I tell you of their doings. But first, I pray, the
 block and tackle.""


 Retief found the hoist where the Fustian directed him, maneuvered it
 into position, hooked onto the edge of the carapace and hauled away.
 The immense Fustian rose slowly, teetered ... then flopped on his chest.


 Slowly he got to his feet.


 ""My name is Whonk, fleet one,"" he said. ""My cows are yours.""


 ""Thanks. I'm Retief. I'd like to meet the girls some time. But right
 now, let's get out of here.""


 Whonk leaned his bulk against the ponderous stacks of baled kelp,
 bulldozed them aside. ""Slow am I to anger,"" he said, ""but implacable in
 my wrath. Slock, beware!""


 ""Hold it,"" said Retief suddenly. He sniffed. ""What's that odor?"" He
 flashed the light around, played it over a dry stain on the floor. He
 knelt, sniffed at the spot.


 ""What kind of cargo was stacked here, Whonk? And where is it now?""


 Whonk considered. ""There were drums,"" he said. ""Four of them, quite
 small, painted an evil green, the property of the Soft Ones, the
 Groaci. They lay here a day and a night. At full dark of the first
 period they came with stevedores and loaded them aboard the barge
Moss
 Rock
.""


 ""The VIP boat. Who's scheduled to use it?""


 ""I know not. But what matters this? Let us discuss cargo movements
 after I have settled a score with certain Youths.""


 ""We'd better follow this up first, Whonk. There's only one substance I
 know of that's transported in drums and smells like that blot on the
 floor. That's titanite: the hottest explosive this side of a uranium
 pile.""
III


 Beta was setting as Retief, Whonk puffing at his heels, came up to the
 sentry box beside the gangway leading to the plush interior of the
 official luxury space barge
Moss Rock
.


 ""A sign of the times,"" said Whonk, glancing inside the empty shelter.
 ""A guard should stand here, but I see him not. Doubtless he crept away
 to sleep.""


 ""Let's go aboard and take a look around.""


 They entered the ship. Soft lights glowed in utter silence. A rough box
 stood on the floor, rollers and pry-bars beside it—a discordant note
 in the muted luxury of the setting. Whonk rummaged in it.


 ""Curious,"" he said. ""What means this?"" He held up a stained cloak of
 orange and green, a metal bracelet, papers.


 ""Orange and green,"" mused Relief. ""Whose colors are those?""


 ""I know not."" Whonk glanced at the arm-band. ""But this is lettered."" He
 passed the metal band to Retief.


 ""SCARS,"" Retief read. He looked at Whonk. ""It seems to me I've heard
 the name before,"" he murmured. ""Let's get back to the Embassy—fast.""


 Back on the ramp Retief heard a sound ... and turned in time to duck
 the charge of a hulking Fustian youth who thundered past him and
 fetched up against the broad chest of Whonk, who locked him in a warm
 embrace.


 ""Nice catch, Whonk. Where'd he sneak out of?""


 ""The lout hid there by the storage bin,"" rumbled Whonk. The captive
 youth thumped fists and toes fruitlessly against the oldster's carapace.


 ""Hang onto him,"" said Retief. ""He looks like the biting kind.""


 ""No fear. Clumsy I am, yet not without strength.""


 ""Ask him where the titanite is tucked away.""


 ""Speak, witless grub,"" growled Whonk, ""lest I tweak you in twain.""


 The youth gurgled.


 ""Better let up before you make a mess of him,"" said Retief. Whonk
 lifted the Youth clear of the floor, then flung him down with a thump
 that made the ground quiver. The younger Fustian glared up at the
 elder, mouth snapping.


 ""This one was among those who trussed me and hid me away for the
 killing,"" said Whonk. ""In his repentance he will tell all to his elder.""


 ""That's the same young squirt that tried to strike up an acquaintance
 with me on the bus,"" Retief said. ""He gets around.""


 The youth scrambled to hands and knees, scuttled for freedom. Retief
 planted a foot on his dragging cloak; it ripped free. He stared at the
 bare back of the Fustian—


 ""By the Great Egg!"" Whonk exclaimed, tripping the refugee as he tried
 to rise. ""This is no Youth! His carapace has been taken from him!""


 Retief looked at the scarred back. ""I thought he looked a little old.
 But I thought—""


 ""This is not possible,"" Whonk said wonderingly. ""The great nerve trunks
 are deeply involved. Not even the cleverest surgeon could excise the
 carapace and leave the patient living.""


 ""It looks like somebody did the trick. But let's take this boy with us
 and get out of here. His folks may come home.""


 ""Too late,"" said Whonk. Retief turned.


 Three youths came from behind the sheds.


 ""Well,"" Retief said. ""It looks like the SCARS are out in force tonight.
 Where's your pal?"" he said to the advancing trio. ""The sticky little
 bird with the eye-stalks? Back at his Embassy, leaving you suckers
 holding the bag, I'll bet.""


 ""Shelter behind me, Retief,"" said Whonk.


 ""Go get 'em, old-timer."" Retief stooped, picked up one of the pry-bars.
 ""I'll jump around and distract them.""


 Whonk let out a whistling roar and charged for the immature Fustians.
 They fanned out ... and one tripped, sprawled on his face. Retief
 whirled the metal bar he had thrust between the Fustian's legs, slammed
 it against the skull of another, who shook his head, turned on
 Retief ... and bounced off the steel hull of the
Moss Rock
as Whonk
 took him in full charge.


 Retief used the bar on another head. His third blow laid the Fustian
 on the pavement, oozing purple. The other two club members departed
 hastily, seriously dented but still mobile.


 Retief leaned on his club, breathing hard. ""Tough heads these kids
 have got. I'm tempted to chase those two lads down, but I've got
 another errand to run. I don't know who the Groaci intended to blast,
 but I have a sneaking suspicion somebody of importance was scheduled
 for a boat ride in the next few hours. And three drums of titanite is
 enough to vaporize this tub and everyone aboard her.""


 ""The plot is foiled,"" said Whonk. ""But what reason did they have?""


 ""The Groaci are behind it. I have an idea the SCARS didn't know about
 this gambit.""


 ""Which of these is the leader?"" asked Whonk. He prodded a fallen Youth
 with a horny toe. ""Arise, dreaming one.""


 ""Never mind him, Whonk. We'll tie these two up and leave them here. I
 know where to find the boss.""
A stolid crowd filled the low-ceilinged banquet hall. Retief scanned
 the tables for the pale blobs of Terrestrial faces, dwarfed by the
 giant armored bodies of the Fustians. Across the room Magnan fluttered
 a hand. Retief headed toward him. A low-pitched vibration filled the
 air: the rumble of subsonic Fustian music.


 Retief slid into his place beside Magnan. ""Sorry to be late, Mr.
 Ambassador.""


 ""I'm honored that you chose to appear at all,"" said Magnan coldly. He
 turned back to the Fustian on his left.


 ""Ah, yes, Mr. Minister,"" he said. ""Charming, most charming. So joyous.""


 The Fustian looked at him, beady-eyed. ""It is the
Lament of
 Hatching
,"" he said; ""our National Dirge.""


 ""Oh,"" said Magnan. ""How interesting. Such a pleasing balance of
 instruments—""


 ""It is a droon solo,"" said the Fustian, eyeing the Terrestrial
 Ambassador suspiciously.


 ""Why don't you just admit you can't hear it,"" Retief whispered loudly.
 ""And if I may interrupt a moment—""


 Magnan cleared his throat. ""Now that our Mr. Retief has arrived,
 perhaps we could rush right along to the Sponsorship ceremonies.""


 ""This group,"" said Retief, leaning across Magnan, ""the SCARS. How much
 do you know about them, Mr. Minister?""


 ""Nothing at all,"" the huge Fustian elder rumbled. ""For my taste, all
 Youths should be kept penned with the livestock until they grow a
 carapace to tame their irresponsibility.""


 ""We mustn't lose sight of the importance of channeling youthful
 energies,"" said Magnan.


 ""Labor gangs,"" said the minister. ""In my youth we were indentured to
 the dredge-masters. I myself drew a muck sledge.""


 ""But in these modern times,"" put in Magnan, ""surely it's incumbent on
 us to make happy these golden hours.""


 The minister snorted. ""Last week I had a golden hour. They set upon me
 and pelted me with overripe stench-fruit.""


 ""But this was merely a manifestation of normal youthful frustrations,""
 cried Magnan. ""Their essential tenderness—""


 ""You'd not find a tender spot on that lout yonder,"" the minister
 said, pointing with a fork at a newly arrived Youth, ""if you drilled
 boreholes and blasted.""
""Why, that's our guest of honor,"" said Magnan, ""a fine young fellow!
 Slop I believe his name is.""


 ""Slock,"" said Retief. ""Eight feet of armor-plated orneriness. And—""


 Magnan rose and tapped on his glass. The Fustians winced at the, to
 them, supersonic vibrations. They looked at each other muttering.
 Magnan tapped louder. The Minister drew in his head, eyes closed. Some
 of the Fustians rose, tottered for the doors; the noise level rose.
 Magnan redoubled his efforts. The glass broke with a clatter and green
 wine gushed on the tablecloth.


 ""What in the name of the Great Egg!"" the Minister muttered. He blinked,
 breathing deeply.


 ""Oh, forgive me,"" blurted Magnan, dabbing at the wine.


 ""Too bad the glass gave out,"" said Retief. ""In another minute you'd
 have cleared the hall. And then maybe I could have gotten a word in
 sideways. There's a matter you should know about—""


 ""Your attention, please,"" Magnan said, rising. ""I see that our fine
 young guest has arrived, and I hope that the remainder of his committee
 will be along in a moment. It is my pleasure to announce that our Mr.
 Retief has had the good fortune to win out in the keen bidding for the
 pleasure of sponsoring this lovely group.""


 Retief tugged at Magnan's sleeve. ""Don't introduce me yet,"" he said. ""I
 want to appear suddenly. More dramatic, you know.""


 ""Well,"" murmured Magnan, glancing down at Retief, ""I'm gratified to
 see you entering into the spirit of the event at last."" He turned his
 attention back to the assembled guests. ""If our honored guest will join
 me on the rostrum...?"" he said. ""The gentlemen of the press may want to
 catch a few shots of the presentation.""


 Magnan stepped up on the low platform at the center of the wide room,
 took his place beside the robed Fustian youth and beamed at the cameras.


 ""How gratifying it is to take this opportunity to express once more the
 great pleasure we have in sponsoring SCARS,"" he said, talking slowly
 for the benefit of the scribbling reporters. ""We'd like to think that
 in our modest way we're to be a part of all that the SCARS achieve
 during the years ahead.""


 Magnan paused as a huge Fustian elder heaved his bulk up the two low
 steps to the rostrum, approached the guest of honor. He watched as the
 newcomer paused behind Slock, who did not see the new arrival.


 Retief pushed through the crowd, stepped up to face the Fustian youth.
 Slock stared at him, drew back.


 ""You know me, Slock,"" said Retief loudly. ""An old fellow named Whonk
 told you about me, just before you tried to saw his head off, remember?
 It was when I came out to take a look at that battle cruiser you're
 building.""
IV


 With a bellow Slock reached for Retief—and choked off in mid-cry as
 the Fustian elder, Whonk, pinioned him from behind, lifting him clear
 of the floor.


 ""Glad you reporters happened along,"" said Retief to the gaping newsmen.
 ""Slock here had a deal with a sharp operator from the Groaci Embassy.
 The Groaci were to supply the necessary hardware and Slock, as foreman
 at the shipyards, was to see that everything was properly installed.
 The next step, I assume, would have been a local take-over, followed
 by a little interplanetary war on Flamenco or one of the other nearby
 worlds ... for which the Groaci would be glad to supply plenty of ammo.""


 Magnan found his tongue. ""Are you mad, Retief?"" he screeched. ""This
 group was vouched for by the Ministry of Youth!""


 ""The Ministry's overdue for a purge,"" snapped Retief. He turned back
 to Slock. ""I wonder if you were in on the little diversion that was
 planned for today. When the
Moss Rock
blew, a variety of clues were
 to be planted where they'd be easy to find ... with SCARS written all
 over them. The Groaci would thus have neatly laid the whole affair
 squarely at the door of the Terrestrial Embassy ... whose sponsorship
 of the SCARS had received plenty of publicity.""


 ""The
Moss Rock
?"" said Magnan. ""But that was—Retief! This is idiotic.
 Slock himself was scheduled to go on a cruise tomorrow!""


 Slock roared suddenly, twisting violently. Whonk teetered, his grip
 loosened ... and Slock pulled free and was off the platform, butting
 his way through the milling oldsters on the dining room floor. Magnan
 watched, open-mouthed.


 ""The Groaci were playing a double game, as usual,"" Retief said. ""They
 intended to dispose of this fellow Slock, once he'd served their
 purpose.""


 ""Well, don't stand there,"" yelped Magnan over the uproar. ""If Slock is
 the ring-leader of a delinquent gang...!"" He moved to give chase.


 Retief grabbed his arm. ""Don't jump down there! You'd have as much
 chance of getting through as a jack-rabbit through a threshing contest.""


 Ten minutes later the crowd had thinned slightly. ""We can get through
 now,"" Whonk called. ""This way."" He lowered himself to the floor, bulled
 through to the exit. Flashbulbs popped. Retief and Magnan followed in
 Whonk's wake.


 In the lounge Retief grabbed the phone, waited for the operator, gave a
 code letter. No reply. He tried another.


 ""No good,"" he said after a full minute had passed. ""Wonder what's
 loose?"" He slammed the phone back in its niche. ""Let's grab a cab.""

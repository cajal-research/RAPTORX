         Early in American Beauty , Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), a weary reporter for a media magazine, masturbates in the shower while informing us in voice-over that we're witnessing the highlight of his day. He peers through tired eyes out the window at his manicured suburban tract-house lawn, where his wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening)--whose gardening clogs, he points out, are color-coordinated with the handles of her shears--snips roses (American beauties) and twitters about Miracle-Gro to a gay yuppie (Scott Bakula) on the other side of a white picket fence. ""I have lost something,"" says Lester. ""I'm not exactly sure what it is but I know I didn't always feel this ... sedated."" Apparently, Lester doesn't realize that snipped roses are garden-variety symbols of castration, or he'd know what he has lost. But the makers of American Beauty are about to give Lester his roses back. At a high-school basketball game, Lester is transfixed by a blonde cheerleader named Angela (Mena Suvari), who is twirling alongside his daughter, Jane (Thora Burch). Ambient noise falls away, the crowd disappears, and there she is, Lester's angel, writhing in slow motion--just for him. She opens her jacket (she's naked underneath) and red rose petals drift out. Later, Lester envisions her on a bed of red petals, then immersed in a bath of red petals. Back in the roses for the first time in years, he's soon pumping iron, smoking pot, and telling off his frigid wife and faceless bosses, convinced that whatever he has lost he's getting back, baby. 

         The movie is convinced, too--which is odd, since the fantasy of an underage cheerleader making a middle-aged man's wilted roses bloom is a tad ... primitive. But American Beauty doesn't feel primitive. It feels lustrously hip and aware, and a lot of critics are making big claims for it. The script, by Alan Ball, a playwright and former sitcom writer, carries an invigorating blast of counterculture righteousness, along with the kind of pithily vicious marital bickering that makes some viewers (especially male) say, ""Yeah! Tell that bitch off!"" More important, it has a vein of metaphysical yearning, which the director, Sam Mendes, mines brilliantly. A hotshot English theater director (his Cabaret revival is still on the boards in New York), Mendes gives the film a patina of New Age lyricism and layer upon layer of visual irony. The movie's surface is velvety and immaculate--until the action is abruptly viewed through the video camera of the teen-age voyeur next door (Wes Bentley), and the graininess of the video image (along with the plangent music) suggests how unstable the molecules that constitute our ""reality"" really are. Mendes can distend the real into the surreal with imperceptible puffs. Aided by his cinematographer, Conrad Hall, and editors, Tariq Anwar and Chris Greenbury, he creates an entrancing vision of the American nuclear family on the verge of a meltdown. 

         A merican                 Beauty is so wittily written and gorgeously directed that you might think you're seeing something archetypal--maybe even the Great American Movie. But when you stop and smell the roses ... Well, that scent isn't Miracle-Gro. The hairpin turns from farce to melodrama, from satire to bathos, are fresh and deftly navigated, but almost every one of the underlying attitudes is smug and easy: from the corporate flunky named ""Brad"" to the interchangeable gay neighbors (they're both called ""Jim"") to the brutally homophobic patriarch next door, an ex-Marine colonel (Chris Cooper) who has reduced his wife (the normally exuberant Allison Janney) to a catatonic mummy and his son, Ricky (Bentley), to a life of subterranean deception. (The colonel's idea of bliss is watching an old Ronald Reagan military picture on television: How's that for subtle?) Lester's wife, Carolyn, is even more stridently caricatured. A real-estate broker who fails to sell a big house (her only potential customers are blank-faced African-Americans, Indian-Americans, and surly lesbians), she wears a mask of perky efficiency and insists on listening to Muzak while she and her husband and daughter eat her ""nutritious yet savory"" dinners. It's amazing that Mendes and Ball get away with recycling so many stale and reactionary ideas under the all-purpose rubric of ""black comedy."" 

         But it's also possible that those ideas have rarely been presented so seductively. Several months ago, Daniel Menaker in                    Slate                 in contemporary film in which the protagonist attempts to break through our cultural and technological anesthetization into ""the real."" That's the theme here, too, and it's extraordinarily potent, at times even heartbreaking. The symbols, however, have been cunningly reversed. In movies like sex, lies, and videotape (1989), the protagonist has to put away the video camera to ""get real""; in American Beauty , it's Ricky Fitts, the damaged stoner videomaker next door, who sees beauty where nonartists see only horror or nothingness. In the film's most self-consciously poetic set piece, Ricky shows Lester's dour daughter Jane--in whom he recognizes a kindred spirit--a video of a plastic bag fluttering up, down, and around on invisible currents of wind. Ricky speaks of glimpsing in the bag's trajectory an ""entire life behind things""--a ""benevolent force"" that holds the universe together. The teen-ager, who likes to train his lenses on dead bodies of animals and people, sells wildly expensive marijuana to Lester and somehow passes on this notion of ""beauty."" By the end, Lester is mouthing the same sentiments and has acquired the same deadpan radiance. That must be some really good shit they're smoking. 

         It's not the druggy philosophizing, however, that makes American Beauty an emotional workout. It's that the caricatures are grounded in sympathy instead of derision. Everyone on screen is in serious pain. The manipulative sexpot Angela, who taunts her friend Jane with the idea of seducing her dad, acts chiefly out of a terror of appearing ordinary. As the military martinet, Cooper goes against the grain, turning Col. Fitts into a sour bulldog whose capaciously baggy eyes are moist with sadness over his inability to reach out. (When he stands helplessly in the rain at the end, the deluge completes him.) The character of Carolyn is so shrill as to constitute a libel on the female sex, but there isn't a second when Bening sends the woman up. She doesn't transcend the part, she fills it to the brim, anatomizes it. You can't hate Carolyn because the woman is trying so hard--to appear confident, composed, in control. When she fails to sell that house, she closes the shades and lets go with a naked wail--it's the sound of a vacuum crying to be filled--then furiously slaps herself while sputtering, ""Shut up--you're weak--shut up. "" Then she breathes, regains her go-get-'em poise, replaces her mask. Carolyn isn't a complicated dramatic construction, but Bening gives her a primal force. An actress who packs more psychological detail into a single gesture than others get into whole scenes, Bening was barreling down the road to greatness before she hit a speed bump called Warren. It's a joy to observe her--both here and in Neil Jordan's In Dreams (1999)--back at full throttle. 

                         American Beauty is Spacey's movie, though. He gives it--how weird to write this about Spacey, who made his name playing flamboyantly self-involved psychopaths--a heart. Early on, he lets his face and posture go slack and his eyes blurry. He mugs like crazy, telegraphing Lester's ""loserness."" But Spacey's genius is for mugging in character. He makes us believe that it's Lester who's caricaturing himself , and that bitter edge paves the way for the character's later, more comfortably Spacey-like scenes of insult and mockery. He even makes us take Lester's final, improbably rhapsodic moments straight. 

         But do the filmmakers take them straight? If I read it correctly, the movie is saying that American society is unjust and absurd and loveless--full of people so afraid of seeming ordinary that they lose their capacity to see. It's saying that our only hope is to cultivate a kind of stoned aesthetic detachment whereby even a man with his brains blown out becomes an object of beauty and a signpost to a Higher Power. But to scrutinize a freshly dead body and not ask how it got that way--or if there's anyone nearby with a gun who might want to add to the body count--strikes me as either moronic or insane or both. The kind of detachment the movie is peddling isn't artistic, it isn't life--it's nihilism at its most fatuous. In the end, American Beauty is New Age Nihilism. 

         Kevin Costner is 11 years older than he was as Crash Davis, the over-the-hill minor-league catcher in Bull Durham (1988), but he can still get away with playing a professional ballplayer. He moves and acts like a celebrity jock, and he can make his narcissistic self-containment look as if he's keeping something in reserve--to protect his ""instrument,"" as it were. In For Love of the Game , he's a 40ish Detroit Tigers pitcher having his last hurrah: The team has been sold and the new owners don't necessarily want him back. For about half an hour, it's a great sports movie. Costner stands on the mound shaking off the signals of his longtime catcher (John C. Reilly); he forces himself to tune out the huge Yankee Stadium crowd (the background blurs before our eyes and the sound drops out); and he mutters darkly at a succession of batters, some old nemeses, some old buddies. 

         He also thinks about his Manhattan-based ex-girlfriend (Kelly Preston), who tearfully told him that morning that things were absolutely over and she was moving to London. There's an appealing flashback to how they met (he stopped to fix her car while on the way to Yankee Stadium), then it's back to the game for more nail-biting at bats. But pretty soon the relationship flashbacks start coming thick and fast, and the balance of the movie shifts to whether Kevin can commit to Kelly and Kelly can commit to Kevin or whether his only commitment could ever be to the ball and the diamond and the game. 

         Maybe it's because I'm a baseball nut that I hated to leave the mound. But maybe it's also because the relationships scenes are soft-focus, generic, and woozily drawn-out, whereas the stuff in the stadium is sharply edited and full of texture. The rhythms of the game feel right; the rhythms of the romance feel embarrassingly Harlequin, and the picture drags on for over two hours. I can't believe that the director, Sam Raimi ( The Evil Dead , 1983; last year's A Simple Plan ) thought that all those scenes of Costner and Preston staring into space while the piano plinks would end up in the final cut, but Raimi apparently gave up control of the final cut for the sake of making his first, real mainstream picture. He might as well have stuck his head over the plate and said, ""Bean me.""

Nothing could have seemed pleasanter than that

 peaceful planet. Then why was a non-suicidal

 man driven to suicide there? Yet it made sense.
Why do people commit suicide?
Templin tightened his safety belt and lay back on the acceleration
 bunk. The lights in the cabin dimmed to a dull, red glow that meant the
 time for takeoff was nearing. He could hear noises from deep within
 the ship and the tiny whir of the ventilator fan, filling the air with
 the sweetish smell of sleeping gas. To sleep the trip away was better
 than to face the dull monotony of the stars for days on end.
Oh, they kill themselves for lots of reasons. Maybe ill health or
 financial messes or family difficulties. An unhappy love affair. Or
 more complex ones, if you went into it deeper. The failure to achieve
 an ambition, failure to live up to one's own ideals. Weltschmerz,
 perhaps.
He could smell the bitter fragrance of tobacco smoke mingling with
 the gas. Eckert had lit a cigarette and was calmly blowing the smoke
 at the neon ""No Smoking"" sign, which winked on and off in mechanical
 disapproval.


 He turned his head slightly so he could just see Eckert in the bank
 facing him. Eckert, one of the good gray men in the Service. The old
 reliables, the ones who could take almost anything in their stride
 because, at one time or another, they had had to.
It was Eckert who had come into his office several days ago and told
 him that Don Pendleton had killed himself.
Only Pendleton wasn't the type. He was the kind who have everything
 to live for, the kind you instinctively know will amount to something
 someday. And that was a lousy way to remember him. The clichés always
 come first. Your memory plays traitor and boils friendship down to the
 status of a breakfast food testimonial.
The soft red lights seemed to be dancing in the darkness of the cabin.
 Eckert was just a dull, formless blur opposite him. His cigarette was
 out.


 Eckert had come into his office without saying a word and had watched
 his scenery-window. It had been snowing in the window, the white flakes
 making a simple pattern drifting past the glass. Eckert had fiddled
 with the controls and changed it to sunshine, then to a weird mixture
 of hail amid the brassy, golden sunlight.


 And then Eckert had told him that Pendleton had taken the short way out.
He shouldn't get sentimental. But how the hell else should he remember
 Pendleton? Try to forget it and drink a toast to him at the next class
 reunion? And never, never be so crude as to speculate why Pendleton
 should have done it? If, of course, he had....
The cabin was hazy in the reddish glow, the sleeping gas a heavy
 perfume.


 Eckert and he had talked it out and gone over the records. Pendleton
 had come of good stock. There had been no mental instability in his
 family for as far back as the genetic records went. He had been raised
 in a middle-class neighborhood and attended a local grammar school
 where he had achieved average grades and had given his instructors the
 normal amount of trouble. Later, when he had made up his mind to enter
 the Diplomatic Service, his grades had improved. He had worked hard at
 it, though he wasn't what you would call a grind. In high school and
 later in college, he was the well-balanced type, athletic, popular,
 hard-working.
How long would it be before memories faded and all there was left
 of Pendleton was a page of statistics? He had been on this team, he
 had been elected president of that, he had graduated with such and
 such honors. But try getting a picture of him by reading the records,
 resurrect him from a page of black print. Would he be human? Would
 he be flesh and blood? Hell, no! In the statistics Pendleton was the
 All-Around Boy, the cold marble statue with the finely chiseled muscles
 and the smooth, blank sockets where the eyes should be. Maybe someday
 fate would play a trick on a hero-worshiping public and there would
 actually be kids like that. But they wouldn't be human; they wouldn't
 be born. Parents would get them by sending in so many box tops.
He was drowsy; the room was filled with the gas now. It would be only a
 matter of minutes before he would be asleep.


 Pendleton had been in his second year as attache on Tunpesh, a small
 planet with a G-type sun. The Service had stumbled across it recently
 and decided the system was worth diplomatic recognition of some kind,
 so Pendleton had been sent there. He had been the first attache to be
 sent and naturally he had gone alone.


 There was no need to send more. Tunpesh had been inspected and
 certified and approved. The natives were primitive and friendly. Or
 maybe the Service had slipped up, as it sometimes did, and Tunpesh had
 received something less than a thorough survey.


 And then an unscheduled freighter had put in for repairs, one of
 the very few ships that ever came by Tunpesh. The captain had tried
 to pay his respects to Pendleton. Only Pendleton wasn't there. The
 natives said he had killed himself and showed the captain the little
 flower-covered plot where they had buried him.


 Tunpesh had been Pendleton's second assignment.
The natives were oh-so-friendly. So friendly that he had made sure
 that a certain box was on board, filled with shiny atomic rifles,
 needle pistols, and the fat little gas guns. They might be needed.
 People like Pendleton didn't kill themselves, did they? No, they
 didn't. But sometimes they were murdered.
It was almost black inside the cabin now; only a thin red line around
 the ceiling told how close they were to takeoff. His head was thick
 with drowsiness, his eyelids a heavy weight that he knew he couldn't
 keep open much longer.


 Eckert and he had been chosen to go to Tunpesh and investigate. The two
 of them, working together, should be able to find out why Pendleton had
 killed himself.
But that wasn't the real reason. Maybe Eckert thought so, but he knew
 better. The real reason they were going there was to find out why
 Pendleton had been killed and who had killed him. That was it.
Who had killed Cock Robin?
The thin red line was practically microscopic now and Templin could
 feel his lashes lying gently on his cheeks. But he wasn't asleep—not
 quite. There was something buzzing about in the dim recesses of his
 mind.


 Their information on Tunpesh was limited. They knew that it had no
 trading concessions or armed forces and that nobody from neighboring
 systems seemed to know much about it or even visited it. But a staff
 anthropologist must have been routinely assigned to Tunpesh to furnish
 data and reports.


 ""Ted?"" he murmured sleepily.


 A faint stirring in the black bulk opposite him. ""Yes?""


 ""How come our anthropologist on Tunpesh didn't come across with more
 information?""


 A drowsy mumble from the other cot: ""He wasn't there long enough. He
 committed suicide not long after landing.""


 The room was a whirling pool of blackness into which his mind was
 slowly slipping. Takeoff was only seconds away.
Why do people commit suicide?
""It's a nice day, isn't it, Ted?"" Eckert took a deep and pleasurable
 breath. ""It's the type of day that makes you feel good just to be
 alive.""


 Warm breezes rustled through Eckert's graying hair and tugged gently
 at his tunic. The air smelled as if it had been washed and faintly
 perfumed with the balsamy scent of something very much like pine. A
 few hundred yards away, a forest towered straight and slim and coolly
 inviting, and brilliantly colored birds whirled and fluttered in the
 foliage.


 The rocketport, where they were standing surrounded by their luggage,
 was a grassy valley where the all too infrequent ships could land and
 discharge cargo or make repairs. There was a blackened patch on it now,
 with little blast-ignited flames dying out around the edges.
It won't
 be long before it will be green again
, he thought. The grass looked
 as though it grew fast—it would certainly have plenty of time to grow
 before the next ship landed.


 He looked at the slim, dwindling shape that was the rocket, and was
 suddenly, acutely aware that he and Templin would be stranded for six
 months on a foreign and very possibly dangerous planet. And there would
 be no way of calling for help or of leaving before the six months were
 up.


 He stood there for a moment, drinking in the fresh air and feeling the
 warmth of the sun against his face. It might be a pleasant six months
 at that, away from the din and the hustle and confusion, spending the
 time in a place where the sun was warm and inviting.
I must be getting old
, he thought,
thinking about the warmth and
 comfort. Like old dogs and octogenarians.
Templin was looking at the scenery with a disappointed expression on
 his face. Eckert stole a side glance at him and for a fleeting moment
 felt vaguely concerned. ""Don't be disappointed if it doesn't look like
 cloak-and-dagger right off, Ray. What seems innocent enough on the
 surface can prove to be quite dangerous underneath.""


 ""It's rather hard to think of danger in a setting like this.""


 Eckert nodded agreement. ""It wouldn't fit, would it? It would be like a
 famous singer suddenly doing a jazz number in an opera, or having the
 princess in a fairy tale turn out to be ugly."" He gestured toward the
 village. ""You could hardly class that as dangerous from its outward
 appearance, could you?""


 The rocketport was in a small valley, surrounded by low, wooded hills.
 The village started where the port left off and crawled and wound over
 the wooded ridges. Small houses of sun-baked, white-washed mud crouched
 in the shadow of huge trees and hugged the banks of a small stream.


 It looked fairly primitive, Eckert thought, and yet it didn't have the
 earmarks, the characteristics of most primitive villages. It didn't
 seem cluttered or dirty and you didn't feel like beating a hasty
 retreat when the wind was blowing toward you.


 A few adults were watching them curiously and the usual bunch of
 kids that always congregated around rocketports quickly gathered.
 Eckert stared at them for a moment, wondering what it was that seemed
 odd about them, and they stared back with all the alert dignity of
 childhood. They finally came out on the field and clustered around him
 and Templin.


 Templin studied them warily. ""Better watch them, Ted. Even kids can be
 dangerous.""
It's because you never suspect kids
, Eckert thought,
you never think
 they'll do any harm. But they can be taught. They could do as much
 damage with a knife as a man could, for instance. And they might have
 other weapons.
But the idea still didn't go with the warm sun and the blue sky and the
 piny scent of the trees.


 One of the adults of the village started to walk toward them.


 ""The reception committee,"" Templin said tightly. His hand went inside
 his tunic.


 He couldn't be blamed for being jumpy, Eckert realized. This was his
 first time out, his first mission like this. And, of course, Pendleton
 had been a pretty good friend of his.


 ""I'd be very careful what I did,"" Eckert said softly. ""I would hate to
 start something merely because I misunderstood their intentions.""


 The committee of one was a middle-aged man dressed in a simple strip of
 white cloth twisted about his waist and allowed to hang freely to his
 knees. When he got closer, Eckert became less sure of his age. He had
 the firm, tanned musculature of a much younger man, though a slightly
 seamed face and white hair aged him somewhat. Eckert still had the
 feeling that if you wanted to know his exact age, you'd have to look
 at his teeth or know something about his epiphyseal closures.


 ""You are
menshars
from Earth?"" The voice was husky and pleasant and
 the pronunciation was very clear. Eckert regarded him thoughtfully
 and made a few mental notes. He wasn't bowing and scraping like most
 natives who weren't too familiar with visitors from the sky, and yet he
 was hardly either friendly or hostile.


 ""You learned our language from Pendleton and Reynolds?"" Reynolds had
 been the anthropologist.


 ""We have had visitors from Earth before."" He hesitated a moment
 and then offered his hand, somewhat shyly, Eckert thought, in the
 Terrestrial sign of greeting. ""You may call me
Jathong
if you wish.""
 He paused a moment to say something in his native tongue to the kids
 who were around. They promptly scattered and picked up the luggage.
 ""While you are here, you will need a place to stay. There is one ready,
 if you will follow me.""


 He was polite, Eckert thought. He didn't ask what they were there
 for or how long they were going to stay. But then again, perhaps the
 natives were a better judge of that than he and Templin.


 The town was larger than he had thought at first, stretching over a
 wide expanse of the countryside. There wasn't, so far as he could see,
 much manufacturing above the level of handicrafts and simple weaving.
 Colored patches on far hillsides indicated the presence of farms, and
 practically every house in the village had its small garden.


 What manufacturing there was seemed to be carried on in the central
 square of the town, where a few adults and children squatted in the
 warm afternoon sun and worked industriously at potter's wheels and
 weaver's looms. The other part of the square was given over to the
 native bazaar where pots and bolts of cloth were for sale, and where
 numerous stalls were loaded with dried fruits and vegetables and the
 cleaned and plucked carcasses of the local variety of fowl.


 It was late afternoon when they followed Jathong into a small,
 white-washed house midway up a hill.


 ""You are free to use this while you are here,"" he said.


 Eckert and Templin took a quick tour of the few rooms. They were well
 furnished, in a rustic sort of way, and what modern conveniences they
 didn't have they could easily do without. The youngsters who had
 carried their luggage left it outside and quietly faded away. It was
 getting dark; Eckert opened one of the boxes they had brought along,
 took out an electric lantern and lighted it. He turned to Jathong.


 ""You've been very kind to us and we would like to repay you. You may
 take what you wish of anything within this box."" He opened another of
 the boxes and displayed the usual trade goods—brightly colored cloth
 and finely worked jewelry and a few mechanical contrivances that Eckert
 knew usually appealed to the primitive imagination.


 Jathong ran his hand over the cloth and held some of the jewelry up to
 the light. Eckert knew by the way he looked at it that he wasn't at all
 impressed. ""I am grateful,"" he said finally, ""but there is nothing I
 want."" He turned and walked away into the gathering darkness.


 ""The incorruptible native."" Templin laughed sarcastically.


 Eckert shrugged. ""That's one of the things you do out of habit, try
 and buy some of the natives so you'll have friends in case you need
 them."" He stopped for a moment, thinking. ""Did you notice the context?
 He didn't say he didn't want what we showed him. He said there was
nothing
that he wanted. Implying that everything he wanted, he
 already had.""


 ""That's not very typical of a primitive society, is it?""


 ""No, I'm afraid it's not."" Eckert started unpacking some of the boxes.
 ""You know, Ray, I got a kick out of the kids. They're a healthy-looking
 lot, aren't they?""


 ""Too healthy,"" Templin said. ""There didn't seem to be any sick ones or
 ones with runny noses or cuts or black eyes or bruises. It doesn't seem
 natural.""


 ""They're probably just well brought-up kids,"" Eckert said sharply.
 ""Maybe they've been taught not to get in fights or play around in the
 mud on the way home from school."" He felt faintly irritated, annoyed at
 the way Templin had put it, as if any deviation from an Earth norm was
 potentially dangerous.


 ""Ted."" Templin's voice was strained. ""This could be a trap, you know.""


 ""In what way?""


 The words came out slowly. ""The people are too casual, as though
 they're playing a rehearsed part. Here we are, from an entirely
 different solar system, landed in what must be to them an unusual
 manner. They couldn't have seen rockets more than three or four
 times before. It should still be a novelty to them. And yet how much
 curiosity did they show? Hardly any. Was there any fear? No. And the
 cute, harmless little kids."" He looked at Eckert. ""Maybe that's what
 we're supposed to think—just an idyllic, harmless society. Maybe
 that's what Pendleton thought, right to the very end.""


 He was keyed up, jumpy, Eckert realized. He would probably be seeing
 things in every shadow and imagining danger to be lurking around every
 corner.


 ""It hasn't been established yet that Pendleton was killed, Ray. Let's
 keep an open mind until we know for certain.""


 He flicked out the light and lay back on the cool bed, letting his
 body relax completely. The cool night wind blew lazily through the
 wood slat blinds, carrying the fragrance of the trees and the grass,
 and he inhaled deeply and let his thoughts wander for a moment. It was
 going to be pleasant to live on Tunpesh for six months—even if the six
 months were all they had to live. The climate was superb and the people
 seemed a cut above the usual primitive culture. If he ever retired some
 day, he thought suddenly, he would have to remember Tunpesh. It would
 be pleasant to spend his old age here. And the fishing was probably
 excellent....


 He turned his head a little to watch Templin get ready for bed. There
 were advantages in taking him along that Templin probably didn't
 even realize. He wondered what Templin would do if he ever found out
 that the actual reason he had been chosen to go was that his own
 psychological chart was very close to Pendleton's. Pendleton's own
 feelings and emotions would almost exactly be duplicated in Templin's.


 A few stray wisps of starlight pierced through the blinds and sparkled
 for an instant on a small metal box strapped to Templin's waist. A
 power pack, Eckert saw grimly, probably leading to the buttons on his
 tunic. A very convenient, portable, and hard to detect weapon.


 There were disadvantages in taking Templin, too.
""Just how primitive do you think the society is, Ted?""


 Eckert put down the chain he had been whittling and reached for his
 pipe and tobacco.


 ""I don't think it's primitive at all. There are too many disparities.
 Their knowledge of a lot of things is a little more than empirical
 knowledge; they associate the growth of crops with fertilizer and
 nitrogen in the soil as well as sunlight, rather than the blessings of
 some native god. And they differ a lot in other respects. Their art and
 their music are advanced. Free art exists along with purely decorative
 art, and their techniques are finely developed.""


 ""I'm glad you agree, then. Take a look at this."" Templin threw a shiny
 bit of metal on the rough-hewn table. Eckert picked it up and inspected
 it. It was heavy and one side of it was extremely sharp.


 ""What's it for?""


 ""They've got a hospital set up here. Not a hospital like any we know,
 of course, but a hospital nonetheless. It's not used very much;
 apparently the natives don't get sick here. But occasionally there are
 hunting accidents and injuries that require surgery. The strip of metal
 there is a scalpel."" He laughed shortly. ""Primitive little gadget, but
 it works well—as well as any of ours.""


 Eckert hefted it in his palm. ""The most important thing is that they
 have the knowledge to use it. Surgery isn't a simple science.""


 ""Well, what do you think about it?""


 ""The obvious. They evidently have as much technology as they want, at
 least in fields where they have to have it.""


 ""How come they haven't gone any further?""


 ""Why should they? You can live without skycars and rocket ships, you
 know.""


 ""Did you ever wonder what kind of weapons they might have?""


 ""The important thing,"" Eckert mused, ""is not if they have them, but if
 they'd use them. And I rather doubt that they would. We've been here
 for two weeks now and they've been very kind to us, seeing that we've
 had food and water and what fuel we need.""


 ""It's known in the livestock trade as being fattened up for the
 slaughter,"" Templeton said.


 Eckert sighed and watched a fat bug waddle across a small patch of
 sunlight on the wooden floor. It was bad enough drawing an assignment
 in a totally foreign culture, even if the natives were humanoid. It
 complicated things beyond all measure when your partner in the project
 seemed likely to turn into a vendettist. It meant that Eckert would
 have to split his energies. He'd have to do what investigating he could
 among the Tunpeshans, and he'd have to watch Templin to see that he
 didn't go off half-cocked and spoil everything.


 ""You're convinced that Pendleton was murdered, aren't you?""


 Templin nodded. ""Sure.""


 ""Why?""


 ""The Tunpeshans know why we're here. We've dropped enough hints along
 those lines. But nobody has mentioned Pendleton; nobody has volunteered
 any information about him. And he was an attache here for three
 years. Didn't anybody know him during that time? We've let slip a few
 discreet statements that we would like to talk to Pendleton's friends,
 yet nobody's come around. Apparently, in all the three years he was
 here, Pendleton didn't make any friends. And that's a little hard to
 believe. It's more likely that his friends have been silenced and any
 information about him is being withheld for a reason.""


 ""What reason?""


 Templin shrugged. ""Murder. What other reason could there be?""


 Eckert rolled up the thin, slatted blinds and stared out at the
 scenery. A hundred feet down the road, a native woman was going to
 market, leading a species of food animal by the halter.


 ""They grow their women nice, don't they?""


 ""Physically perfect, like the men,"" Templin grumbled. ""You could get an
 inferiority complex just from watching the people here. Everybody's so
 damn perfect. Nobody's sick, nobody's unhealthy, nobody is too fat or
 too thin, nobody's unhappy. The only variation is that they don't all
 look alike. Perfection. It gets boring after a while.""


 ""Does it? I hadn't noticed."" Eckert turned away from the blinds. His
 voice was crisp. ""I knew Don Pendleton quite well, too,"" he said. ""But
 it isn't blinding me to what I'm here for. We came to find out what
 happened to him, not to substantiate any preconceived notions. What
 we find out may be vitally important to anybody serving here in the
 future. I would hate to see our efforts spoiled because you've already
 made up your mind.""


 ""You knew Pendleton,"" Templin repeated grimly. ""Do you think it was
 suicide?""


 ""I don't think there's such a thing as a suicide type, when you come
 down to it. I'm not ruling out the possibility of murder, either. I'm
 trying to keep an open mind.""


 ""What have we accomplished so far? What have we found out?""


 ""We've got six months,"" Eckert said quietly. ""Six months in which
 we'll try to live here inconspicuously and study the people and try to
 cultivate informants. We would get nowhere if we came barging in asking
 all sorts of questions. And don't forget, Ray, we're all alone on
 Tunpesh. If it is a case of murder, what happens when the natives find
 out that we know it is?""


 Templin's eyes dueled for a moment. Then he turned his back and walked
 to the window. ""I suppose you're right,"" he said at last. ""It's nice
 living here, Ted. Maybe I've been fighting it. But I can't help
 thinking that Don must have liked it here, too.""
One of the hardest things to learn in a foreign culture, Eckert
 thought, is when to enjoy yourself, when to work and when to worry.


 ""
Pelache, menshar?
""


 ""
Sharra!
"" He took the small bowl of
pelache
nuts, helped himself
 to a few, and passed the bowl on. This was definitely the time to
 enjoy himself, not to work or worry. He had heard about the
halera
a
 few days ago, and, by judicious hinting to the proper authorities, he
 and Templin had been invited. It was a good chance to observe native
 customs. A little anthropology—with refreshments.


 The main courses started making the rounds and he took generous
 helpings of the roasted
ulami
and the broiled
halunch
and numerous
 dabs from the side dishes of steaming vegetables. Between every course,
 they passed around a small flagon of the hot, spiced native wine, but
 he noticed that nobody drank to excess.
The old Greek ideal
, he thought:
moderation in everything.
He looked at Templin, sitting across from him in the huge circle, and
 shrugged mentally. Templin looked as if he was about to break down and
 enjoy himself, but there was still a slight bulge under his tunic,
 where he had strapped his power pack. Any fool should have known that
 nothing would happen at a banquet like this. The only actual danger lay
 in Templin's getting excited and doing something he was bound to regret
 later on. And even that danger was not quite as likely now.
There will be hell to pay
, Eckert thought,
if Templin ever finds out
 that I sabotaged his power pack.
""You look thoughtful,
menshar
Eckert.""


 Eckert took another sip of the wine and turned to the Tunpeshan on his
 left. He was a tall, muscular man with sharp eyes, a firm chin and a
 certain aura of authority.


 ""I was wondering if my countryman Pendleton had offended your people in
 any way, Nayova."" Now was as good a time as any to pump him for what he
 knew about Pendleton's death.


 ""So far as I know,
menshar
Pendleton offended no one. I do not know
 what duties he had to perform here, but he was a generous and courteous
 man.""


 Eckert gnawed the dainty meat off a slender
ulami
bone and tried to
 appear casual in his questioning.


 ""I am sure he was, Nayova. I am sure, too, that you were as kind to him
 as you have been to Templin and myself. My Government is grateful to
 you for that.""


 Nayova seemed pleased. ""We tried to do as well for
menshar
Pendleton
 as we could. While he was here, he had the house that you have now and
 we saw that he was supplied with food and all other necessities.""


 Eckert had a sudden clammy feeling which quickly passed away. What
 Nayova had said was something he'd make sure Templin never heard about.
 He wiped his mouth on a broad, flat leaf that had been provided and
 took another sip of the wine.


 ""We were shocked to find out that
menshar
Pendleton had killed
 himself. We knew him quite well and we could not bring ourselves to
 believe he had done such a thing.""


 Nayova's gaze slid away from him. ""Perhaps it was the will of the Great
 One,"" he said vaguely. He didn't seem anxious to talk about it.


 Eckert stared bleakly at his wine glass and tried to put the pieces of
 information together. They probably had a taboo about self-destruction
 which would make it difficult to talk about. That would make it even
 harder for him to find out by direct questioning.


 A native fife trilled shrilly and a group of young men and women walked
 into the room. The circle broke to let them through and they came and
 knelt before Nayova. When he clapped his hands sharply, they retreated
 to the center of the circle and began the slow motions of a native
 dance.
The sound of the fife softened and died and the slow monotonous beat of
 drums took its place. The beat slowly increased and so did the rhythm
 of the dancers. The small fires at the corners of the hut were allowed
 to dwindle and the center of the circle became filled with the motions
 of shadows intermixed with the swift, sure movements of glistening
 limbs. Eckert felt his eyebrows crawl upward. Apparently the dance was
 the Tunpeshan version of the
rites de passage
. He glanced across
 the circle at Templin. Templin's face—what he could see of it by the
 flickering light—was brick red.


 A voice spoke in his ear. ""It is hard for us to imagine anybody doing
 what
menshar
Pendleton did. It is ..."" and he used a native word that
 Eckert translated as being roughly equivalent to ""
obscene
.""


 The dancers at the center of the circle finally bowed out with small
 garlands of flowers on their heads that signified their reaching
 adulthood. Acrobats then took the stage and went through a dizzying
 routine, and they in turn were succeeded by a native singer.


 They were all excellent, Eckert thought. If anything, they were too
 good.


 The bowl of
pelache
nuts made its way around again and Nayova leaned
 over to speak to him. ""If there is any possibility that I can help you
 while you are here,
menshar
Eckert, you have but to ask.""


 It would probably be a mistake to ask for a list of Pendleton's
 friends, but there was a way around that. ""I would like to meet any
 of your people who had dealings with Pendleton, either in business or
 socially. I will do everything not to inconvenience them in any way.""


 ""I think they would be glad to help you. I shall ask them to go to you
 this coming week.""

         Like all superheroes worthy of the title, the Shopping Avenger has an Achilles' heel. In the case of the Shopping Avenger, his Achilles' heel is not animal, vegetable, or mineral but something less tangible. 

         An explanation: Last week, the magazine you are currently reading forced the Shopping Avenger at gunpoint to read a series of treacle-filled self-help books, and then to . The Shopping Avenger, who can withstand radiation, extreme heat and cold, hail, bear attacks, and Eyes Wide Shut , almost succumbed to terminal jejuneness after reading these books. Except for one thing: One of the books, The Art of Happiness , which collects and simplifies the Dalai Lama's philosophy, got the Shopping Avenger to thinking. This, in a way, is the Shopping Avenger's Achilles' heel: thinking. Perhaps it is wrong, the Shopping Avenger thought, to complain about the petty insults and inconveniences of life in the materialistic '90s. The Shopping Avenger felt that perhaps he should counsel those who write seeking help to meditate, to accept bad service the way one accepts the change of seasons, and to extend a compassionate hand of forgiveness to those who provide poor customer care. 

         But then the Shopping Avenger sat down, and the feeling passed. 

         The Shopping Avenger does not make light of the Dalai Lama or of the notion that there is more to life than the impatient acquisition of material goods. If the Shopping Avenger were not, for a superhero, extremely nonjudgmental--as opposed to his alter ego, who is considered insufferably judgmental by his alter ego's wife--the Shopping Avenger would tell the occasional correspondent to let go of his petty grievance and get a life. 

         But the Shopping Avenger also believes that the Dalai Lama has never tried to rent a truck from U-Haul. If he had tried to rent from U-Haul, he never would have escaped from Tibet. (For the complete back story, see ""Shopping Avenger"" column and one.) 

         The complaints about U-Haul's nonreservation reservation policy continue to pour in through the electronic mail. One correspondent, B.R., wrote in with this cautionary tale: ""Last weekend, I went to San Francisco to help my brother and his family move into their first house. My brother had reserved a moving truck with U-Haul for the big day. I warned my brother about U-Haul's 'not really a reservation per se' policy that I learned from the Shopping Avenger. He didn't believe such a thing would happen to him, so he didn't act on my warning."" 

         B.R. continues--as if you don't know what happened already--""I went to U-Haul with my brother to get our 'reserved' truck. The store had many customers standing around looking frustrated. When we got to the front of the line, the clerk informed us that our 'reserved' truck had not yet been returned. We asked if we could rent one of the many trucks sitting idle in the parking lot. The clerk laughed and said the keys to those trucks were lost."" 

         B.R. and his chastened brother--the Shopping Avenger is resisting the urge to gloat--went to Ryder. ""Ryder had a truck available for us. The gentleman who helped us at Ryder said Ryder prides itself on being everything U-Haul is not."" 

         The Shopping Avenger has still not received a call from U-Haul spokeswoman Johna Burke explaining why U-Haul refuses to provide trucks to people who reserve trucks, but the Shopping Avenger is pleased to note that several correspondents have written in over the past month saying that, based on what they have read in this column, they will be taking their business to Ryder or Budget or elsewhere. 

         The Shopping Avenger will undoubtedly return to the sorry state of affairs at U-Haul in the next episode, but now on to this month's airline debacle. 

         Before we begin, though, the Shopping Avenger nearly forgot to announce the winner of last month's contest, in which readers were asked to answer the question, ""What's the difference between pests and airlines?"" 

         The winner is one Tom Morgan, who wrote, ""You can hire someone to kill pests."" Tom is the winner of a year's supply of Turtle Wax, and he will receive his prize just as soon as the Shopping Avenger figures out how much Turtle Wax actually constitutes a year's supply. The new contest question: How much Turtle Wax comprises a year's supply of Turtle Wax? 

         This month's airline in the spotlight is Southwest. Loyal readers will recall that last month the Shopping Avenger praised Southwest Airlines for its ""sterling"" customer service. This brought forth a small number of articulate dissensions. The most articulate, and the most troubling, came from M., who wrote, ""Last year, flying from Baltimore to Chicago with my entire family (two really little kids included), we set down at Midway in a rainstorm. And waited for our bags. And waited for bags. And waited for bags."" 

         An hour later, M. says, the bags showed up, ""soaked through. We took them to baggage services at SW and were faced with the most complicated, unclear, and confusing mechanism for filing a claim we experienced flyers have ever seen."" 

         When they arrived at their destination, M. and her family made a terrible discovery, ""We discovered that our clothes were soaked through--the top clothes were so wet that the dye had bled through down to the lower levels, destroying lots of other clothes. Obviously, our bags had just been sitting out on the runway in the rain. To this day, I've never heard a thing from SW, despite calls and letters."" 

         This, of course, is where Shopping Avenger steps in. Shopping Avenger knows that Southwest is different from the average airline, in that it doesn't go out of its way to infuriate its paying customers (see: ), so I expected a quick and generous resolution to M.'s problem. 

         What I got at first, though, was a load of corporate hoo-ha. 

         ""The airline's policy, which is consistent with all contracts of carriage at all airlines, requires that passengers file a report in person for lost or damaged luggage within four hours of arrival at their destination,"" a Southwest spokeswoman, Linda Rutherford, e-mailed me. ""[M.] indicates she called for a few days, but did not file a report in person until April 12--three days later. Southwest, as a courtesy, took her report anyway and asked for follow up information and written inventory of the damage."" Rutherford said that M. should have submitted detailed receipts and photographs of the damage in order to make a claim. 

         Harrumph, the Shopping Avenger says. It is a bad hair day at Southwest when its officials defend themselves by comparing their airline to other airlines. I forwarded this message to M., who replied: 

         ""Wow. Well, of course I didn't file it at the airport on the 9 th because I didn't know the clothes were ruined at the airport. I didn't know until I opened the baggage at my hotel and saw the ruined stuff. (And it's worth noting that we had already waited for about an hour for our luggage with two little kids and impatient in-laws nipping at our heels.)"" 

         She goes on, ""I did call that evening ... and was told that that sufficed. This is the first time I've been told that I had to file a complaint in person within four hours. ... When I filed on the 12 th , I was never told that I needed any receipts or photos or other type of documentation. The baggage folks seemed pretty uninterested in all of this. ... They know that the type of 'evidence' they want is impossible to obtain. They also know that on April 9 they screwed up the luggage retrieval and left bags out in the rain a long time."" 

         Southwest's response actually served to anger M. more than the original problem. ""Before, they had a mildly annoyed but loyal customer (who would have been placated by an apology and thrilled with some modest token of their regret). Now they have a pissed-off customer."" 

         Things do look bad for Southwest, don't they? The Shopping Avenger sent M.'s response to Rutherford, who e-mailed back saying she thought the Shopping Avenger was asking for ""policy information."" The Shopping Avenger e-mailed back again, stressing to Rutherford that the Great Court of Consumer Justice would, if this case were brought to trial, undoubtedly find for the plaintiff (the Shopping Avenger serves as prosecutor, judge, and jury in the Great Court of Consumer Justice--defendants are represented by the president of U-Haul), and that Southwest was precipitously close to feeling the sword of retribution at its neck. 

         But then she came through, provisionally, ""Yep, you can be sure if [M.] will call me we will get everything squared away. I'm sorry it's taken this long for her to get someone who can help, but we will take care of it from here."" 

         Stay tuned, shoppers, to hear whether Southwest makes good it promise to compensate M. and apologize to her for her troubles. 

         The story of M. reminds the Shopping Avenger of a central truth of consumer service: It's not the crime, it's the cover-up. 

         Take the case of K., who found himself waiting in vain for Circuit City to repair his television. Televisions break, even 1-year-old televisions, as is the case with K's. But Circuit City, where he bought the television, gave him a terrible runaround. The Shopping Avenger dispatched his sidekick, Tad the Deputy Avenger, to get to the bottom of K.'s story. This is what he found: K. grew concerned, Tad the Deputy Avenger reports, after his television had been in the Circuit City shop for a week. When he called, he was told to ""check back next week."" When he asked if someone from the store could call him with more information, he was refused. Weeks went by. When K. told one Circuit City employee that he really would like to get his television back, the employee, K. says, asked him, ""Don't you have another television in your house?"" 

         More than a month later--after hours and hours and hours of telephone calls and days missed at work--K. received his television back. 

         Mistakes happen, but not, Tad the Deputy Avenger found out, at Circuit City. The case, K. was told by a Circuit City official, was ""handled perfectly."" Another official, Morgan Stewart in public relations, assured Deputy Avenger Tad that ""We got to be a big and successful company by treating customers better than the other guy."" The Shopping Avenger and his loyal sidekick would like to hear from other Circuit City customers: Does Circuit City, in fact, treat its customers better than the other guy? 

         Stay tuned for answers. And next month, a Shopping Avenger clergy special: TWA screws with a Hasidic rabbi's travel plans, leaving the rabbi's wife crying at the airport. Find out if the Shopping Avenger can save TWA from certain heavenly punishment, in the next episode.

The Cosmic Express
By JACK WILLIAMSON
Introduction by Sam Moskowitz
The
year 1928 was a great
 year of discovery for
AMAZING
 STORIES
 .
They were uncovering
 new talent at such a great rate,
 (Harl Vincent, David H. Keller,
 E. E. Smith, Philip Francis Nowlan,
 Fletcher Pratt and Miles J.
 Breuer), that Jack Williamson
 barely managed to become one of
 a distinguished group of discoveries
 by stealing the cover of the
 December issue for his first story
The Metal Man.
A disciple of A. Merritt, he attempted
 to imitate in style, mood
 and subject the magic of that
 late lamented master of fantasy.
 The imitation found great favor
 from the readership and almost
 instantly Jack Williamson became
 an important name on the
 contents page of
AMAZING STORIES
 .
He followed his initial success
 with two short novels
, The
 Green Girl
in
AMAZING STORIES
and
The Alien Intelligence
in
SCIENCE WONDER STORIES
 ,
another
 Gernsback publication. Both of
 these stories were close copies of
 A. Merritt, whose style and method
 Jack Williamson parlayed into
 popularity for eight years.
Yet the strange thing about it
 was that Jack Williamson was
 one of the most versatile science
 fiction authors ever to sit down
 at the typewriter. When the
 vogue for science-fantasy altered
 to super science, he created the
 memorable super lock-picker
 Giles Habilula as the major attraction
 in a rousing trio of space
 operas
, The Legion of Space, The
 Cometeers
and
One Against the
 Legion.
When grim realism was
 the order of the day, he produced
Crucible of Power
and when they
 wanted extrapolated theory in
 present tense, he assumed the
 disguise of Will Stewart and
 popularized the concept of contra
 terrene matter in science fiction
 with
Seetee Ship
and
Seetee
 Shock.
Finally, when only psychological
 studies of the future
 would do, he produced
""With
 Folded Hands ..."" ""... And
 Searching Mind.""


 The Cosmic Express
is of special
 interest because it was written
 during Williamson's A. Merritt
 ""kick,"" when he was writing
 little else but, and it gave the
 earliest indication of a more general
 capability. The lightness of
 the handling is especially modern,
 barely avoiding the farcical
 by the validity of the notion that
 wireless transmission of matter
 is the next big transportation
 frontier to be conquered. It is
 especially important because it
 stylistically forecast a later trend
 to accept the background for
 granted, regardless of the quantity
 of wonders, and proceed with
 the story. With only a few thousand
 scanning-disk television sets
 in existence at the time of the
 writing, the surmise that this
 media would be a natural for
 westerns was particularly astute.
Jack Williamson was born in
 1908 in the Arizona territory
 when covered wagons were the
 primary form of transportation
 and apaches still raided the settlers.
 His father was a cattle
 man, but for young Jack, the
 ranch was anything but glamorous.
 ""My days were filled,"" he remembers,
 ""with monotonous
 rounds of what seemed an endless,
 heart-breaking war with
 drought and frost and dust-storms,
 poison-weeds and hail,
 for the sake of survival on the
Llano Estacado.""
The discovery
 of
AMAZING STORIES
was the escape
 he sought and his goal was
 to be a science fiction writer. He
 labored to this end and the first
 he knew that a story of his had
 been accepted was when he
 bought the December, 1929 issue
 of
AMAZING STORIES
 .
Since then,
 he has written millions of words
 of science fiction and has gone on
 record as follows: ""I feel that
 science-fiction is the folklore of
 the new world of science, and
 the expression of man's reaction
 to a technological environment.
 By which I mean that it is the
 most interesting and stimulating
 form of literature today.""
Mr. Eric Stokes-Harding
 tumbled out of the
 rumpled bed-clothing, a striking
 slender figure in purple-striped
 pajamas. He smiled fondly across
 to the other of the twin beds,
 where Nada, his pretty bride,
 lay quiet beneath light silk covers.
 With a groan, he stood up
 and began a series of fantastic
 bending exercises. But after a
 few half-hearted movements, he
 gave it up, and walked through
 an open door into a small bright
 room, its walls covered with bookcases
 and also with scientific appliances
 that would have been
 strange to the man of four or
 five centuries before, when the
 Age of Aviation was beginning.
Suddenly there was a sharp tingling
 sensation where they touched
 the polished surface.
Yawning, Mr. Eric Stokes-Harding
 stood before the great
 open window, staring out. Below
 him was a wide, park-like space,
 green with emerald lawns, and
 bright with flowering plants.
 Two hundred yards across it rose
 an immense pyramidal building—an
 artistic structure, gleaming
 with white marble and bright
 metal, striped with the verdure
 of terraced roof-gardens,
 its slender peak rising to
 help support the gray, steel-ribbed
 glass roof above. Beyond,
 the park stretched away in
 illimitable vistas, broken with
 the graceful columned buildings
 that held up the great glass roof.


 Above the glass, over this New
 York of 2432 A. D., a freezing
 blizzard was sweeping. But small
 concern was that to the lightly
 clad man at the window, who was
 inhaling deeply the fragrant air
 from the plants below—air kept,
 winter and summer, exactly at
 20° C.


 With another yawn, Mr. Eric
 Stokes-Harding turned back to
 the room, which was bright with
 the rich golden light that poured
 in from the suspended globes of
 the cold ato-light that illuminated
 the snow-covered city.
 With a distasteful grimace, he
 seated himself before a broad,
 paper-littered desk, sat a few
 minutes leaning back, with his
 hands clasped behind his head.
 At last he straightened reluctantly,
 slid a small typewriter
 out of its drawer, and began
 pecking at it impatiently.


 For Mr. Eric Stokes-Harding
 was an author. There was a whole
 shelf of his books on the wall, in
 bright jackets, red and blue and
 green, that brought a thrill of
 pleasure to the young novelist's
 heart when he looked up from his
 clattering machine.


 He wrote ""thrilling action romances,""
 as his enthusiastic publishers
 and television directors
 said, ""of ages past, when men
 were men. Red-blooded heroes responding
 vigorously to the stirring
 passions of primordial life!""
He
 was impartial as to the
 source of his thrills—provided
 they were distant enough
 from modern civilization. His
 hero was likely to be an ape-man
 roaring through the jungle, with
 a bloody rock in one hand and
 a beautiful girl in the other.
 Or a cowboy, ""hard-riding, hard-shooting,""
 the vanishing hero of
 the ancient ranches. Or a man
 marooned with a lovely woman
 on a desert South Sea island.
 His heroes were invariably
 strong, fearless, resourceful fellows,
 who could handle a club on
 equal terms with a cave-man, or
 call science to aid them in defending
 a beautiful mate from
 the terrors of a desolate wilderness.


 And a hundred million read
 Eric's novels, and watched the
 dramatization of them on the
 television screens. They thrilled
 at the simple, romantic lives his
 heroes led, paid him handsome
 royalties, and subconsciously
 shared his opinion that civilization
 had taken all the best from
 the life of man.


 Eric had settled down to the
 artistic satisfaction of describing
 the sensuous delight of his
 hero in the roasted marrow-bones
 of a dead mammoth, when
 the pretty woman in the other
 room stirred, and presently came
 tripping into the study, gay and
 vivacious, and—as her husband
 of a few months most justly
 thought—altogether beautiful in
 a bright silk dressing gown.


 Recklessly, he slammed the
 machine back into its place, and
 resolved to forget that his next
 ""red-blooded action thriller"" was
 due in the publisher's office at the
 end of the month. He sprang up
 to kiss his wife, held her embraced
 for a long happy moment.
 And then they went hand in
 hand, to the side of the room and
 punched a series of buttons on a
 panel—a simple way of ordering
 breakfast sent up the automatic
 shaft from the kitchens below.


 Nada Stokes-Harding was also
 an author. She wrote poems—""back
 to nature stuff""—simple
 lyrics of the sea, of sunsets, of
 bird songs, of bright flowers and
 warm winds, of thrilling communion
 with Nature, and growing
 things. Men read her poems
 and called her a genius. Even
 though the whole world had
 grown up into a city, the birds
 were extinct, there were no wild
 flowers, and no one had time to
 bother about sunsets.


 ""Eric, darling,"" she said, ""isn't
 it terrible to be cooped up here
 in this little flat, away from the
 things we both love?""


 ""Yes, dear. Civilization has
 ruined the world. If we could only
 have lived a thousand years ago,
 when life was simple and natural,
 when men hunted and killed their
 meat, instead of drinking synthetic
 stuff, when men still had
 the joys of conflict, instead of
 living under glass, like hot-house
 flowers.""


 ""If we could only go somewhere—""


 ""There isn't anywhere to go. I
 write about the West, Africa,
 South Sea Islands. But they
 were all filled up two hundred
 years ago. Pleasure resorts, sanatoriums,
 cities, factories.""


 ""If only we lived on Venus!
 I was listening to a lecture on
 the television, last night. The
 speaker said that the Planet
 Venus is younger than the Earth,
 that it has not cooled so much. It
 has a thick, cloudy atmosphere,
 and low, rainy forests. There's
 simple, elemental life there—like
 Earth had before civilization
 ruined it.""


 ""Yes, Kinsley, with his new infra-red
 ray telescope, that penetrates
 the cloud layers of the
 planet, proved that Venus rotates
 in about the same period as
 Earth; and it must be much like
 Earth was a million years ago.""


 ""Eric, I wonder if we could go
 there! It would be so thrilling to
 begin life like the characters in
 your stories, to get away from
 this hateful civilization, and live
 natural lives. Maybe a rocket—""
The
 young author's eyes were
 glowing. He skipped across the
 floor, seized Nada, kissed her
 ecstatically. ""Splendid! Think of
 hunting in the virgin forest, and
 bringing the game home to you!
 But I'm afraid there is no way.—Wait!
 The Cosmic Express.""


 ""The Cosmic Express?""


 ""A new invention. Just perfected
 a few weeks ago, I understand.
 By Ludwig Von der Valls,
 the German physicist.""


 ""I've quit bothering about science.
 It has ruined nature, filled
 the world with silly, artificial
 people, doing silly, artificial
 things.""


 ""But this is quite remarkable,
 dear. A new way to travel—by
 ether!""


 ""By ether!""


 ""Yes. You know of course that
 energy and matter are interchangeable
 terms; both are simply
 etheric vibration, of different
 sorts.""


 ""Of course. That's elementary.""
 She smiled proudly. ""I can
 give you examples, even of the
 change. The disintegration of the
 radium atom, making helium
 and lead and
energy
. And Millikan's
 old proof that his Cosmic
 Ray is generated when particles
 of electricity are united to form
 an atom.""


 ""Fine! I thought you said you
 weren't a scientist."" He glowed
 with pride. ""But the method, in
 the new Cosmic Express, is simply
 to convert the matter to be
 carried into power, send it out
 as a radiant beam and focus the
 beam to convert it back into
 atoms at the destination.""


 ""But the amount of energy
 must be terrific—""


 ""It is. You know short waves
 carry more energy than long
 ones. The Express Ray is an
 electromagnetic vibration of frequency
 far higher than that of
 even the Cosmic Ray, and correspondingly
 more powerful and
 more penetrating.""


 The girl frowned, running slim
 fingers through golden-brown
 hair. ""But I don't see how they
 get any recognizable object, not
 even how they get the radiation
 turned back into matter.""


 ""The beam is focused, just like
 the light that passes through a
 camera lens. The photographic
 lens, using light rays, picks up a
 picture and reproduces it again
 on the plate—just the same as
 the Express Ray picks up an
 object and sets it down on the
 other side of the world.


 ""An analogy from television
 might help. You know that by
 means of the scanning disc, the
 picture is transformed into mere
 rapid fluctuations in the brightness
 of a beam of light. In a
 parallel manner, the focal plane
 of the Express Ray moves slowly
 through the object, progressively,
 dissolving layers of the
 thickness of a single atom, which
 are accurately reproduced at the
 other focus of the instrument—which
 might be in Venus!


 ""But the analogy of the lens
 is the better of the two. For no
 receiving instrument is required,
 as in television. The object is
 built up of an infinite series of
 plane layers, at the focus of the
 ray, no matter where that may
 be. Such a thing would be impossible
 with radio apparatus
 because even with the best beam
 transmission, all but a tiny fraction
 of the power is lost, and
 power is required to rebuild the
 atoms. Do you understand,
 dear?""


 ""Not altogether. But I should
 worry! Here comes breakfast.
 Let me butter your toast.""


 A bell had rung at the shaft.
 She ran to it, and returned with
 a great silver tray, laden with
 dainty dishes, which she set on a
 little side table. They sat down
 opposite each other, and ate, getting
 as much satisfaction from
 contemplation of each other's
 faces as from the excellent food.
 When they had finished, she carried
 the tray to the shaft, slid
 it in a slot, and touched a button—thus
 disposing of the culinary
 cares of the morning.


 She ran back to Eric, who was
 once more staring distastefully
 at his typewriter.


 ""Oh, darling! I'm thrilled to
 death about the Cosmic Express!
 If we could go to Venus, to a new
 life on a new world, and get
 away from all this hateful conventional
 society—""


 ""We can go to their office—it's
 only five minutes. The chap
 that operates the machine for
 the company is a pal of mine.
 He's not supposed to take passengers
 except between the offices
 they have scattered about the
 world. But I know his weak
 point—""


 Eric laughed, fumbled with a
 hidden spring under his desk. A
 small polished object, gleaming
 silvery, slid down into his hand.


 ""Old friendship,
plus
this,
 would make him—like spinach.""
Five
 minutes later Mr. Eric
 Stokes-Harding and his pretty
 wife were in street clothes,
 light silk tunics of loose, flowing
 lines—little clothing being required
 in the artificially warmed
 city. They entered an elevator
 and dropped thirty stories to the
 ground floor of the great building.


 There they entered a cylindrical
 car, with rows of seats down
 the sides. Not greatly different
 from an ancient subway car, except
 that it was air-tight, and
 was hurled by magnetic attraction
 and repulsion through a
 tube exhausted of air, at a speed
 that would have made an old
 subway rider gasp with amazement.


 In five more minutes their car
 had whipped up to the base of
 another building, in the business
 section, where there was no room
 for parks between the mighty
 structures that held the unbroken
 glass roofs two hundred stories
 above the concrete pavement.


 An elevator brought them up a
 hundred and fifty stories. Eric
 led Nada down a long, carpeted
 corridor to a wide glass door,
 which bore the words:
COSMIC EXPRESS
stenciled in gold capitals across
 it.


 As they approached, a lean
 man, carrying a black bag, darted
 out of an elevator shaft opposite
 the door, ran across the corridor,
 and entered. They pushed in after
 him.


 They were in a little room,
 cut in two by a high brass grill.
 In front of it was a long bench
 against the wall, that reminded
 one of the waiting room in an old
 railroad depot. In the grill was a
 little window, with a lazy, brown-eyed
 youth leaning on the shelf
 behind it. Beyond him was a
 great, glittering piece of mechanism,
 half hidden by the brass.
 A little door gave access to the
 machine from the space before
 the grill.


 The thin man in black, whom
 Eric now recognized as a prominent
 French heart-specialist, was
 dancing before the window, waving
 his bag frantically, raving at
 the sleepy boy.


 ""Queek! I have tell you zee
 truth! I have zee most urgent
 necessity to go queekly. A patient
 I have in Paree, zat ees in
 zee most creetical condition!""


 ""Hold your horses just a minute,
 Mister. We got a client in
 the machine now. Russian diplomat
 from Moscow to Rio de
 Janeiro.... Two hundred seventy
 dollars and eighty cents,
 please.... Your turn next. Remember
 this is just an experimental
 service. Regular installations
 all over the world in a year....
 Ready now. Come on in.""


 The youth took the money,
 pressed a button. The door
 sprang open in the grill, and the
 frantic physician leaped through
 it.


 ""Lie down on the crystal, face
 up,"" the young man ordered.
 ""Hands at your sides, don't
 breathe. Ready!""


 He manipulated his dials and
 switches, and pressed another
 button.


 ""Why, hello, Eric, old man!""
 he cried. ""That's the lady you
 were telling me about? Congratulations!""
 A bell jangled before
 him on the panel. ""Just a minute.
 I've got a call.""


 He punched the board again.
 Little bulbs lit and glowed for a
 second. The youth turned toward
 the half-hidden machine, spoke
 courteously.


 ""All right, madam. Walk out.
 Hope you found the transit pleasant.""


 ""But my Violet! My precious
 Violet!"" a shrill female voice
 came from the machine. ""Sir,
 what have you done with my
 darling Violet?""


 ""I'm sure I don't know, madam.
 You lost it off your hat?""


 ""None of your impertinence,
 sir! I want my dog.""


 ""Ah, a dog. Must have jumped
 off the crystal. You can have
 him sent on for three hundred
 and—""


 ""Young man, if any harm
 comes to my Violet—I'll—I'll—I'll
 appeal to the Society for the
 Prevention of Cruelty to Animals!""


 ""Very good, madam. We appreciate
 your patronage.""
The
 door flew open again.
 A very fat woman, puffing
 angrily, face highly colored,
 clothing shimmering with artificial
 gems, waddled pompously
 out of the door through which
 the frantic French doctor had
 so recently vanished. She rolled
 heavily across the room, and out
 into the corridor. Shrill words
 floated back:


 ""I'm going to see my lawyer!
 My precious Violet—""


 The sallow youth winked.
 ""And now what can I do for you,
 Eric?""


 ""We want to go to Venus, if
 that ray of yours can put us
 there.""


 ""To Venus? Impossible. My
 orders are to use the Express
 merely between the sixteen designated
 stations, at New York,
 San Francisco, Tokyo, London,
 Paris—""


 ""See here, Charley,"" with a
 cautious glance toward the door,
 Eric held up the silver flask.
 ""For old time's sake, and for
 this—""


 The boy seemed dazed at sight
 of the bright flask. Then, with a
 single swift motion, he snatched
 it out of Eric's hand, and bent
 to conceal it below his instrument
 panel.


 ""Sure, old boy. I'd send you to
 heaven for that, if you'd give me
 the micrometer readings to set
 the ray with. But I tell you, this
 is dangerous. I've got a sort of
 television attachment, for focusing
 the ray. I can turn that on
 Venus—I've been amusing myself,
 watching the life there, already.
 Terrible place. Savage. I
 can pick a place on high land to
 set you down. But I can't be responsible
 for what happens afterward.""


 ""Simple, primitive life is what
 we're looking for. And now what
 do I owe you—""


 ""Oh, that's all right. Between
 friends. Provided that stuff's
 genuine! Walk in and lie down on
 the crystal block. Hands at your
 sides. Don't move.""


 The little door had swung
 open again, and Eric led Nada
 through. They stepped into a little
 cell, completely surrounded
 with mirrors and vast prisms
 and lenses and electron tubes. In
 the center was a slab of transparent
 crystal, eight feet square
 and two inches thick, with an
 intricate mass of machinery below
 it.


 Eric helped Nada to a place
 on the crystal, lay down at her
 side.


 ""I think the Express Ray is
 focused just at the surface of the
 crystal, from below,"" he said. ""It
 dissolves our substance, to be
 transmitted by the beam. It
 would look as if we were melting
 into the crystal.""


 ""Ready,"" called the youth.
 ""Think I've got it for you. Sort
 of a high island in the jungle.
 Nothing bad in sight now. But,
 I say—how're you coming back?
 I haven't got time to watch you.""


 ""Go ahead. We aren't coming
 back.""


 ""Gee! What is it? Elopement?
 I thought you were married already.
 Or is it business difficulties?
 The Bears did make an awful
 raid last night. But you better
 let me set you down in Hong
 Kong.""


 A bell jangled. ""So long,"" the
 youth called.


 Nada and Eric felt themselves
 enveloped in fire. Sheets of white
 flame seemed to lap up about
 them from the crystal block. Suddenly
 there was a sharp tingling
 sensation where they touched
 the polished surface. Then blackness,
 blankness.
The
 next thing they knew, the
 fires were gone from about
 them. They were lying in something
 extremely soft and fluid;
 and warm rain was beating in
 their faces. Eric sat up, found
 himself in a mud-puddle. Beside
 him was Nada, opening her eyes
 and struggling up, her bright
 garments stained with black
 mud.


 All about rose a thick jungle,
 dark and gloomy—and very wet.
 Palm-like, the gigantic trees
 were, or fern-like, flinging clouds
 of feathery green foliage high
 against a somber sky of unbroken
 gloom.


 They stood up, triumphant.


 ""At last!"" Nada cried. ""We're
 free! Free of that hateful old
 civilization! We're back to Nature!""


 ""Yes, we're on our feet now,
 not parasites on the machines.""


 ""It's wonderful to have a fine,
 strong man like you to trust in,
 Eric. You're just like one of the
 heroes in your books!""


 ""You're the perfect companion,
 Nada.... But now we
 must be practical. We must
 build a fire, find weapons, set up
 a shelter of some kind. I guess it
 will be night, pretty soon. And
 Charley said something about
 savage animals he had seen in
 the television.


 ""We'll find a nice dry cave,
 and have a fire in front of the
 door. And skins of animals to
 sleep on. And pottery vessels to
 cook in. And you will find seeds
 and grown grain.""


 ""But first we must find a flint-bed.
 We need flint for tools, and
 to strike sparks to make a fire
 with. We will probably come
 across a chunk of virgin copper,
 too—it's found native.""


 Presently they set off through
 the jungle. The mud seemed to
 be very abundant, and of a most
 sticky consistence. They sank
 into it ankle deep at every step,
 and vast masses of it clung to
 their feet. A mile they struggled
 on, without finding where a provident
 nature had left them even
 a single fragment of quartz, to
 say nothing of a mass of pure
 copper.


 ""A darned shame,"" Eric grumbled,
 ""to come forty million
 miles, and meet such a reception
 as this!""


 Nada stopped. ""Eric,"" she
 said, ""I'm tired. And I don't believe
 there's any rock here, anyway.
 You'll have to use wooden
 tools, sharpened in the fire.""


 ""Probably you're right. This
 soil seemed to be of alluvial origin.
 Shouldn't be surprised if
 the native rock is some hundreds
 of feet underground. Your
 idea is better.""


 ""You can make a fire by rubbing
 sticks together, can't you?""


 ""It can be done, I'm sure. I've
 never tried it, myself. We need
 some dry sticks, first.""


 They resumed the weary
 march, with a good fraction of
 the new planet adhering to their
 feet. Rain was still falling from
 the dark heavens in a steady,
 warm downpour. Dry wood
 seemed scarce as the proverbial
 hen's teeth.


 ""You didn't bring any matches,
 dear?""


 ""Matches! Of course not!
 We're going back to Nature.""


 ""I hope we get a fire pretty
 soon.""


 ""If dry wood were gold dust,
 we couldn't buy a hot dog.""


 ""Eric, that reminds me that
 I'm hungry.""


 He confessed to a few pangs of
 his own. They turned their attention
 to looking for banana
 trees, and coconut palms, but
 they did not seem to abound in
 the Venerian jungle. Even small
 animals that might have been
 slain with a broken branch had
 contrary ideas about the matter.


 At last, from sheer weariness,
 they stopped, and gathered
 branches to make a sloping shelter
 by a vast fallen tree-trunk.


 ""This will keep out the rain—maybe—""
 Eric said hopefully.
 ""And tomorrow, when it has quit
 raining—I'm sure we'll do better.""


 They crept in, as gloomy night
 fell without. They lay in each
 other's arms, the body warmth
 oddly comforting. Nada cried a
 little.


 ""Buck up,"" Eric advised her.
 ""We're back to nature—where
 we've always wanted to be.""
With
 the darkness, the temperature
 fell somewhat, and
 a high wind rose, whipping cold
 rain into the little shelter, and
 threatening to demolish it.
 Swarms of mosquito-like insects,
 seemingly not inconvenienced in
 the least by the inclement elements,
 swarmed about them in
 clouds.


 Then came a sound from the
 dismal stormy night, a hoarse,
 bellowing roar, raucous, terrifying.


 Nada clung against Eric.
 ""What is it, dear?"" she chattered.


 ""Must be a reptile. Dinosaur,
 or something of the sort. This
 world seems to be in about the
 same state as the Earth when
 they flourished there.... But
 maybe it won't find us.""


 The roar was repeated, nearer.
 The earth trembled beneath a
 mighty tread.


 ""Eric,"" a thin voice trembled.
 ""Don't you think—it might have
 been better— You know the old
 life was not so bad, after all.""


 ""I was just thinking of our
 rooms, nice and warm and
 bright, with hot foods coming up
 the shaft whenever we pushed
 the button, and the gay crowds
 in the park, and my old typewriter.""


 ""Eric?"" she called softly.


 ""Yes, dear.""


 ""Don't you wish—we had
 known better?""


 ""I do."" If he winced at the
 ""we"" the girl did not notice.


 The roaring outside was closer.
 And suddenly it was answered
 by another raucous bellow, at
 considerable distance, that echoed
 strangely through the forest.
 The fearful sounds were repeated,
 alternately. And always
 the more distant seemed nearer,
 until the two sounds were together.


 And then an infernal din
 broke out in the darkness. Bellows.
 Screams. Deafening
 shrieks. Mighty splashes, as if
 struggling Titans had upset
 oceans. Thunderous crashes, as
 if they were demolishing forests.


 Eric and Nada clung to each
 other, in doubt whether to stay
 or to fly through the storm.
 Gradually the sound of the conflict
 came nearer, until the earth
 shook beneath them, and they
 were afraid to move.


 Suddenly the great fallen tree
 against which they had erected
 the flimsy shelter was rolled
 back, evidently by a chance blow
 from the invisible monsters. The
 pitiful roof collapsed on the bedraggled
 humans. Nada burst
 into tears.


 ""Oh, if only—if only—""
Suddenly
 flame lapped up
 about them, the same white
 fire they had seen as they lay on
 the crystal block. Dizziness, insensibility
 overcame them. A few
 moments later, they were lying
 on the transparent table in the
 Cosmic Express office, with all
 those great mirrors and prisms
 and lenses about them.


 A bustling, red-faced official
 appeared through the door in the
 grill, fairly bubbling apologies.


 ""So sorry—an accident—inconceivable.
 I can't see how he
 got it! We got you back as soon
 as we could find a focus. I sincerely
 hope you haven't been injured.""


 ""Why—what—what—""


 ""Why I happened in, found
 our operator drunk. I've no idea
 where he got the stuff. He muttered
 something about Venus. I
 consulted the auto-register, and
 found two more passengers registered
 here than had been recorded
 at our other stations. I
 looked up the duplicate beam coordinates,
 and found that it had
 been set on Venus. I got men on
 the television at once, and we
 happened to find you.


 ""I can't imagine how it happened.
 I've had the fellow locked
 up, and the 'dry-laws' are on the
 job. I hope you won't hold us for
 excessive damages.""


 ""No, I ask nothing except that
 you don't press charges against
 the boy. I don't want him to suffer
 for it in any way. My wife and
 I will be perfectly satisfied to get
 back to our apartment.""


 ""I don't wonder. You look like
 you've been through—I don't
 know what. But I'll have you
 there in five minutes. My private car—""
Mr. Eric Stokes-Harding, noted
 author of primitive life and love,
 ate a hearty meal with his pretty
 spouse, after they had washed
 off the grime of another planet.
 He spent the next twelve hours
 in bed.


 At the end of the month he
 delivered his promised story to
 his publishers, a thrilling tale of
 a man marooned on Venus, with
 a beautiful girl. The hero made
 stone tools, erected a dwelling
 for himself and his mate, hunted
 food for her, defended her from
 the mammoth saurian monsters
 of the Venerian jungles.


 The book was a huge success.

Certainly I see things that aren't there
 
and don't say what my voice says—but how
 
can I prove that I don't have my health?
When he began his talk with ""You got your health, don't you?"" it
 touched those spots inside me. That was when I did it.


 Why couldn't what he said have been ""The best things in life are free,
 buddy"" or ""Every dog has his day, fellow"" or ""If at first you don't
 succeed, man""? No, he had to use that one line. You wouldn't blame me.
 Not if you believe me.


 The first thing I can remember, the start of all this, was when I was
 four or five somebody was soiling my bed for me. I absolutely was not
 doing it. I took long naps morning and evening so I could lie awake all
 night to see that it wouldn't happen. It couldn't happen. But in the
 morning the bed would sit there dispassionately soiled and convict me
 on circumstantial evidence. My punishment was as sure as the tide.


 Dad was a compact man, small eyes, small mouth, tight clothes. He was
 narrow but not mean. For punishment, he locked me in a windowless
 room and told me to sit still until he came back. It wasn't so bad a
 punishment, except that when Dad closed the door, the light turned off
 and I was left there in the dark.


 Being four or five, I didn't know any better, so I thought Dad made it
 dark to add to my punishment. But I learned he didn't know the light
 went out. It came back on when he unlocked the door. Every time I told
 him about the light as soon as I could talk again, but he said I was
 lying.
One day, to prove me a liar, he opened and closed the door a few times
 from outside. The light winked off and on, off and on, always shining
 when Dad stuck his head inside. He tried using the door from the
 inside, and the light stayed on, no matter how hard he slammed the
 door.


 I stayed in the dark longer for lying about the light.


 Alone in the dark, I wouldn't have had it so bad if it wasn't for the
 things that came to me.


 They were real to me. They never touched me, but they had a little boy.
 He looked the way I did in the mirror. They did unpleasant things to
 him.


 Because they were real, I talked about them as if they were real, and
 I almost earned a bunk in the home for retarded children until I got
 smart enough to keep the beasts to myself.


 My mother hated me. I loved her, of course. I remember her smell mixed
 up with flowers and cookies and winter fires. I remember she hugged me
 on my ninth birthday. The trouble came from the notes written in my
 awkward hand that she found, calling her names I didn't understand.
 Sometimes there were drawings. I didn't write those notes or make those
 drawings.


 My mother and father must have been glad when I was sent away to reform
 school after my thirteenth birthday party, the one no one came to.


 The reform school was nicer. There were others there who'd had it about
 like me. We got along. I didn't watch their shifty eyes too much, or
 ask them what they shifted to see. They didn't talk about my screams
 at night.


 It was home.


 My trouble there was that I was always being framed for stealing. I
 didn't take any of those things they located in my bunk. Stealing
 wasn't in my line. If you believe any of this at all, you'll see why it
 couldn't be me who did the stealing.


 There was reason for me to steal, if I could have got away with it. The
 others got money from home to buy the things they needed—razor blades,
 candy, sticks of tea. I got a letter from Mom or Dad every now and then
 before they were killed, saying they had sent money or that it was
 enclosed, but somehow I never got a dime of it.


 When I was expelled from reform school, I left with just one idea in
 mind—to get all the money I could ever use for the things I needed and
 the things I wanted.
It was two or three years later that I skulked into Brother Partridge's
 mission on Durbin Street.


 The preacher and half a dozen men were singing
Onward Christian
 Soldiers
in the meeting room. It was a drafty hall with varnished
 camp chairs. I shuffled in at the back with my suitcoat collar turned
 up around my stubbled jaw. I made my hand shaky as I ran it through my
 knotted hair. Partridge was supposed to think I was just a bum. As
 an inspiration, I hugged my chest to make him think I was some wino
 nursing a flask full of Sneaky Pete. All I had there was a piece of
 copper alloy tubing inside a slice of plastic hose for taking care of
 myself, rolling sailors and the like. Who had the price of a bottle?
Partridge didn't seem to notice me, but I knew that was an act. I knew
 people were always watching every move I made. He braced his red-furred
 hands on the sides of his auctioneer's stand and leaned his splotched
 eagle beak toward us. ""Brothers, this being Thanksgiving, I pray the
 good Lord that we all are truly thankful for all that we have received.
 Amen.""


 Some skin-and-bones character I didn't know struggled out of his seat,
 amening. I could see he had a lot to be thankful for—somewhere he had
 received a fix.


 ""Brothers,"" Partridge went on after enjoying the interruption with a
 beaming smile, ""you shall all be entitled to a bowl of turkey soup
 prepared by Sister Partridge, a generous supply of sweet rolls and
 dinner rolls contributed by the Early Morning Bakery of this city,
 and all the coffee you can drink. Let us march out to
The Stars and
 Stripes Forever
, John Philip Sousa's grand old patriotic song.""


 I had to laugh at all those bums clattering the chairs in front of me,
 scampering after water soup and stale bread. As soon as I got cleaned
 up, I was going to have dinner in a good restaurant, and I was going to
 order such expensive food and leave such a large tip for the waiter and
 send one to the chef that they were going to think I was rich, and some
 executive with some brokerage firm would see me and say to himself,
 ""Hmm, executive material. Just the type we need. I beg your pardon,
 sir—"" just like the razor-blade comic-strip ads in the old magazines
 that Frankie the Pig sells three for a quarter.


 I was marching. Man, was I ever marching, but the secret of it was I
 was only marking time the way we did in fire drills at the school.


 They passed me, every one of them, and marched out of the meeting
 room into the kitchen. Even Partridge made his way down from the
 auctioneer's stand like a vulture with a busted wing and darted through
 his private door.


 I was alone, marking time behind the closed half of double doors. One
 good breath and I raced past the open door and flattened myself to the
 wall. Crockery was ringing and men were slurping inside. No one had
 paid any attention to me. That was pretty odd. People usually watch my
 every move, but a man's luck has to change sometime, doesn't it?


 Following the wallboard, I went down the side of the room and behind
 the last row of chairs, closer, closer, and halfway up the room again
 to the entrance—the entrance and the little wooden box fastened to the
 wall beside it.


 The box was old and made out of some varnished wood. There was a slot
 in the top. There wasn't any sign anywhere around it, but you knew it
 wasn't a mailbox.


 My hand went flat on the top of the box. One finger at a time drew up
 and slipped into the slot. Index, fore, third, little. I put my thumb
 in my palm and shoved. My hand went in.


 There were coins inside. I scooped them up with two fingers and held
 them fast with the other two. Once I dropped a dime—not a penny,
 milled edge—and I started to reach for it. No, don't be greedy. I knew
 I would probably lose my hold on all the coins if I tried for that one.
 I had all the rest. It felt like about two dollars, or close to it.


 Then I found the bill. A neatly folded bill in the box. Somehow I knew
 all along it would be there.
I tried to read the numbers on the bill with my fingertips, but I
 couldn't. It had to be a one. Who drops anything but a one into a Skid
 Row collection box? But still there were tourists, slummers. They might
 leave a fifty or even a hundred. A hundred!


 Yes, it felt new, crisp. It had to be a hundred. A single would be
 creased or worn.


 I pulled my hand out of the box. I
tried
to pull my hand out of the
 box.


 I knew what the trouble was, of course. I was in a monkey trap. The
 monkey reaches through the hole for the bait, and when he gets it in
 his hot little fist, he can't get his hand out. He's too greedy to let
 go, so he stays there, caught as securely as if he were caged.


 I was a man, not a monkey. I knew why I couldn't get my hand out. But I
 couldn't lose that money, especially that century bill. Calm, I ordered
 myself.
Calm.
The box was fastened to the vertical tongue-and-groove laths of the
 woodwork, not the wall. It was old lumber, stiffened by a hundred
 layers of paint since 1908. The paint was as thick and strong as the
 boards. The box was fastened fast. Six-inch spike nails, I guessed.


 Calmly, I flung my whole weight away from the wall. My wrist almost
 cracked, but there wasn't even a bend in the box. Carefully, I tried to
 jerk my fist straight up, to pry off the top of the box. It was as if
 the box had been carved out of one solid piece of timber. It wouldn't
 go up, down, left or right.


 But I kept trying.


 While keeping a lookout for Partridge and somebody stepping out of the
 kitchen for a pull on a bottle, I spotted the clock for the first
 time, a Western Union clock high up at the back of the hall. Just as
 I seen it for the first time, the electricity wound the spring motor
 inside like a chicken having its neck wrung.


 The next time I glanced at the clock, it said ten minutes had gone by.
 My hand still wasn't free and I hadn't budged the box.


 ""This,"" Brother Partridge said, ""is one of the most profound
 experiences of my life.""


 My head hinged until it lined my eyes up with Brother Partridge. The
 pipe hung heavy in my pocket, but he was too far from me.


 ""A vision of you at the box projected itself on the crest of my soup,""
 the preacher explained in wonderment.


 I nodded. ""Swimming right in there with the dead duck.""


 ""Cold turkey,"" he corrected. ""Are you scoffing at a miracle?""


 ""People are always watching me, Brother,"" I said. ""So now they do it
 even when they aren't around. I should have known it would come to
 that.""


 The pipe was suddenly a weight I wanted off me. I would try robbing
 a collection box, knowing positively that I would get caught, but I
 wasn't dumb enough to murder. Somebody, somewhere, would be a witness
 to it. I had never got away with anything in my life. I was too smart
 to even try anything but the little things.


 ""I may be able to help you,"" Brother Partridge said, ""if you have faith
 and a conscience.""


 ""I've got something better than a conscience,"" I told him.
Brother Partridge regarded me solemnly. ""There must be something
 special about you, for your apprehension to come through miraculous
 intervention. But I can't imagine what.""


 ""I
always
get apprehended somehow, Brother,"" I said. ""I'm pretty
 special.""


 ""Your name?""


 ""William Hagle."" No sense lying. I had been booked and printed before.


 Partridge prodded me with his bony fingers as if making sure I was
 substantial. ""Come. Let's sit down, if you can remove your fist from
 the money box.""


 I opened up my fingers and let the coins ring inside the box and I drew
 out my hand. The bill stuck to the sweat on my fingers and slid out
 along with the digits. A one, I decided. I had got into trouble for a
 grubby single. It wasn't any century. I had been kidding myself.


 I unfolded the note. Sure enough, it wasn't a hundred-dollar bill, but
 it was a twenty, and that was almost the same thing to me. I creased it
 and put it back into the slot.


 As long as it stalled off the cops, I'd talk to Partridge.


 We took a couple of camp chairs and I told him the story of my life, or
 most of it. It was hard work on an empty stomach; I wished I'd had some
 of that turkey soup. Then again I was glad I hadn't. Something always
 happened to me when I thought back over my life. The same thing.


 The men filed out of the kitchen, wiping their chins, and I went right
 on talking.


 After some time Sister Partridge bustled in and snapped on the overhead
 lights and I kept talking. The brother still hadn't used the phone to
 call the cops.


 ""Remarkable,"" Partridge finally said when I got so hoarse I had to take
 a break. ""One is almost—
almost
—reminded of Job. William, you are
 being punished for some great sin. Of that, I'm sure.""


 ""Punished for a sin? But, Brother, I've always had it like this, as
 long as I can remember. What kind of a sin could I have committed when
 I was fresh out of my crib?""


 ""William, all I can tell you is that time means nothing in Heaven. Do
 you deny the transmigration of souls?""


 ""Well,"" I said, ""I've had no personal experience—""


 ""Of course you have, William! Say you don't remember. Say you don't
 want to remember. But don't say you have no personal experience!""


 ""And you think I'm being punished for something I did in a previous
 life?""


 He looked at me in disbelief. ""What else could it be?""


 ""I don't know,"" I confessed. ""I certainly haven't done anything that
 bad in
this
life.""


 ""William, if you atone for this sin, perhaps the horde of locusts will
 lift from you.""


 It wasn't much of a chance, but I was unused to having any at all. I
 shook off the dizziness of it. ""By the Lord Harry, Brother, I'm going
 to give it a try!"" I cried.


 ""I believe you,"" Partridge said, surprised at himself.


 He ambled over to the money box on the wall. He tapped the bottom
 lightly and a box with no top slid out of the slightly larger box. He
 reached in, fished out the bill and presented it to me.


 ""Perhaps this will help in your atonement,"" he said.


 I crumpled it into my pocket fast. Not meaning to sound ungrateful, I'm
 pretty sure he hadn't noticed it was a twenty.


 And then the bill seemed to lie there, heavy, a lead weight. It would
 have been different if I had managed to get it out of the box myself.
 You know how it is.


 Money you haven't earned doesn't seem real to you.
There was something I forgot to mention so far. During the year between
 when I got out of the reformatory and the one when I tried to steal
 Brother Partridge's money, I killed a man.


 It was all an accident, but killing somebody is reason enough to get
 punished. It didn't have to be a sin in some previous life, you see.


 I had gotten my first job in too long, stacking boxes at the freight
 door of Baysinger's. The drivers unloaded the stuff, but they just
 dumped it off the truck. An empty rear end was all they wanted. The
 freight boss told me to stack the boxes inside, neat and not too close
 together.


 I stacked boxes the first day. I stacked more the second. The third day
 I went outside with my baloney and crackers. It was warm enough even
 for November.


 Two of them, dressed like Harvard seniors, caps and striped duffer
 jackets, came up to the crate I was dining off.


 ""Work inside, Jack?"" the taller one asked.


 ""Yeah,"" I said, chewing.


 ""What do you do, Jack?"" the fatter one asked.


 ""Stack boxes.""


 ""Got a union card?""


 I shook my head.


 ""Application?""


 ""No,"" I said. ""I'm just helping out during Christmas.""


 ""You're a scab, buddy,"" Long-legs said. ""Don't you read the papers?""


 ""I don't like comic strips,"" I said.


 They sighed. I think they hated to do it, but I was bucking the system.


 Fats hit me high. Long-legs hit me low. I blew cracker crumbs into
 their faces. After that, I just let them go. I know how to take a
 beating. That's one thing I knew.


 Then lying there, bleeding to myself, I heard them talking. I heard
 noises like
make an example of him
and
do something permanent
and I
 squirmed away across the rubbish like a polite mouse.


 I made it around a corner of brick and stood up, hurting my knee on a
 piece of brown-splotched pipe. There were noises on the other angle of
 the corner and so I tested if the pipe was loose and it was. I closed
 my eyes and brought the pipe up and then down.


 It felt as if I connected, but I was so numb, I wasn't sure until I
 unscrewed my eyes.


 There was a big man in a heavy wool overcoat and gray homburg spread on
 a damp centerfold from the
News
. There was a pick-up slip from the
 warehouse under the fingers of one hand, and somebody had beaten his
 brains out.


 The police figured it was part of some labor dispute, I guess, and they
 never got to me.


 I suppose I was to blame anyway. If I hadn't been alive, if I hadn't
 been there to get beaten up, it wouldn't have happened. I could see
 the point in making me suffer for it. There was a lot to be said for
 looking at it like that. But there was nothing to be said for telling
 Brother Partridge about the accident, or murder, or whatever had
 happened that day.
Searching myself after I left Brother Partridge, I finally found a
 strip of gray adhesive tape on my side, out of the fuzzy area. Making
 the twenty the size of a thick postage stamp, I peeled back the tape
 and put the folded bill on the white skin and smoothed the tape back.


 There was only one place for me to go now. I headed for the public
 library. It was only about twenty blocks, but not having had anything
 to eat since the day before, it enervated me.


 The downstairs washroom was where I went first. There was nobody
 there but an old guy talking urgently to a kid with thick glasses,
 and somebody building a fix in one of the booths. I could see charred
 matches dropping down on the floor next to his tennis shoes, and even a
 few grains of white stuff. But he managed to hold still enough to keep
 from spilling more from the spoon.


 I washed my hands and face, smoothed my hair down, combing it with my
 fingers. Going over my suit with damp toweling got off a lot of the
 dirt. I put my collar on the outside of my jacket and creased the
 wings with my thumbnail so it would look more like a sports shirt.
 It didn't really. I still looked like a bum, but sort of a neat,
 non-objectionable bum.


 The librarian at the main desk looked sympathetically hostile, or
 hostilely sympathetic.


 ""I'd like to get into the stacks, miss,"" I said, ""and see some of the
 old newspapers.""


 ""Which newspapers?"" the old girl asked stiffly.


 I thought back. I couldn't remember the exact date. ""Ones for the first
 week in November last year.""


 ""We have the
Times
microfilmed. I would have to project them for you.""


 ""I didn't want to see the
Times
,"" I said, fast. ""Don't you have any
 newspapers on paper?"" I didn't want her to see what I wanted to read up
 on.


 ""We have the
News
, bound, for last year.""


 I nodded. ""That's the one I wanted to see.""


 She sniffed and told me to follow her. I didn't rate a cart to my
 table, I guess, or else the bound papers weren't supposed to come out
 of the stacks.


 The cases of books, row after row, smelled good. Like old leather and
 good pipe tobacco. I had been here before. In this world, it's the man
 with education who makes the money. I had been reading the Funk &amp;
 Wagnalls Encyclopedia. So far I knew a lot about Mark Antony, Atomic
 Energy, Boron, Brussels, Catapults, Demons, and Divans.


 I guess I had stopped to look around at some of the titles, because the
 busy librarian said sharply, ""Follow me.""


 I heard my voice say, ""A pleasure. What about after work?""


 I didn't say it, but I was used to my voice independently saying
 things. Her neck got to flaming, but she walked stiffly ahead. She
 didn't say anything. She must be awful mad, I decided. But then I got
 the idea she was flushed with pleasure. I'm pretty ugly and I looked
 like a bum, but I was young. You had to grant me that.


 She waved a hand at the rows of bound
News
and left me alone with
 them. I wasn't sure if I was allowed to hunt up a table to lay the
 books on or not, so I took the volume for last year and laid it on the
 floor. That was the cleanest floor I ever saw.


 It didn't take me long to find the story. The victim was a big man,
 because the story was on the second page of the Nov. 4 edition.


 I started to tear the page out, then only memorized the name and home
 address. Somebody was sure to see me and I couldn't risk trouble just
 now.


 I stuck the book back in line and left by the side door.
I went to a dry-cleaner, not the cheapest place I knew, because I
 wouldn't be safe with the change from a twenty in that neighborhood.
 My suit was cleaned while I waited. I paid a little extra and had
 it mended. Funny thing about a suit—it's almost never completely
 shot unless you just have it ripped off you or burned up. It wasn't
 exactly in style, but some rich executives wore suits out of style
 that they had paid a lot of money for. I remembered Fredric March's
 double-breasted in
Executive Suite
while Walter Pidgeon and the rest
 wore Ivy Leagues. Maybe I would look like an eccentric executive.


 I bought a new shirt, a good used pair of shoes, and a dime pack of
 single-edged razor blades. I didn't have a razor, but anybody with
 nerve can shave with a single-edge blade and soap and water.


 The clerk took my two bucks in advance and I went up to my room.


 I washed out my socks and underwear, took a bath, shaved and trimmed
 my hair and nails with the razor blade. With some soap on my finger, I
 scrubbed my teeth. Finally I got dressed.


 Everything was all right except that I didn't have a tie. They had
 them, a quarter a piece, where I got the shoes. It was only six
 blocks—I could go back. But I didn't want to wait. I wanted to
 complete the picture.


 The razor blade sliced through the pink bath towel evenly. I cut out a
 nice modern-style tie, narrow, with some horizontal stripes down at the
 bottom. I made a tight, thin knot. It looked pretty good.


 I was ready to leave, so I started for the door. I went back. I had
 almost forgotten my luggage. The box still had three unwrapped blades
 in it. I pocketed it. I hefted the used blade, dulled by all the work
 it had done. You can run being economical into stinginess. I tossed it
 into the wastebasket.


 I had five hamburgers and five cups of coffee. I couldn't finish all of
 the French fries.


 ""Mac,"" I said to the fat counterman, who looked like all fat
 countermen, ""give me a Milwaukee beer.""


 He stopped polishing the counter in front of his friend. ""Milwaukee,
 Wisconsin, or Milwaukee, Oregon?""


 ""Wisconsin.""


 He didn't argue.


 It was cold and bitter. All beer is bitter, no matter what they say on
 TV. I like beer. I like the bitterness of it.


 It felt like another, but I checked myself. I needed a clear head.
 I thought about going back to the hotel for some sleep; I still had
 the key in my pocket (I wasn't trusting it to any clerk). No, I had
 had sleep on Thanksgiving, bracing up for trying the lift at Brother
 Partridge's. Let's see, it was daylight outside again, so this was the
 day after Thanksgiving. But it had only been sixteen or twenty hours
 since I had slept. That was enough.


 I left the money on the counter for the hamburgers and coffee and the
 beer. There was $7.68 left.


 As I passed the counterman's friend on his stool, my voice said, ""I
 think you're yellow.""


 He turned slowly, his jaw moving further away from his brain.


 I winked. ""It was just a bet for me to say that to you. I won two
 bucks. Half of it is yours."" I held out the bill to him.


 His paw closed over the money and punched me on the biceps. Too hard.
 He winked back. ""It's okay.""


 I rubbed my shoulder, marching off fast, and I counted my money. With
 my luck, I might have given the counterman's friend the five instead of
 one of the singles. But I hadn't. I now had $6.68 left.


 ""I
still
think you're yellow,"" my voice said.


 It was my voice, but it didn't come from me. There were no words, no
 feeling of words in my throat. It just came out of the air the way it
 always did.


 I ran.
Harold R. Thompkins, 49, vice-president of Baysinger's, was found
 dead behind the store last night. His skull had been crushed by a
 vicious beating with a heavy implement, Coroner McClain announced in
 preliminary verdict. Tompkins, who resided at 1467 Claremont, Edgeway,
 had been active in seeking labor-management peace in the recent
 difficulties....


 I had read that a year before. The car cards on the clanking subway and
 the rumbling bus didn't seem nearly so interesting to me. Outside the
 van, a tasteful sign announced the limits of the village of Edgeway,
 and back inside, the monsters of my boyhood went
bloomp
at me.


 I hadn't seen anything like them in years.


 The slimy, scaly beasts were slithering over the newspaper holders,
 the ad card readers, the girl watchers as the neat little carbon-copy
 modern homes breezed past the windows.
I ignored the devils and concentrated on reading the withered,
 washed-out political posters on the telephone poles. My neck ached from
 holding it so stiff, staring out through the glass. More than that, I
 could feel the jabberwocks staring at me. You know how it is. You can
 feel a stare with the back of your neck and between your eyes. They got
 one brush of a gaze out of me.


 The things abruptly started their business, trying to act casually as
 if they hadn't been waiting for me to look at them at all. They had a
 little human being of some sort.


 It was the size of a small boy, like the small boy who looked like me
 that they used to destroy when I was locked up with them in the dark.
 Except this was a man, scaled down to child's size. He had sort of an
 ugly, worried, tired, stupid look and he wore a shiny suit with a piece
 of a welcome mat or something for a necktie. Yeah, it was me. I really
 knew it all the time.


 They began doing things to the midget me. I didn't even lift an
 eyebrow. They couldn't do anything worse to the small man than they
 had done to the young boy. It was sort of nostalgic watching them, but
 I really got bored with all that violence and killing and killing the
 same kill over and over. Like watching the Saturday night string of
 westerns in a bar.


 The sunlight through the window was yellow and hot. After a time, I
 began to dose.


 The shrieks woke me up.


 For the first time, I could hear the shrieks of the monster's victim
 and listen to their obscene droolings. For the very first time in my
 life. Always before it had been all pantomime, like Charlie Chaplin.
 Now I heard the sounds of it all.


 They say it's a bad sign when you start hearing voices.


 I nearly panicked, but I held myself in the seat and forced myself
 to be rational about it. My own voice was always saying things
everybody
could hear but which I didn't say. It wasn't any worse to
 be the
only
one who could hear other things I never said. I was as
 sane as I ever was. There was no doubt about that.


 But a new thought suddenly impressed itself on me.


 Whatever was punishing me for my sin was determined that I turn back
 before reaching 1467 Claremont.

There is one fact no sane man can quarrel

 with ... everything has a beginning and an end.

 But some men aren't sane; thus it isn't always so!
No, you're wrong. I'm not your father's ghost, even if I do look a bit
 like him. But it's a longish story, and you might as well let me in.
 You will, you know, so why quibble about it? At least, you always
 have ... or do ... or will. I don't know, verbs get all mixed up. We
 don't have the right attitude toward tenses for a situation like this.


 Anyhow, you'll let me in. I did, so you will.


 Thanks. You think you're crazy, of course, but you'll find out you
 aren't. It's just that things are a bit confused. And don't look at the
 machine out there too long—until you get used to it, you'll find it's
 hard on the eyes, trying to follow where the vanes go. You'll get used
 to it, of course, but it will take about thirty years.


 You're wondering whether to give me a drink, as I remember it. Why not?
 And naturally, since we have the same tastes, you can make the same for
 me as you're having. Of course we have the same tastes—we're the same
 person. I'm you thirty years from now, or you're me. I remember just
 how you feel; I felt the same way when he—that is, of course, I or
 we—came back to tell me about it, thirty years ago.


 Here, have one of these. You'll get to like them in a couple more
 years. And you can look at the revenue stamp date, if you still doubt
 my story. You'll believe it eventually, though, so it doesn't matter.


 Right now, you're shocked. It's a real wrench when a man meets himself
 for the first time. Some kind of telepathy seems to work between two
 of the same people. You
sense
things. So I'll simply go ahead talking
 for half an hour or so, until you get over it. After that you'll come
 along with me. You know, I could try to change things around by telling
 what happened to me; but he—I—told me what I was going to do, so I
 might as well do the same. I probably couldn't help telling you the
 same thing in the same words, even if I tried—and I don't intend to
 try. I've gotten past that stage in worrying about all this.


 So let's begin when you get up in half an hour and come out with me.
 You'll take a closer look at the machine, then. Yes, it'll be pretty
 obvious it must be a time machine. You'll sense that, too. You've seen
 it, just a small little cage with two seats, a luggage compartment, and
 a few buttons on a dash. You'll be puzzling over what I'll tell you,
 and you'll be getting used to the idea that you are the man who makes
 atomic power practical. Jerome Boell, just a plain engineer, the man
 who put atomic power in every home. You won't exactly believe it, but
 you'll want to go along.
I'll be tired of talking by then, and in a hurry to get going. So I
 cut off your questions, and get you inside. I snap on a green button,
 and everything seems to cut off around us. You can see a sort of
 foggy nothing surrounding the cockpit; it is probably the field that
 prevents passage through time from affecting us. The luggage section
 isn't protected, though.
You start to say something, but by then I'm pressing a black button,
 and everything outside will disappear. You look for your house, but
 it isn't there. There is exactly nothing there—in fact, there is no
there
. You are completely outside of time and space, as best you can
 guess how things are.


 You can't feel any motion, of course. You try to reach a hand out
 through the field into the nothing around you and your hand goes out,
 all right, but nothing happens. Where the screen ends, your hand just
 turns over and pokes back at you. Doesn't hurt, and when you pull your
 arm back, you're still sound and uninjured. But it looks frightening
 and you don't try it again.


 Then it comes to you slowly that you're actually traveling in time.
 You turn to me, getting used to the idea. ""So this is the fourth
 dimension?"" you ask.


 Then you feel silly, because you'll remember that I said you'd ask
 that. Well, I asked it after I was told, then I came back and told it
 to you, and I still can't help answering when you speak.


 ""Not exactly,"" I try to explain. ""Maybe it's no dimension—or it might
 be the fifth; if you're going to skip over the so-called fourth without
 traveling along it, you'd need a fifth. Don't ask me. I didn't invent
 the machine and I don't understand it.""


 ""But....""


 I let it go, and so do you. If you don't, it's a good way of going
 crazy. You'll see later why I couldn't have invented the machine. Of
 course, there may have been a start for all this once. There may have
 been a time when you did invent the machine—the atomic motor first,
 then the time-machine. And when you closed the loop by going back and
 saving yourself the trouble, it got all tangled up. I figured out once
 that such a universe would need some seven or eight time and space
 dimensions. It's simpler just to figure that this is the way time got
 bent back on itself. Maybe there is no machine, and it's just easier
 for us to imagine it. When you spend thirty years thinking about it, as
 I did—and you will—you get further and further from an answer.


 Anyhow, you sit there, watching nothing all around you, and no time,
 apparently, though there is a time effect back in the luggage space.
 You look at your watch and it's still running. That means you either
 carry a small time field with you, or you are catching a small
 increment of time from the main field. I don't know, and you won't
 think about that then, either.
I'm smoking, and so are you, and the air in the machine is getting a
 bit stale. You suddenly realize that everything in the machine is wide
 open, yet you haven't seen any effects of air loss.


 ""Where are we getting our air?"" you ask. ""Or why don't we lose it?""


 ""No place for it to go,"" I explain. There isn't. Out there is neither
 time nor space, apparently. How could the air leak out? You still feel
 gravity, but I can't explain that, either. Maybe the machine has a
 gravity field built in, or maybe the time that makes your watch run is
 responsible for gravity. In spite of Einstein, you have always had the
 idea that time is an effect of gravity, and I sort of agree, still.


 Then the machine stops—at least, the field around us cuts off. You
 feel a dankish sort of air replace the stale air, and you breathe
 easier, though we're in complete darkness, except for the weak light in
 the machine, which always burns, and a few feet of rough dirty cement
 floor around. You take another cigaret from me and you get out of the
 machine, just as I do.


 I've got a bundle of clothes and I start changing. It's a sort
 of simple, short-limbed, one-piece affair I put on, but it feels
 comfortable.


 ""I'm staying here,"" I tell you. ""This is like the things they wear in
 this century, as near as I can remember it, and I should be able to
 pass fairly well. I've had all my fortune—the one you make on that
 atomic generator—invested in such a way I can get it on using some
 identification I've got with me, so I'll do all right. I know they
 still use some kind of money, you'll see evidence of that. And it's a
 pretty easygoing civilization, from what I could see. We'll go up and
 I'll leave you. I like the looks of things here, so I won't be coming
 back with you.""


 You nod, remembering I've told you about it. ""What century is this,
 anyway?""


 I'd told you that, too, but you've forgotten. ""As near as I can guess,
 it's about 2150. He told me, just as I'm telling you, that it's an
 interstellar civilization.""


 You take another cigaret from me, and follow me. I've got a small
 flashlight and we grope through a pile of rubbish, out into a corridor.
 This is a sub-sub-sub-basement. We have to walk up a flight of stairs,
 and there is an elevator waiting, fortunately with the door open.


 ""What about the time machine?"" you ask.


 ""Since nobody ever stole it, it's safe.""
We get in the elevator, and I say ""first"" to it. It gives out a
 coughing noise and the basement openings begin to click by us. There's
 no feeling of acceleration—some kind of false gravity they use in the
 future. Then the door opens, and the elevator says ""first"" back at us.


 It's obviously a service elevator and we're in a dim corridor, with
 nobody around. I grab your hand and shake it. ""You go that way. Don't
 worry about getting lost; you never did, so you can't. Find the museum,
 grab the motor, and get out. And good luck to you.""


 You act as if you're dreaming, though you can't believe it's a dream.
 You nod at me and I move out into the main corridor. A second later,
 you see me going by, mixed into a crowd that is loafing along toward
 a restaurant, or something like it, that is just opening. I'm asking
 questions of a man, who points, and I turn and move off.


 You come out of the side corridor and go down a hall, away from the
 restaurant. There are quiet little signs along the hall. You look at
 them, realizing for the first time that things have changed.
Steij:neri, Faunten, Z:rgat Dispenseri.
The signs are very quiet and
 dignified. Some of them can be decoded to stationery shops, fountains,
 and the like. What a zergot is, you don't know. You stop at a sign
 that announces:
Trav:l Biwrou—F:rst-Clas Twrz—Marz, Viin*s, and
 x: Trouj:n Planets. Spej:l reits tu aol s*nz wixin 60 lyt iirz!
But
 there is only a single picture of a dull-looking metal sphere, with
 passengers moving up a ramp, and the office is closed. You begin to get
 the hang of the spelling they use, though.


 Now there are people around you, but nobody pays much attention to you.
 Why should they? You wouldn't care if you saw a man in a leopard-skin
 suit; you'd figure it was some part in a play and let it go. Well,
 people don't change much.


 You get up your courage and go up to a boy selling something that might
 be papers on tapes.


 ""Where can I find the Museum of Science?""


 ""Downayer rien turn lefa the sign. Stoo bloss,"" he tells you. Around
 you, you hear some pretty normal English, but there are others using
 stuff as garbled as his. The educated and uneducated? I don't know.


 You go right until you find a big sign built into the rubbery surface
 of the walk:
Miuzi:m *v Syens
. There's an arrow pointing and you turn
 left. Ahead of you, two blocks on, you can see a pink building, with
 faint aqua trimming, bigger than most of the others. They are building
 lower than they used to, apparently. Twenty floors up seems about the
 maximum. You head for it, and find the sidewalk is marked with the
 information that it is the museum.
You go up the steps, but you see that it seems to be closed. You
 hesitate for a moment, then. You're beginning to think the whole affair
 is complete nonsense, and you should get back to the time machine and
 go home. But then a guard comes to the gate. Except for the short legs
 in his suit and the friendly grin on his face, he looks like any other
 guard.


 What's more, he speaks pretty clearly. Everyone says things in a sort
 of drawl, with softer vowels and slurred consonants, but it's rather
 pleasant.


 ""Help you, sir? Oh, of course. You must be playing in 'Atoms and
 Axioms.' The museum's closed, but I'll be glad to let you study
 whatever you need for realism in your role. Nice show. I saw it twice.""


 ""Thanks,"" you mutter, wondering what kind of civilization can produce
 guards as polite as that. ""I—I'm told I should investigate your
 display of atomic generators.""


 He beams at that. ""Of course."" The gate is swung to behind you, but
 obviously he isn't locking it. In fact, there doesn't seem to be a
 lock. ""Must be a new part. You go down that corridor, up one flight
 of stairs and left. Finest display in all the known worlds. We've got
 the original of the first thirteen models. Professor Jonas was using
 them to check his latest theory of how they work. Too bad he could
 not explain the principle, either. Someone will, some day, though.
 Lord, the genius of that twentieth century inventor! It's quite a
 hobby with me, sir. I've read everything I could get on the period.
 Oh—congratulations on your pronunciation. Sounds just like some of our
 oldest tapes.""


 You get away from him, finally, after some polite thanks. The building
 seems deserted and you wander up the stairs. There's a room on your
 right filled with something that proclaims itself the first truly
 plastic diamond former, and you go up to it. As you come near, it
 goes through a crazy wiggle inside, stops turning out a continual row
 of what seem to be bearings, and slips something the size of a penny
 toward you.


 ""Souvenir,"" it announces in a well-modulated voice. ""This is a typical
 gem of the twentieth century, properly cut to 58 facets, known
 technically as a Jaegger diamond, and approximately twenty carats
 in size. You can have it made into a ring on the third floor during
 morning hours for one-tenth credit. If you have more than one child,
 press the red button for the number of stones you desire.""


 You put it in your pocket, gulping a little, and get back to the
 corridor. You turn left and go past a big room in which models of
 spaceships—from the original thing that looks like a V-2, and is
 labeled first Lunar rocket, to a ten-foot globe, complete with
 miniature manikins—are sailing about in some kind of orbits. Then
 there is one labeled
Wep:nz
, filled with everything from a crossbow
 to a tiny rod four inches long and half the thickness of a pencil,
 marked
Fynal Hand Arm
. Beyond is the end of the corridor, and a big
 place that bears a sign,
Mad:lz *v Atamic Pau:r Sorsez
.
By that time, you're almost convinced. And you've been doing a lot of
 thinking about what you can do. The story I'm telling has been sinking
 in, but you aren't completely willing to accept it.


 You notice that the models are all mounted on tables and that they're a
 lot smaller than you thought. They seem to be in chronological order,
 and the latest one, marked
2147—Rincs Dyn*pat:
, is about the size
 of a desk telephone. The earlier ones are larger, of course, clumsier,
 but with variations, probably depending on the power output. A big sign
 on the ceiling gives a lot of dope on atomic generators, explaining
 that this is the first invention which leaped full blown into basically
 final form.


 You study it, but it mentions casually the inventor, without giving
 his name. Either they don't know it, or they take it for granted that
 everyone does, which seems more probable. They call attention to the
 fact that they have the original model of the first atomic generator
 built, complete with design drawings, original manuscript on operation,
 and full patent application.


 They state that it has all major refinements, operating on any fuel,
 producing electricity at any desired voltage up to five million, any
 chosen cyclic rate from direct current to one thousand megacycles,
 and any amperage up to one thousand, its maximum power output being
 fifty kilowatts, limited by the current-carrying capacity of the
 outputs. They also mention that the operating principle is still being
 investigated, and that only such refinements as better alloys and the
 addition of magnetric and nucleatric current outlets have been added
 since the original.


 So you go to the end and look over the thing. It's simply a square box
 with a huge plug on each side, and a set of vernier controls on top,
 plus a little hole marked, in old-style spelling,
Drop BBs or wire
 here
. Apparently that's the way it's fueled. It's about one foot on
 each side.


 ""Nice,"" the guard says over your shoulder. ""It finally wore out one of
 the cathogrids and we had to replace that, but otherwise it's exactly
 as the great inventor made it. And it still operates as well as ever.
 Like to have me tell you about it?""


 ""Not particularly,"" you begin, and then realize bad manners might be
 conspicuous here. While you're searching for an answer, the guard pulls
 something out of his pocket and stares at it.


 ""Fine, fine. The mayor of Altasecarba—Centaurian, you know—is
 arriving, but I'll be back in about ten minutes. He wants to examine
 some of the weapons for a monograph on Centaurian primitives compared
 to nineteenth century man. You'll pardon me?""


 You pardon him pretty eagerly and he wanders off happily. You go up
 to the head of the line, to that Rinks Dynapattuh, or whatever it
 transliterates to. That's small and you can carry it. But the darned
 thing is absolutely fixed. You can't see any bolts, but you can't budge
 it, either.
You work down the line. It'd be foolish to take the early model if you
 can get one with built-in magnetic current terminals—Ehrenhaft or
 some other principle?—and nuclear binding-force energy terminals. But
 they're all held down by the same whatchamaycallem effect.


 And, finally, you're right back beside the original first model. It's
 probably bolted down, too, but you try it tentatively and you find it
 moves. There's a little sign under it, indicating you shouldn't touch
 it, since the gravostatic plate is being renewed.


 Well, you won't be able to change the time cycle by doing anything I
 haven't told you, but a working model such as that is a handy thing.
 You lift it; it only weighs about fifty pounds! Naturally, it can be
 carried.


 You expect a warning bell, but nothing happens. As a matter of fact,
 if you'd stop drinking so much of that scotch and staring at the time
 machine out there now, you'd hear what I'm saying and know what will
 happen to you. But of course, just as I did, you're going to miss a
 lot of what I say from now on, and have to find out for yourself. But
 maybe some of it helps. I've tried to remember how much I remembered,
 after he told me, but I can't be sure. So I'll keep on talking. I
 probably can't help it, anyhow. Pre-set, you might say.


 Well, you stagger down the corridor, looking out for the guard, but all
 seems clear. Then you hear his voice from the weapons room. You bend
 down and try to scurry past, but you know you're in full view. Nothing
 happens, though.


 You stumble down the stairs, feeling all the futuristic rays in the
 world on your back, and still nothing happens. Ahead of you, the gate
 is closed. You reach it and it opens obligingly by itself. You breathe
 a quick sigh of relief and start out onto the street.


 Then there's a yell behind you. You don't wait. You put one leg in
 front of the other and you begin racing down the walk, ducking past
 people, who stare at you with expressions you haven't time to see.
 There's another yell behind you.


 Something goes over your head and drops on the sidewalk just in front
 of your feet, with a sudden ringing sound. You don't wait to find out
 about that, either. Somebody reaches out a hand to catch you and you
 dart past.
The street is pretty clear now and you jolt along, with your arms
 seeming to come out of the sockets, and that atomic generator getting
 heavier at every step.


 Out of nowhere, something in a blue uniform about six feet tall and
 on the beefy side appears—and the badge hasn't changed much. The cop
 catches your arm and you know you're not going to get away, so you stop.


 ""You can't exert yourself that hard in this heat, fellow,"" the cop
 says. ""There are laws against that, without a yellow sticker. Here, let
 me grab you a taxi.""
Reaction sets in a bit and your knees begin to buckle, but you shake
 your head and come up for air.


 ""I—I left my money home,"" you begin.


 The cop nods. ""Oh, that explains it. Fine, I won't have to give you
 an appearance schedule. But you should have come to me."" He reaches
 out and taps a pedestrian lightly on the shoulder. ""Sir, an emergency
 request. Would you help this gentleman?""
The pedestrian grins, looks at his watch, and nods. ""How far?""


 You did notice the name of the building from which you came and you
 mutter it. The stranger nods again, reaches out and picks up the other
 side of the generator, blowing a little whistle the cop hands him.
 Pedestrians begin to move aside, and you and the stranger jog down the
 street at a trot, with a nice clear path, while the cop stands beaming
 at you both.


 That way, it isn't so bad. And you begin to see why I decided I might
 like to stay in the future. But all the same, the organized cooperation
 here doesn't look too good. The guard can get the same and be there
 before you.


 And he is. He stands just inside the door of the building as you reach
 it. The stranger lifts an eyebrow and goes off at once when you nod
 at him, not waiting for thanks. And the guard comes up, holding some
 dinkus in his hand, about the size of a big folding camera and not too
 dissimilar in other ways. He snaps it open and you get set to duck.


 ""You forgot the prints, monograph, and patent applications,"" he says.
 ""They go with the generator—we don't like to have them separated. A
 good thing I knew the production office of 'Atoms and Axioms' was in
 this building. Just let us know when you're finished with the model and
 we'll pick it up.""


 You swallow several sets of tonsils you had removed years before, and
 take the bundle of papers he hands you out of the little case. He pumps
 you for some more information, which you give him at random. It seems
 to satisfy your amiable guard friend. He finally smiles in satisfaction
 and heads back to the museum.


 You still don't believe it, but you pick up the atomic generator and
 the information sheets, and you head down toward the service elevator.
 There is no button on it. In fact, there's no door there.


 You start looking for other doors or corridors, but you know this is
 right. The signs along the halls are the same as they were.
Then there's a sort of cough and something dilates in the wall. It
 forms a perfect door and the elevator stands there waiting. You get in,
 gulping out something about going all the way down, and then wonder how
 a machine geared for voice operation can make anything of that. What
 the deuce would that lowest basement be called? But the elevator has
 closed and is moving downward in a hurry. It coughs again and you're at
 the original level. You get out—and realize you don't have a light.


 You'll never know what you stumbled over, but, somehow, you move back
 in the direction of the time machine, bumping against boxes, staggering
 here and there, and trying to find the right place by sheer feel. Then
 a shred of dim light appears; it's the weak light in the time machine.


 You've located it.


 You put the atomic generator in the luggage space, throw the papers
 down beside it, and climb into the cockpit, sweating and mumbling. You
 reach forward toward the green button and hesitate. There's a red one
 beside it and you finally decide on that.


 Suddenly, there's a confused yell from the direction of the elevator
 and a beam of light strikes against your eyes, with a shout punctuating
 it. Your finger touches the red button.


 You'll never know what the shouting was about—whether they finally
 doped out the fact that they'd been robbed, or whether they were trying
 to help you. You don't care which it is. The field springs up around
 you and the next button you touch—the one on the board that hasn't
 been used so far—sends you off into nothingness. There is no beam of
 light, you can't hear a thing, and you're safe.


 It isn't much of a trip back. You sit there smoking and letting your
 nerves settle back to normal. You notice a third set of buttons, with
 some pencil marks over them—""Press these to return to yourself 30
 years""—and you begin waiting for the air to get stale. It doesn't
 because there is only one of you this time.


 Instead, everything flashes off and you're sitting in the machine in
 your own back yard.


 You'll figure out the cycle in more details later. You get into the
 machine in front of your house, go to the future in the sub-basement,
 land in your back yard, and then hop back thirty years to pick up
 yourself, landing in front of your house. Just that. But right then,
 you don't care. You jump out and start pulling out that atomic
 generator and taking it inside.
It isn't hard to disassemble, but you don't learn a thing; just some
 plates of metal, some spiral coils, and a few odds and ends—all
 things that can be made easily enough, all obviously of common metals.
 But when you put it together again, about an hour later, you notice
 something.


 Everything in it is brand-new and there's one set of copper wires
 missing! It won't work. You put some #12 house wire in, exactly like
 the set on the other side, drop in some iron filings, and try it again.


 And with the controls set at 120 volts, 60 cycles and 15 amperes, you
 get just that. You don't need the power company any more. And you
 feel a little happier when you realize that the luggage space wasn't
 insulated from time effects by a field, so the motor has moved backward
 in time, somehow, and is back to its original youth—minus the
 replaced wires the guard mentioned—which probably wore out because of
 the makeshift job you've just done.


 But you begin getting more of a jolt when you find that the papers are
 all in your own writing, that your name is down as the inventor, and
 that the date of the patent application is 1951.


 It will begin to soak in, then. You pick up an atomic generator in the
 future and bring it back to the past—your present—so that it can be
 put in the museum with you as the inventor so you can steal it to be
 the inventor. And you do it in a time machine which you bring back to
 yourself to take yourself into the future to return to take back to
 yourself....


 Who invented what? And who built which?


 Before long, your riches from the generator are piling in. Little
 kids from school are coming around to stare at the man who changed
 history and made atomic power so common that no nation could hope to
 be anything but a democracy and a peaceful one—after some of the
 worst times in history for a few years. Your name eventually becomes as
 common as Ampere, or Faraday, or any other spelled without a capital
 letter.


 But you're thinking of the puzzle. You can't find any answer.


 One day you come across an old poem—something about some folks
 calling it evolution and others calling it God. You go out, make a few
 provisions for the future, and come back to climb into the time machine
 that's waiting in the building you had put around it. Then you'll be
 knocking on your own door, thirty years back—or right now, from your
 view—and telling your younger self all these things I'm telling you.


 But now....


 Well, the drinks are finished. You're woozy enough to go along with me
 without protest, and I want to find out just why those people up there
 came looking for you and shouting, before the time machine left.


 Let's go.

The only kind of gag worth pulling, I always
 
maintained, was a cosmic one—till I learned the
 
Cosmos has a really nasty sense of humor!
There were three of them. Dozens of limp little mutants that would have
 sent an academic zoologist into hysterics lay there in the metabolic
 accelerator. But there were three of
them
. My heart took a great
 bound.


 I heard my daughter's running feet in the animal rooms and her
 rollerskates banging at her side. I closed the accelerator and walked
 across to the laboratory door. She twisted the knob violently, trying
 to hit a combination that would work.


 I unlocked the door, held it against her pushing and slipped out so
 that, for all her peering, she could see nothing. I looked down on her
 tolerantly.


 ""Can't adjust your skates?"" I asked again.


 ""Daddy, I've tried and tried and I just can't turn this old key tight
 enough.""


 I continued to look down on her.


 ""Well, Dad-dee, I can't!""


 ""Tightly enough.""


 ""What?""


 ""You can't turn this old key tightly enough.""


 ""That's what I
say
-yud.""


 ""All right, wench. Sit on this chair.""


 I got down and shoved one saddle shoe into a skate. It fitted
 perfectly. I strapped her ankle and pretended to use the key to tighten
 the clamp.


 Volplas at last. Three of them. Yet I had always been so sure I could
 create them that I had been calling them volplas for ten years. No,
 twelve. I glanced across the animal room to where old Nijinsky thrust
 his graying head from a cage. I had called them volplas since the day
 old Nijinsky's elongated arms and his cousin's lateral skin folds had
 given me the idea of a flying mutant.
When Nijinsky saw me looking at him, he started a little tarantella
 about his cage. I smiled with nostalgia when the fifth fingers of his
 hands, four times as long as the others, uncurled as he spun about the
 cage.
I turned to the fitting of my daughter's other skate.


 ""Daddy?""


 ""Yes?""


 ""Mother says you are eccentric. Is that true?""


 ""I'll speak to her about it.""


 ""Don't you
know
?""


 ""Do you understand the word?""


 ""No.""


 I lifted her out of the chair and stood her on her skates. ""Tell your
 mother that I retaliate. I say
she
is beautiful.""


 She skated awkwardly between the rows of cages from which mutants with
 brown fur and blue fur, too much and too little fur, enormously long
 and ridiculously short arms, stared at her with simian, canine or
 rodent faces. At the door to the outside, she turned perilously and
 waved.


 Again in the laboratory, I entered the metabolic accelerator and
 withdrew the intravenous needles from my first volplas. I carried their
 limp little forms out to a mattress in the lab, two girls and a boy.
 The accelerator had forced them almost to adulthood in less than a
 month. It would be several hours before they would begin to move, to
 learn to feed and play, perhaps to learn to fly.


 Meanwhile, it was clear that here was no war of dominant mutations.
 Modulating alleles had smoothed the freakish into a beautiful pattern.
 These were no monsters blasted by the dosage of radiation into crippled
 structures. They were lovely, perfect little creatures.


 My wife tried the door, too, but more subtly, as if casually touching
 the knob while calling.


 ""Lunch, dear.""


 ""Be right there.""


 She peeked too, as she had for fifteen years, but I blocked her view
 when I slipped out.


 ""Come on, you old hermit. I have a buffet on the terrace.""


 ""Our daughter says I'm eccentric. Wonder how the devil she found out.""


 ""From me, of course.""


 ""But you love me just the same.""


 ""I adore you."" She stretched on tiptoe and put her arms over my
 shoulders and kissed me.


 My wife did indeed have a delicious-looking buffet ready on the
 terrace. The maid was just setting down a warmer filled with hot
 hamburgers. I gave the maid a pinch and said, ""Hello, baby.""


 My wife looked at me with a puzzled smile. ""What on Earth's got into
 you?""


 The maid beat it into the house.


 I flipped a hamburger and a slice of onion onto a plate and picked up
 the ketchup and said, ""I've reached the dangerous age.""


 ""Oh, good heavens!""
I dowsed ketchup over the hamburger, threw the onion on and closed it.
 I opened a bottle of beer and guzzled from it, blew out my breath and
 looked across the rolling hills and oak woods of our ranch to where the
 Pacific shimmered. I thought, ""All this and three volplas, too.""


 I wiped the back of my hand across my mouth and said aloud, ""Yes, sir,
 the dangerous age. And, lady, I'm going to have fun.""


 My wife sighed patiently.


 I walked over and put the arm that held the beer bottle around her
 shoulder and chucked her chin up with my other hand. The golden sun
 danced in her blue eyes. I watched that light in her beautiful eyes and
 said, ""But you're the only one I'm dangerous about.""


 I kissed her until I heard rollerskates coming across the terrace from
 one direction and a horse galloping toward the terrace from the other
 direction.


 ""You have lovely lips,"" I whispered.


 ""Thanks. Yours deserve the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, too.""


 Our son reared the new palomino I had just bought him for his
 fourteenth birthday and yelled down, ""Unhand that maiden, Burrhead, or
 I'll give you lead poisoning.""


 I laughed and picked up my plate and sat down in a chair. My wife
 brought me a bowl of salad and I munched the hamburger and watched the
 boy unsaddle the horse and slap it away to the pasture.


 I thought, ""By God, wouldn't he have a fit if he knew what I have back
 there in that lab! Wouldn't they all!""


 The boy carried the saddle up onto the terrace and dropped it. ""Mom,
 I'd like a swim before I eat."" He started undressing.


 ""You
look
as though a little water might help,"" she agreed, sitting
 down next to me with her plate.


 The girl was yanking off her skates. ""And I want one.""


 ""All right. But go in the house and put on your swim suit.""


 ""Oh,
Mother
. Why?""


 ""Because, dear, I said so.""


 The boy had already raced across the terrace and jack-knifed into the
 pool. The cool sound of the dive sent the girl scurrying for her suit.


 I looked at my wife. ""What's the idea?""


 ""She's going to be a young woman soon.""


 ""Is that any reason for wearing clothes? Look at him. He's a young
man
sooner than already.""


 ""Well, if you feel that way about it, they'll both have to start
 wearing clothes.""


 I gulped the last of my hamburger and washed it down with the beer.
 ""This place is going to hell,"" I complained. ""The old man isn't allowed
 to pinch the maid and the kids can't go naked."" I leaned toward her and
 smacked her cheek. ""But the food and the old woman are still the best.""


 ""Say, what goes with you? You've been grinning like a happy ape ever
 since you came out of the lab.""


 ""I told you—""


 ""Oh, not that again! You were dangerous at any age.""


 I stood up and put my plate aside and bent over her. ""Just the same,
 I'm going to have a new kind of fun.""
She reached up and grabbed my ear. She narrowed her eyes and put a mock
 grimness on her lips.


 ""It's a joke,"" I assured her. ""I'm going to play a tremendous joke on
 the whole world. I've only had the feeling once before in a small way,
 but I've always....""


 She twisted my ear and narrowed her eyes even more. ""Like?""


 ""Well, when my old man was pumping his first fortune out of some oil
 wells in Oklahoma, we lived down there. Outside this little town, I
 found a litter of flat stones that had young black-snakes under each
 slab. I filled a pail with them and took them into town and dumped them
 on the walk in front of the movie just as Theda Bara's matinee let out.
 The best part was that no one had seen me do it. They just couldn't
 understand how so many snakes got there. I learned how great it can be
 to stand around quietly and watch people encounter the surprise that
 you have prepared for them.""


 She let go of my ear. ""Is that the kind of fun you're going to have?""


 ""Yep.""


 She shook her head. ""Did I say you are
eccentric
?""


 I grinned. ""Forgive me if I eat and run, dear. Something in the lab
 can't wait.""


 The fact was that I had something more in the lab than I had bargained
 for. I had aimed only at a gliding mammal a little more efficient than
 the Dusky Glider of Australia, a marsupial. Even in the basically
 mutating colony, there had been a decidedly simian appearance in recent
 years, a long shift from the garbage-dump rats I had started with. But
 my first volplas were shockingly humanoid.


 They were also much faster than had been their predecessors in
 organizing their nervous activity after the slumbrous explosion of
 growth in the metabolic accelerator. When I returned to the lab, they
 were already moving about on the mattress and the male was trying to
 stand.


 He was a little the larger and stood twenty-eight inches high. Except
 for the face, chest and belly, they were covered with a soft, almost
 golden down. Where it was bare of this golden fur, the skin was pink.
 On their heads and across the shoulders of the male stood a shock of
 fur as soft as chinchilla. The faces were appealingly humanoid, except
 that the eyes were large and nocturnal. The cranium was in the same
 proportion to the body as it is in the human.
When the male spread his arms, the span was forty-eight inches. I held
 his arms out and tried to tease the spars open. They were not new. The
 spars had been common to the basic colony for years and were the result
 of serial mutations effecting those greatly elongated fifth fingers
 that had first appeared in Nijinsky. No longer jointed like a finger,
 the spar turned backward sharply and ran alongside the wrist almost to
 the elbow. Powerful wrist muscles could snap it outward and forward.
 Suddenly, as I teased the male volpla, this happened.


 The spars added nine inches on each side to his span. As they swept out
 and forward, the lateral skin that had, till now, hung in resting folds
 was tightened in a golden plane that stretched from the tip of the spar
 to his waist and continued four inches wide down his legs to where it
 anchored at the little toe.


 This was by far the most impressive plane that had appeared till now.
 It was a true gliding plane, perhaps even a soaring one. I felt a
 thrill run along my back.


 By four o'clock that afternoon, I was feeding them solid food and, with
 the spars closed, they were holding little cups and drinking water from
 them in a most humanlike way. They were active, curious, playful and
 decidedly amorous.


 Their humanoid qualities were increasingly apparent. There was a lumbar
 curvature and buttocks. The shoulder girdle and pectoral muscles were
 heavy and out of proportion, of course, yet the females had only one
 pair of breasts. The chin and jaw were humanlike instead of simian and
 the dental equipment was appropriate to this structure. What this
 portended was brought home to me with a shock.


 I was kneeling on the mattress, cuffing and roughing the male as one
 might a puppy dog, when one of the females playfully climbed up my
 back. I reached around and brought her over my shoulder and sat her
 down. I stroked the soft fur on her head and said, ""Hello, pretty one.
 Hello.""


 The male watched me, grinning.


 He said, ""'Ello, 'ello.""
As I walked into the kitchen, giddy with this enormous joke, my wife
 said, ""Guy and Em are flying up for dinner. That rocket of Guy's they
 launched in the desert yesterday was a success. It pulled Guy up to
 Cloud Nine and he wants to celebrate.""


 I danced a little jig the way old Nijinsky might do it. ""Oh, great!
 Oh, wonderful! Good old Guy! Everybody's a success. It's great. It's
 wonderful. Success on success!""


 I danced into the kitchen table and tipped over a basket of green corn.
 The maid promptly left the kitchen for some other place.


 My wife just stared at me. ""Have you been drinking the lab alcohol?""


 ""I've been drinking the nectar of the gods. My Hera, you're properly
 married to Zeus. I've my own little Greeks descended from Icarus.""


 She pretended a hopeless sag of her pretty shoulders. ""Wouldn't you
 just settle for a worldly martini?""


 ""I will, yes. But first a divine kiss.""


 I sipped at my martini and lounged in a terrace chair watching the
 golden evening slant across the beautiful hills of our ranch. I
 dreamed. I would invent a euphonious set of words to match the Basic
 English vocabulary and teach it to them as their language. They would
 have their own crafts and live in small tree houses.


 I would teach them legends: that they had come from the stars, that
 they had subsequently watched the first red men and then the first
 white men enter these hills.


 When they were able to take care of themselves, I would turn them
 loose. There would be volpla colonies all up and down the Coast before
 anyone suspected. One day, somebody would see a volpla. The newspapers
 would laugh.


 Then someone authoritative would find a colony and observe them. He
 would conclude, ""I am convinced that they have a language and speak it
 intelligently.""


 The government would issue denials. Reporters would ""expose the truth""
 and ask, ""Where have these aliens come from?"" The government would
 reluctantly admit the facts. Linguists would observe at close quarters
 and learn the simple volpla language. Then would come the legends.


 Volpla wisdom would become a cult—and of all forms of comedy, cults, I
 think, are the funniest.
""Darling, are you listening to me?"" my wife asked with impatient
 patience.


 ""What? Sure. Certainly.""


 ""You didn't hear a word. You just sit there and grin into space."" She
 got up and poured me another martini. ""Here, maybe this will sober you
 up.""


 I pointed. ""That's probably Guy and Em.""


 A 'copter sidled over the ridge, then came just above the oak woods
 toward us. Guy set it gently on the landing square and we walked down
 to meet them.


 I helped Em out and hugged her. Guy jumped out, asking, ""Do you have
 your TV set on?""


 ""No,"" I answered. ""Should I?""


 ""It's almost time for the broadcast. I was afraid we would miss it.""


 ""What broadcast?""


 ""From the rocket.""


 ""Rocket?""


 ""For heaven's sake, darling,"" my wife complained, ""I told you about
 Guy's rocket being a success. The papers are full of it. So are the
 broadcasts.""


 As we stepped up on the terrace, she turned to Guy and Em. ""He's out of
 contact today. Thinks he's Zeus.""


 I asked our son to wheel a TV set out onto the terrace while I made
 martinis for our friends. Then we sat down and drank the cocktails and
 the kids had fruit juice and we watched the broadcast Guy had tuned in.


 Some joker from Cal Tech was explaining diagrams of a multi-stage
 rocket.


 After a bit, I got up and said, ""I have something out in the lab I want
 to check on.""


 ""Hey, wait a minute,"" Guy objected. ""They're about to show the shots of
 the launching.""


 My wife gave me a look; you know the kind. I sat down. Then I got up
 and poured myself another martini and freshened Em's up, too. I sat
 down again.


 The scene had changed to a desert launching site. There was old Guy
 himself explaining that when he pressed the button before him, the
 hatch on the third stage of the great rocket in the background would
 close and, five minutes later, the ship would fire itself.


 Guy, on the screen, pushed the button, and I heard Guy, beside me, give
 a sort of little sigh. We watched the hatch slowly close.


 ""You look real good,"" I said. ""A regular Space Ranger. What are you
 shooting at?""


 ""Darling, will you please—be—
quiet
?""


 ""Yeah, Dad. Can it, will you? You're always gagging around.""
On the screen, Guy's big dead-earnest face was explaining more about
 the project and suddenly I realized that this was an instrument-bearing
 rocket they hoped to land on the Moon. It would broadcast from there.
 Well, now—say, that
would
be something! I began to feel a little
 ashamed of the way I had been acting and I reached out and slapped old
 Guy on the shoulder. For just a moment, I thought of telling him about
 my volplas. But only for a moment.


 A ball of flame appeared at the base of the rocket. Miraculously, the
 massive tower lifted, seemed for a moment merely to stand there on a
 flaming pillar, then was gone.


 The screen returned to a studio, where an announcer explained that the
 film just shown had been taken day before yesterday. Since then, the
 rocket's third stage was known to have landed successfully at the south
 shore of Mare Serenitatis. He indicated the location on a large lunar
 map behind him.


 ""From this position, the telemeter known as Rocket Charlie will be
 broadcasting scientific data for several months. But now, ladies and
 gentlemen, we will clear the air for Rocket Charlie's only general
 broadcast. Stand by for Rocket Charlie.""


 A chronometer appeared on the screen and, for several seconds, there
 was silence.


 I heard my boy whisper, ""Uncle Guy, this is the biggest!""


 My wife said, ""Em, I think I'll just faint.""


 Suddenly there was a lunar landscape on the screen, looking just as
 it's always been pictured. A mechanical voice cut in.


 ""This is Rocket Charlie saying, 'Hello, Earth,' from my position in
 Mare Serenitatis. First I will pan the Menelaus Mountains for fifteen
 seconds. Then I will focus my camera on Earth for five seconds.""


 The camera began to move and the mountains marched by, stark and
 awesomely wild. Toward the end of the movement, the shadow of the
 upright third stage appeared in the foreground.


 Abruptly the camera made a giddy swing, focused a moment, and we were
 looking at Earth. At that time, there was no Moon over California. It
 was Africa and Europe we were looking at.


 ""This is Rocket Charlie saying, 'Good-by, Earth.'""


 Well, when that screen went dead, there was pandemonium around our
 terrace. Big old Guy was so happy, he was wiping tears from his eyes.
 The women were kissing him and hugging him. Everybody was yelling at
 once.
I used the metabolic accelerator to cut the volplas' gestation down to
 one week. Then I used it to bring the infants to maturity in one month.
 I had luck right off. Quite by accident, the majority of the early
 infants were females, which sped things up considerably.


 By the next spring, I had a colony of over a hundred volplas and I shut
 down the accelerator. From now on, they could have babies in their own
 way.


 I had devised the language for them, using Basic English as my model,
 and during the months while every female was busy in the metabolic
 accelerator, I taught the language to the males. They spoke it softly
 in high voices and the eight hundred words didn't seem to tax their
 little skulls a bit.


 My wife and the kids went down to Santa Barbara for a week and I took
 the opportunity to slip the oldest of the males and his two females out
 of the lab.


 I put them in the jeep beside me and drove to a secluded little valley
 about a mile back in the ranch.


 They were all three wide-eyed at the world and jabbered continuously.
 They kept me busy relating their words for ""tree,"" ""rock,"" ""sky"" to the
 objects. They had a little trouble with ""sky.""


 Until I had them out in the open country, it had been impossible to
 appreciate fully what lovely little creatures they were. They blended
 perfectly with the California landscape. Occasionally, when they raised
 their arms, the spars would open and spread those glorious planes.


 Almost two hours went by before the male made it into the air. His
 playful curiosity about the world had been abandoned momentarily and he
 was chasing one of the girls. As usual, she was anxious to be caught
 and stopped abruptly at the bottom of a little knoll.


 He probably meant to dive for her. But when he spread his arms, the
 spars snapped out and those golden planes sheared into the air. He
 sailed over her in a stunning sweep. Then he rose up and up until he
 hung in the breeze for a long moment, thirty feet above the ground.


 He turned a plaintive face back to me, dipped worriedly and skimmed
 straight for a thorn bush. He banked instinctively, whirled toward us
 in a golden flash and crashed with a bounce to the grass.


 The two girls reached him before I did and stroked and fussed over him
 so that I could not get near. Suddenly he laughed with a shrill little
 whoop. After that, it was a carnival.
They learned quickly and brilliantly. They were not fliers; they were
 gliders and soarers. Before long, they took agilely to the trees and
 launched themselves in beautiful glides for hundreds of feet, banking,
 turning and spiraling to a gentle halt.


 I laughed out loud with anticipation. Wait till the first pair of these
 was brought before a sheriff! Wait till reporters from the
Chronicle
motored out into the hills to witness this!


 Of course, the volplas didn't want to return to the lab. There was a
 tiny stream through there and at one point it formed a sizable pool.
 They got into this and splashed their long arms about and they scrubbed
 each other. Then they got out and lay on their backs with the planes
 stretched to dry.


 I watched them affectionately and wondered about the advisability of
 leaving them out here. Well, it had to be done sometime. Nothing I
 could tell them about surviving would help them as much as a little
 actual surviving. I called the male over to me.


 He came and squatted, conference fashion, the elbows resting on the
 ground, the wrists crossed at his chest. He spoke first.


 ""Before the red men came, did we live here?""


 ""You lived in places like this all along these mountains. Now there
 are very few of you left. Since you have been staying at my place, you
 naturally have forgotten the ways of living outdoors.""


 ""We can learn again. We want to stay here."" His little face was so
 solemn and thoughtful that I reached out and stroked the fur on his
 head reassuringly.


 We both heard the whir of wings overhead. Two mourning doves flew
 across the stream and landed in an oak on the opposite hillside.


 I pointed. ""There's your food, if you can kill it.""


 He looked at me. ""How?""


 ""I don't think you can get at them in the tree. You'll have to soar up
 above and catch one of them on the wing when they fly away. Think you
 can get up that high?""


 He looked around slowly at the breeze playing in the branches and
 dancing along the hillside grass. It was as if he had been flying a
 thousand years and was bringing antique wisdom to bear. ""I can get up
 there. I can stay for a while. How long will they be in the tree?""


 ""Chances are they won't stay long. Keep your eye on the tree in case
 they leave while you are climbing.""
He ran to a nearby oak and clambered aloft. Presently he launched
 himself, streaked down-valley a way and caught a warm updraft on a
 hillside. In no time, he was up about two hundred feet. He began
 criss-crossing the ridge, working his way back to us.


 The two girls were watching him intently. They came over to me
 wonderingly, stopping now and then to watch him. When they were
 standing beside me, they said nothing. They shaded their eyes with
 tiny hands and watched him as he passed directly above us at about two
 hundred and fifty feet. One of the girls, with her eyes fast on his
 soaring planes, reached out and grasped my sleeve tightly.


 He flashed high above the stream and hung behind the crest of the hill
 where the doves rested. I heard their mourning from the oak tree. It
 occurred to me they would not leave that safety while the hawklike
 silhouette of the volpla marred the sky so near.


 I took the girl's hand from my sleeve and spoke to her, pointing as I
 did so. ""He is going to catch a bird. The bird is in that tree. You
 can make the bird fly so that he can catch it. Look here."" I got up and
 found a stick. ""Can you do this?""
I threw the stick up into a tree near us. Then I found her a stick. She
 threw it better than I had expected.


 ""Good, pretty one. Now run across the stream and up to that tree and
 throw a stick into it.""


 She climbed skillfully into the tree beside us and launched herself
 across the stream. She swooped up the opposite hillside and landed
 neatly in the tree where the doves rested.


 The birds came out of the tree, climbing hard with their graceful
 strokes.


 I looked back, as did the girl remaining beside me. The soaring volpla
 half closed his planes and started dropping. He became a golden flash
 across the sky.


 The doves abruptly gave up their hard climbing and fell away with
 swiftly beating wings. I saw one of the male volpla's planes open a
 little. He veered giddily in the new direction and again dropped like a
 molten arrow.


 The doves separated and began to zigzag down the valley. The volpla did
 something I would not have anticipated—he opened his planes and shot
 lower than the bird he was after, then swept up and intercepted the
 bird's crossward flight.


 I saw the planes close momentarily. Then they opened again and the bird
 plummeted to a hillside. The volpla landed gently atop the hill and
 stood looking back at us.


 The volpla beside me danced up and down shrieking in a language all her
 own. The girl who had raised the birds from the tree volplaned back to
 us, yammering like a bluejay.
It was a hero's welcome. He had to walk back, of course—he had no
 way to carry such a load in flight. The girls glided out to meet
 him. Their lavish affection held him up for a time, but eventually he
 strutted in like every human hunter.


 They were raptly curious about the bird. They poked at it, marveled at
 its feathers and danced about it in an embryonic rite of the hunt. But
 presently the male turned to me.


 ""We
eat
this?""


 I laughed and took his tiny, four-fingered hand. In a sandy spot
 beneath a great tree that overhung the creek, I built a small fire for
 them. This was another marvel, but first I wanted to teach them how to
 clean the bird. I showed them how to spit it and turn it over their
 fire.


 Later, I shared a small piece of the meat in their feast. They were
 gleeful and greasily amorous during the meal.


 When I had to leave, it was dark. I warned them to stand watches, keep
 the fire burning low and take to the tree above if anything approached.
 The male walked a little away with me when I left the fire.


 I said again, ""Promise me you won't leave here until we've made you
 ready for it.""


 ""We like it here. We will stay. Tomorrow you bring more of us?""


 ""Yes. I will bring many more of you, if you promise to keep them all
 here in this woods until they're ready to leave.""


 ""I promise."" He looked up at the night sky and, in the firelight, I saw
 his wonder. ""You say we came from there?""


 ""The old ones of your kind told me so. Didn't they tell you?""


 ""I can't remember any old ones. You tell me.""


 ""The old ones told me you came long before the red men in a ship from
 the stars."" Standing there in the dark, I had to grin, visioning the
 Sunday supplements that would be written in about a year, maybe even
 less.


 He looked into the sky for a long time. ""Those little lights are the
 stars?""


 ""That's right.""


 ""Which star?""


 I glanced about and presently pointed over a tree. ""From Venus."" Then
 I realized I had blundered by passing him an English name. ""In your
 language, Pohtah.""


 He looked at the planet a long time and murmured, ""Venus. Pohtah.""
That next week, I transported all of the volplas out to the oak woods.
 There were a hundred and seven men, women and children. With no design
 on my part, they tended to segregate into groups consisting of four to
 eight couples together with the current children of the women. Within
 these groups, the adults were promiscuous, but apparently not outside
 the group. The group thus had the appearance of a super-family and the
 males indulged and cared for all the children without reference to
 actual parenthood.


 By the end of the week, these super-families were scattered over
 about four square miles of the ranch. They had found a new delicacy,
 sparrows, and hunted them easily as they roosted at night. I had taught
 the volplas to use the fire drill and they were already utilizing the
 local grasses, vines and brush to build marvelously contrived tree
 houses in which the young, and sometimes the adults, slept through
 midday and midnight.


 The afternoon my family returned home, I had a crew of workmen out
 tearing down the animal rooms and lab building. The caretakers
 had anesthetized all the experimental mutants, and the metabolic
 accelerator and other lab equipment was being dismantled. I wanted
 nothing around that might connect the sudden appearance of the volplas
 with my property. It was already apparent that it would take the
 volplas only a few more weeks to learn their means of survival and
 develop an embryonic culture of their own. Then they could leave my
 ranch and the fun would be on.


 My wife got out of the car and looked around at the workmen hurrying
 about the disemboweled buildings and she said, ""What on Earth is going
 on here?""


 ""I've finished my work and we no longer need the buildings. I'm going
 to write a paper about my results.""


 My wife looked at me appraisingly and shook her head. ""I thought you
 meant it. But you really ought to. It would be your first.""


 My son asked, ""What happened to the animals?""


 ""Turned them over to the university for further study,"" I lied.


 ""Well,"" he said to her, ""you can't say our pop isn't a man of decision.""


 Twenty-four hours later, there wasn't a sign of animal experimentation
 on the ranch.


 Except, of course, that the woods were full of volplas. At night, I
 could hear them faintly when I sat out on the terrace. As they passed
 through the dark overhead, they chattered and laughed and sometimes
 moaned in winged love. One night a flight of them soared slowly across
 the face of the full Moon, but I was the only one who noticed.

         Charles Murray is a publicity genius, and the publication of his and Richard Herrnstein's book, The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life , in the fall of 1994 was his masterpiece. 

         Virtually all ambitious trade hardcover books are preceded by an edition of 100 to 200 flimsy ""galley proofs."" These are sent out to people who might generate buzz for the book: blurbists, bookers for television talk shows, editors, and--most important--book critics. There is an ethos of letting the chips fall where they may about the sending out of galleys: Now the book will begin to receive uncontrolled reaction. (For example, back in 1991, Murray somehow got hold of the galleys of my own last book, and wrote me heatedly denying that he was working on a book about black genetic intellectual inferiority, as I had asserted. I left the passage in, but softened it.) 

         The Bell Curve was not circulated in galleys before publication. The effect was, first, to increase the allure of the book (There must be something really hot in there!), and second, to ensure that no one inclined to be skeptical would be able to weigh in at the moment of publication. The people who had galley proofs were handpicked by Murray and his publisher. The ordinary routine of neutral reviewers having a month or two to go over the book with care did not occur. Another handpicked group was flown to Washington at the expense of the American Enterprise Institute and given a weekend-long personal briefing on the book's contents by Murray himself (Herrnstein had died very recently), just before publication. The result was what you'd expect: The first wave of publicity was either credulous or angry, but short on evidence, because nobody had had time to digest and evaluate the book carefully. 

                         The Bell Curve isn't a typical work of trade nonfiction. It is gotten up as a work of original scholarly research. Most works containing fresh regression analysis and historical argument from primary sources would be published in academic quarterlies that send manuscripts out for elaborate, lengthy evaluation before deciding whether to publish them. Herrnstein and Murray didn't do this, so it wasn't until a full year or more after The Bell Curve was published that the leading experts on its subject had a chance to go through the underlying data with care. Therefore, as time went on, the knowledgeability of the Bell Curve discussion grew, but the attention paid to that discussion inevitably shrank. 

         The debate on publication day was conducted in the mass media by people with no independent ability to assess the book. Over the next few months, intellectuals took some pretty good shots at it in smaller publications like the New Republic and the New York Review of Books . It wasn't until late 1995 that the most damaging criticism of The Bell Curve began to appear, in tiny academic journals. What follows is a brief summary of that last body of work. The Bell Curve , it turns out, is full of mistakes ranging from sloppy reasoning to mis-citations of sources to outright mathematical errors. Unsurprisingly, all the mistakes are in the direction of supporting the authors' thesis. 

          First, a quick prÃ©cis of The Bell Curve . IQ tests, according to Murray and Herrnstein, measure an essential human quality, general intelligence. During the second half of the 20 th century, this quality has risen to supreme importance, because society has become increasingly complex. The intelligent have therefore gone through an ""invisible migration,"" from points of origin all over the class system to a concentration at the top of business, government, and the professions. They are likely to become ever more dominant and prosperous. The unintelligent are falling further and further behind. Because intelligence is substantially inherited, nothing is likely to reverse this process. Blacks are overrepresented among the unintelligent. Any efforts government might make to improve the economic opportunities of poor people, especially poor black people, are likely to fail, because their poverty is so much the result of inherited low intelligence. About the best that can be done for these people is an effort to create a world of simple, decent, honorable toil for them. 

          Herrnstein and Murray begin by telling us that the liberal position on IQ--namely, ""Intelligence is a bankrupt concept""--has been discredited, and that ""a scholarly consensus has been reached"" around their position. This consensus is ""beyond significant technical dispute."" Thus, by the end of their introduction, they have arranged matters so that if intelligence has any meaning at all, the idiotic liberals stand discredited; and meanwhile, extremely broad claims for intelligence have the cover of ""consensus."" 

         The notion that IQ tests are completely useless never prevailed in liberal academia to nearly the extent that Herrnstein and Murray say. A more accurate rendering of the liberal position would be that rather than a single ""general intelligence,"" there are a handful of crucial--and separate--mental abilities; that none of these abilities is important enough to obviate the role of family background and education; and that native ability (and economic success independent of native ability) can be enhanced by improving education, training, and public health. The Bell Curve refers in passing to some of these points, but on the whole it sets up a cartoon-left position as its (easy) target. Meanwhile, the psychometricians who dominate the footnotes of The Bell Curve are John Hunter, Arthur Jensen, Malcolm Ree, and Frank Schmidt. These men are well known within the field as representing its right wing, not a mainstream consensus. 

         The next problem with The Bell Curve 's thesis is in the idea of the rise to dominance of the cognitive elite. To the book's initial audience of Ivy Leaguers, this idea seemed valid on its face. Everybody knows that the best universities, law firms, hospitals, investment banks, and the State Department used to be run by preppies whose main virtue was fortunate birth, and are now open to one and all on the basis of merit. 

          But the larger premise--that intelligent people used to be scattered throughout the class structure, and are now concentrated at the top--is almost impossible to prove, simply because the mass administration of mental tests is such a recent phenomenon. High scorers on mental tests do ""bunch up"" (as Herrnstein and Murray put it) in elite-university student bodies. But this is tautological: Any group selected on the basis of scores on mental tests will be composed disproportionately of people who score high on mental tests. Proving The Bell Curve 's thesis would require proving that success increasingly correlates with IQ in areas of life where mental tests are not the explicit gatekeepers. To see how The Bell Curve tries and fails to get around these inherent problems, see and . 

         Having conditioned its audience to view IQ as all-important, The Bell Curve then manipulates statistics in a way that makes IQ look bigger, and everything else smaller, in determining Americans' life-chances. 

         The basic tool of statistical social science in general, and of The Bell Curve in particular, is regression analysis, a technique used to assign weights to various factors (called ""independent variables"") in determining a final outcome (called the ""dependent variable""). The original statistical work in The Bell Curve consists of regression analyses on a database called the National Longitudinal Study of Youth. The authors claim to demonstrate that high IQ is more predictive of economic success than any other factor, and that low IQ is more predictive of poverty and social breakdown. Virtually all the early commentators on The Bell Curve were unable to assess the merits of the regression analysis. ""I am not a scientist. I know nothing about psychometrics,"" wrote Leon Wieseltier (who was otherwise quite critical) in a typical disclaimer. 

         But by now the statistics have been gone over by professionals, who have come up with different results. The key points of their critique of The Bell Curve are as follows: 

         What Herrnstein and Murray used to measure IQ is actually a measure of education as well as intelligence. All the people tracked in the National Longitudinal Study of Youth took the Armed Forces Qualifying Test, which Herrnstein and Murray treat as a good measure of intelligence. Because the material covered in the test includes subjects like trigonometry, many academic critics of The Bell Curve have objected to its use as a measure only of IQ and not at all of academic achievement. Herrnstein and Murray concede in the footnotes that scores tend to rise with the subjects' education--but they seriously underestimate the magnitude of this rise, as shows. And they resist the obvious inference that the test scores are measuring something other than intelligence. 

         Most of The Bell Curve 's analysis is devoted to proving that IQ has more predictive power than parental ""socio-economic status."" But Herrnstein and Murray's method of figuring socioeconomic status seems designed to low-ball its influence, as explains. 

         Herrnstein and Murray begin their discussion of the National Longitudinal Study of Youth data by announcing that they aren't going to analyze the effect of education, because education is too much a result of IQ. It's not an independent variable. (Of course, according to their theory, socioeconomic status is also a result of IQ, but somehow, that doesn't stop them.) Therefore, what you'd most want to know from a policy standpoint--how much education can increase opportunity--isn't dealt with in the book, except in two obscure footnotes. Both would seem to support the liberal, pro-education position that Herrnstein and Murray say is futile. One footnote shows education increasing IQ year by year. The other shows a higher correlation between college degree and family income than between IQ and family income. 

         One of The Bell Curve 's theoretical linchpins is the high heritability of IQ. Herrnstein and Murray, sounding like the souls of caution, write that ""half a century of work, now amounting to hundreds of empirical and theoretical studies, permits a broad conclusion that the genetic component of IQ is unlikely to be smaller than 40 per cent or higher than 80 per cent. ... For purposes of this discussion, we will adopt a middling estimate of 60 per cent heritability."" This now looks seriously overstated. Michael Daniels, Bernie Devlin, and Kathryn Roeder of Carnegie Mellon University took the same studies on which Herrnstein and Murray based their estimate, and subjected them to a computer meta-analysis (""a powerful method of statistical analysis""-- The Bell Curve ). Their paper, which has not yet been published, says: ""In brief, studies of IQ, and our reanalyses of them, suggest a narrow-sense heritability of 34 per cent and a broad-sense heritability of 46 per cent. [The difference between broad and narrow is too technical to explain in this limited space.] This is a far cry from Herrnstein and Murray's maximum value of 80 per cent or their middling value of 60 per cent. Consequently, Herrnstein and Murray give the impression that IQ is highly 'heritable,' but it is not."" 

         If the purpose of the whole exercise is to figure out what our social policies should be, then, ""Which is more predictive, IQ or socioeconomic status?"" isn't the essential question anyway. Making it the essential question avoids the issue of whether IQ is really so massively predictive that it drowns out everything else. (Herrnstein and Murray mostly leave the evidence for this, their central contention, to footnotes. The figures they offer are far from dispositive.) 

         The chapter of The Bell Curve on policies that might be able to overcome the fate of a low IQ focuses mainly on whether early-childhood programs like Head Start (most of which aren't run with raising IQ as their primary goal) can raise IQ significantly over the long term, and sorrowfully concludes that they can't. What the book doesn't discuss is whether public schools--by far the biggest government social program--can raise IQ, or earnings after you control for IQ. As James Heckman of the University of Chicago wrote in the Journal of Political Economy , "" Evidence of a genetic component to skills has no bearing on the efficacy of any social policy. ... The relevant issue is the cost effectiveness of the intervention."" (As an example of where the kind of analysis Herrnstein and Murray didn't do can lead, a new study by Jay Girotto and Paul Peterson of Harvard shows that students who raise their grades and take harder courses can increase their IQ scores by an average of eight points during the first three years of high school.) 

          At the beginning of The Bell Curve , Herrnstein and Murray declare that ""the concept of intelligence has taken on a much higher place in the pantheon of human virtues than it deserves."" And they claim that their view of IQ tests is ""squarely in the middle of the scientific road."" They end by expressing the hope that we can ""be a society that makes good on the fundamental promise of the American tradition: the opportunity for everyone, not just the lucky ones, to live a satisfying life."" Throughout, Herrnstein and Murray consistently present themselves as fair- (or even liberal-) minded technicians who have, with great caution, followed the evidence where it leads--which, unfortunately, is to a few unassailable if unpleasant scientific truths that it is their reluctant duty to report. 

         In fact, The Bell Curve is a relentless brief for the conservative position in psychometrics and social policy. For all its talk of reflecting a consensus, the sources it draws upon are heavily skewed to the right. Herrnstein and Murray used quasi-nutty studies that support their position (as Charles Lane demonstrated in the New York Review of Books ), and ignore mainstream studies that contradict it (as Richard Nisbett showed in the New Republic ). The data in The Bell Curve are consistently massaged to produce conservative conclusions; not once is a finding that contradicts the main thesis reported in the text. ( shows how Herrnstein and Murray have made the convergence in black-white IQ scores, which they claim to find ""encouraging,"" look smaller than it actually is.) The Bell Curve 's air of strict scientism doesn't preclude the use of lightly sourced or unsourced assertions, such as the statement that the median IQ of all black Africans is 75, or that ""intermarriage among people in the top few percentiles of intelligence may be increasing far more rapidly than suspected"" (no footnote). Though they piously claim not to be doing so, Herrnstein and Murray leave readers with the distinct impression that IQ is the cause of economic success and failure, and that genetic difference explains the black-white IQ gap. 

         In the most famous passage in The Republic , Plato describes an underground cave where people are held prisoner in chains, unable to see anything but the shadows cast by figures passing outside; they mistake the shadows for reality. The Republic is probably the first place in history where an idea like that of Murray and Herrnstein's cognitive elite appears. Plato believed that through education, people could leave the cave and be able to see the truth instead of the shadows, thus fitting themselves to become the wise rulers of society. But he was quick to insert a cautionary note: Those who have left the cave might be tempted to think they can see perfectly clearly, while actually they would be ""dazzled by excess of light."" The image applies to The Bell Curve : Presented as an exact representation of reality, in opposition to the shadows of political correctness, it actually reflects the blinkered vision of one part of the American elite. It constantly tells these people that they are naturally superior, and offers lurid descriptions of aspects of national life that they know about only by rumor. Readers who accept The Bell Curve as tough-minded and realistic, and who assume that all criticism of it is ignorant and ideologically motivated, are not as far removed from Plato's cave as they might think.

MOTHER GOOSE
Dr. David Lessing found Jack Dorffman and the boy waiting in his office
 when he arrived at the Hoffman Center that morning. Dorffman looked as
 though he'd been running all night. There were dark pouches under his
 eyes; his heavy unshaven face seemed to sag at every crease. Lessing
 glanced sharply at his Field Director and sank down behind his desk
 with a sigh. ""All right, Jack—what's wrong?""


 ""This kid is driving me nuts,"" said Dorffman through clenched teeth.
 ""He's gone completely hay-wire. Nobody's been able to get near him
 for three weeks, and now at six o'clock this morning he decides he's
 leaving the Farm. I talk to him, I sweat him down, I do everything but
 tie him to the bed, and I waste my time. He's leaving the Farm. Period.""


 ""So you bring him down here,"" said Lessing sourly. ""The worst place he
 could be, if something's really wrong."" He looked across at the boy.
 ""Tommy? Come over and sit down.""


 There was nothing singular about the boy's appearance. He was thin,
 with a pale freckled face and the guileless expression of any normal
 eight-year-old as he blinked across the desk at Lessing. The awkward
 grey monitor-helmet concealed a shock of sandy hair. He sat with a mute
 appeal in his large grey eyes as Lessing flipped the reader-switch and
 blinked in alarm at the wildly thrashing pattern on the tape.


 The boy was terrorized. He was literally pulsating with fear.


 Lessing sat back slowly. ""Tell me about it, Tommy,"" he said gently.


 ""I don't want to go back to the Farm,"" said the boy.


 ""Why?""


 ""I just don't. I hate it there.""


 ""Are you frightened?""


 The boy bit his lip and nodded slowly.


 ""Of me? Of Dr. Dorffman?""


 ""No. Oh, no!""


 ""Then what?""


 Again the mute appeal in the boy's eyes. He groped for words, and none
 came. Finally he said, ""If I could only take this off—"" He fingered
 the grey plastic helmet.


 ""You think
that
would make you feel better?""


 ""It would, I know it would.""


 Lessing shook his head. ""I don't think so, Tommy. You know what the
 monitor is for, don't you?""


 ""It stops things from going out.""


 ""That's right. And it stops things from going in. It's an insulator.
 You need it badly. It would hurt you a great deal if you took it off,
 away from the Farm.""


 The boy fought back tears. ""But I don't want to go back there—"" The
 fear-pattern was alive again on the tape. ""I don't feel good there. I
 never want to go back.""


 ""Well, we'll see. You can stay here for a while."" Lessing nodded at
 Dorffman and stepped into an adjoining room with him. ""You say this has
 been going on for
three weeks
?""


 ""I'm afraid so. We thought it was just a temporary pattern—we see so
 much of that up there.""


 ""I know, I know."" Lessing chewed his lip. ""I don't like it. We'd better
 set up a battery on him and try to spot the trouble. And I'm afraid
 you'll have to set it up. I've got that young Melrose from Chicago to
 deal with this morning—the one who's threatening to upset the whole
 Conference next month with some crazy theories he's been playing with.
 I'll probably have to take him out to the Farm to shut him up."" Lessing
 ran a hand through sparse grey hair. ""See what you can do for the boy
 downstairs.""


 ""Full psi precautions?"" asked Dorffman.


 ""Certainly! And Jack—in this case, be
sure
of it. If Tommy's in the
 trouble I think he's in, we don't dare risk a chance of Adult Contact
 now. We could end up with a dead boy on our hands.""
Two letters were waiting on Lessing's desk that morning. The first was
 from Roberts Bros., announcing another shift of deadline on the book,
 and demanding the galley proofs two weeks earlier than scheduled.
 Lessing groaned. As director of psionic research at the Hoffman Medical
 Center, he had long since learned how administrative detail could suck
 up daytime hours. He knew that his real work was at the Farm—yet he
 hadn't even been to the Farm in over six weeks. And now, as the book
 approached publication date, Lessing wondered if he would ever really
 get back to work again.


 The other letter cheered him a bit more. It bore the letterhead of the
 International Psionics Conference:


 Dear Dr. Lessing:


 In recognition of your position as an authority on human Psionic
 behavior patterns, we would be gratified to schedule you as principle
 speaker at the Conference in Chicago on October 12th. A few remarks in
 discussion of your forthcoming book would be entirely in order—


 They were waiting for it, then! He ran the galley proofs into the
 scanner excitedly. They knew he had something up his sleeve. His
 earlier papers had only hinted at the direction he was going—but the
 book would clear away the fog. He scanned the title page proudly. ""A
 Theory of Psionic Influence on Infant and Child Development."" A good
 title—concise, commanding, yet modest. They would read it, all right.
 And they would find it a light shining brightly in the darkness, a
 guide to the men who were floundering in the jungle of a strange and
 baffling new science.


 For they were floundering. When they were finally forced to recognize
 that this great and powerful force did indeed exist in human minds,
 with unimaginable potential if it could only be unlocked, they had
 plunged eagerly into the search, and found themselves in a maddening
 bramble bush of contradictions and chaos. Nothing worked, and
 everything worked too well. They were trying to study phenomena which
 made no sense, observing things that defied logic. Natural laws came
 crashing down about their ears as they stood sadly by and watched
 things happen which natural law said could never happen. They had never
 been in this jungle before, nor in any jungle remotely like it. The
 old rules didn't work here, the old methods of study failed. And the
 more they struggled, the thicker and more impenetrable the bramble bush
 became—


 But now David Lessing had discovered a pathway through that jungle, a
 theory to work by—


 At his elbow the intercom buzzed. ""A gentleman to see you,"" the girl
 said. ""A Dr. Melrose. He's very impatient, sir.""


 He shut off the scanner and said, ""Send him in, please.""
Dr. Peter Melrose was tall and thin, with jet black hair and dark
 mocking eyes. He wore a threadbare sport coat and a slouch. He offered
 Lessing a bony hand, then flung himself into a chair as he stared about
 the office in awe.


 ""I'm really overwhelmed,"" he said after a moment. ""Within the
 stronghold of psionic research at last. And face to face with the
 Master in the trembling flesh!""


 Lessing frowned. ""Dr. Melrose, I don't quite understand—""


 ""Oh, it's just that I'm impressed,"" the young man said airily. ""Of
 course, I've seen old dried-up Authorities before—but never before
 a brand spanking new one, just fresh out of the pupa, so to speak!""
 He touched his forehead in a gesture of reverence. ""I bow before the
 Oracle. Speak, oh Motah, live forever! Cast a pearl at my feet!""


 ""If you've come here to be insulting,"" Lessing said coldly, ""you're
 just wasting time."" He reached for the intercom switch.


 ""I think you'd better wait before you do that,"" Melrose said sharply,
 ""because I'm planning to take you apart at the Conference next month
 unless I like everything I see and hear down here today. And if you
 don't think I can do it, you're in for quite a dumping.""


 Lessing sat back slowly. ""Tell me—just what, exactly, do you want?""


 ""I want to hear this fairy tale you're about to publish in the name of
 'Theory',"" Melrose said. ""I want to see this famous Farm of yours up in
 Connecticut and see for myself how much pressure these experimental
 controls you keep talking about will actually bear. But mostly, I want
 to see just what in psionic hell you're so busy making yourself an
 Authority about."" There was no laughter in the man's sharp brown eyes.


 ""You couldn't touch me with a ten foot pole at this conference,""
 snapped Lessing.


 The other man grinned. ""Try me! We shook you up a little bit last year,
 but you didn't seem to get the idea.""


 ""Last year was different."" Lessing scowled. ""As for our 'fairy tale',
 we happen to have a staggering body of evidence that says that it's
 true.""


 ""If the papers you've already published are a preview, we think it's
 false as Satan.""


 ""And our controls are above suspicion.""


 ""So far, we haven't found any way to set up logical controls,"" said
 Melrose. ""We've done a lot of work on it, too.""


 ""Oh, yes—I've heard about your work. Not bad, really. A little
 misdirected, is all.""


 ""According to your Theory, that is.""


 ""Wildly unorthodox approach to psionics—but at least you're energetic
 enough.""


 ""We haven't been energetic enough to find an orthodox approach that got
 us anywhere. We doubt if you have, either. But maybe we're all wrong.""
 Melrose grinned unpleasantly. ""We're not unreasonable, your Majesty. We
 just ask to be shown. If you dare, that is.""


 Lessing slammed his fist down on the desk angrily. ""Have you got the
 day to take a trip?""


 ""I've got 'til New Year.""


 Lessing shouted for his girl. ""Get Dorffman up here. We're going to the
 Farm this afternoon.""


 The girl nodded, then hesitated. ""But what about your lunch?""


 ""Bother lunch."" He gave Melrose a sidelong glare. ""We've got a guest
 here who's got a lot of words he's going to eat for us....""
Ten minutes later they rode the elevator down to the transit levels
 and boarded the little shuttle car in the terminal below the
 Hoffman Center. They sat in silence as the car dipped down into the
 rapid-transit channels beneath the great city, swinging northward in
 the express circuit through Philadelphia and Camden sectors, surfacing
 briefly in Trenton sector, then dropping underground once again for the
 long pull beneath Newark, Manhattan and Westchester sectors. In less
 than twenty minutes the car surfaced on a Parkway channel and buzzed
 north and east through the verdant Connecticut countryside.


 ""What about Tommy?"" Lessing asked Dorffman as the car sped along
 through the afternoon sun.


 ""I just finished the prelims. He's not cooperating.""


 Lessing ground his teeth. ""I should be running him now instead of
 beating the bushes with this—"" He broke off to glare at young Melrose.


 Melrose grinned. ""I've heard you have quite a place up here.""


 ""It's—unconventional, at any rate,"" Lessing snapped.


 ""Well, that depends on your standards. Sounds like a country day
 school, from what I've heard. According to your papers, you've even
 used conventional statistical analysis on your data from up here.""


 ""Until we had to throw it out. We discovered that what we were trying
 to measure didn't make sense in a statistical analysis.""


 ""Of course, you're sure you were measuring
something
.""


 ""Oh, yes. We certainly were.""


 ""Yet you said that you didn't know what.""


 ""That's right,"" said Lessing. ""We don't.""


 ""And you don't know
why
your instruments measure whatever they're
 measuring."" The Chicago man's face was thoughtful. ""In fact, you can't
 really be certain that your instruments are measuring the children at
 all. It's not inconceivable that the
children
might be measuring the
instruments
, eh?""


 Lessing blinked. ""It's conceivable.""


 ""Mmmm,"" said Melrose. ""Sounds like a real firm foundation to build a
 theory on.""


 ""Why not?"" Lessing growled. ""It wouldn't be the first time the tail
 wagged the dog. The psychiatrists never would have gotten out of their
 rut if somebody hadn't gotten smart and realized that one of their new
 drugs worked better in combatting schizophrenia when the doctor took
 the medicine instead of the patient. That was quite a wall to climb.""


 ""Yes, wasn't it,"" mused Melrose, scratching his bony jaw. ""Only took
 them seventy years to climb it, thanks to a certain man's theories.
 I wonder how long it'll take psionics to crawl out of the pit you're
 digging for it?""


 ""We're not digging any pit,"" Lessing exploded angrily. ""We're
 exploring—nothing more. A phenomenon exists. We've known that, one way
 or another, for centuries. The fact that it doesn't seem to be bound by
 the same sort of natural law we've observed elsewhere doesn't mean that
 it isn't governed by natural law. But how can we define the law? How
 can we define the limits of the phenomenon, for that matter? We can't
 work in the dark forever—we've
got
to have a working hypothesis to
 guide us.""


 ""So you dreamed up this 'tadpole' idea,"" said Melrose sourly.


 ""For a working hypothesis—yes. We've known for a long time that every
 human being has extrasensory potential to one degree or another. Not
 just a few here and there—every single one. It's a differentiating
 quality of the human mind. Just as the ability to think logically in a
 crisis instead of giving way to panic is a differentiating quality.""


 ""Fine,"" said Melrose. ""Great. We can't
prove
that, of course, but
 I'll play along.""


 Lessing glared at him. ""When we began studying this psi-potential, we
 found out some curious things. For one thing, it seemed to be immensely
 more powerful and active in infants and children than in adults.
 Somewhere along the line as a child grows up, something happens. We
 don't know what. We do know that the child's psi-potential gradually
 withdraws deeper and deeper into his mind, burying itself farther and
 farther out of reach, just the way a tadpole's tail is absorbed deeper
 and deeper into the growing frog until there just isn't any tail any
 more."" Lessing paused, packing tobacco into his pipe. ""That's why we
 have the Farm—to try to discover why. What forces that potential
 underground? What buries it so deeply that adult human beings can't get
 at it any more?""


 ""And you think you have an answer,"" said Melrose.


 ""We think we might be near an answer. We have a theory that explains
 the available data.""


 The shuttle car bounced sharply as it left the highway automatics.
 Dorffman took the controls. In a few moments they were skimming through
 the high white gates of the Farm, slowing down at the entrance to a
 long, low building.


 ""All right, young man—come along,"" said Lessing. ""I think we can show
 you our answer.""
In the main office building they donned the close-fitting psionic
 monitors required of all personnel at the Farm. They were of a
 hard grey plastic material, with a network of wiring buried in the
 substance, connected to a simple pocket-sized power source.


 ""The major problem,"" Lessing said, ""has been to shield the children
 from any external psionic stimuli, except those we wished to expose
 them to. Our goal is a perfectly controlled psi environment. The
 monitors are quite effective—a simple Renwick scrambler screen.""


 ""It blocks off all types of psi activity?"" asked Melrose.


 ""As far as we can measure, yes.""


 ""Which may not be very far.""


 Jack Dorffman burst in: ""What Dr. Lessing is saying is that they seem
 effective for our purposes.""


 ""But you don't know why,"" added Melrose.


 ""All right, we don't know why. Nobody knows why a Renwick screen
 works—why blame us?"" They were walking down the main corridor and out
 through an open areaway. Behind the buildings was a broad playground. A
 baseball game was in progress in one corner; across the field a group
 of swings, slides, ring bars and other playground paraphernalia was in
 heavy use. The place was teeming with youngsters, all shouting in a
 fury of busy activity. Occasionally a helmeted supervisor hurried by;
 one waved to them as she rescued a four-year-old from the parallel bars.


 They crossed into the next building, where classes were in progress.
 ""Some of our children are here only briefly,"" Lessing explained as
 they walked along, ""and some have been here for years. We maintain a
 top-ranking curriculum—your idea of a 'country day school' wasn't
 so far afield at that—with scholarships supported by Hoffman Center
 funds. Other children come to us—foundlings, desertees, children from
 broken homes, children of all ages from infancy on. Sometimes they
 stay until they have reached college age, or go on to jobs. As far as
 psionics research is concerned, we are not trying to be teachers. We
 are strictly observers. We try to place the youngsters in positions
 where they can develope what potential they have—
without
the
 presence of external psionic influences they would normally be subject
 to. The results have been remarkable.""


 He led them into a long, narrow room with chairs and ash trays, facing
 a wide grey glass wall. The room fell into darkness, and through the
 grey glass they could see three children, about four years old, playing
 in a large room.


 ""They're perfectly insulated from us,"" said Lessing. ""A variety of
 recording instruments are working. And before you ask, Dr. Melrose,
 they are all empirical instruments, and they would all defy any
 engineer's attempts to determine what makes them go. We don't know what
 makes them go, and we don't care—they go. That's all we need. Like
 that one, for instance—""


 In the corner a flat screen was flickering, emitting a pale green
 fluorescent light. It hung from the wall by two plastic rods which
 penetrated into the children's room. There was no sign of a switch,
 nor a power source. As the children moved about, the screen flickered.
 Below it, a recording-tape clicked along in little spurts and starts of
 activity.


 ""What are they doing?"" Melrose asked after watching the children a few
 moments.


 ""Those three seem to work as a team, somehow. Each one, individually,
 had a fairly constant recordable psi potential of about seventeen on
 the arbitrary scale we find useful here. Any two of them scale in at
 thirty-four to thirty-six. Put the three together and they operate
 somewhere in the neighborhood of six hundred on the same scale.""
 Lessing smiled. ""This is an isolated phenomenon—it doesn't hold for
 any other three children on the Farm. Nor did we make any effort to
 place them together—they drew each other like magnets. One of our
 workers spent two weeks trying to find out why the instruments weren't
 right. It wasn't the instruments, of course.""


 Lessing nodded to an attendant, and peered around at Melrose. ""Now, I
 want you to watch this very closely.""


 He opened a door and walked into the room with the children. The
 fluorescent screen continued to flicker as the children ran to Lessing.
 He inspected the block tower they were building, and stooped down to
 talk to them, his lips moving soundlessly behind the observation wall.
 The children laughed and jabbered, apparently intrigued by the game he
 was proposing. He walked to the table and tapped the bottom block in
 the tower with his thumb.


 The tower quivered, and the screen blazed out with green light, but the
 tower stood. Carefully Lessing jogged all the foundation blocks out of
 place until the tower hung in midair, clearly unsupported. The children
 watched it closely, and the foundation blocks inched still further out
 of place....
Then, quite casually, Lessing lifted off his monitor. The children
 continued staring at the tower as the screen gave three or four violent
 bursts of green fire and went dark.


 The block tower fell with a crash.


 Moments later Lessing was back in the observation room, leaving the
 children busily putting the tower back together. There was a little
 smile on his lips as he saw Melrose's face. ""Perhaps you're beginning
 to see what I'm driving at,"" he said slowly.


 ""Yes,"" said Melrose. ""I think I'm beginning to see."" He scratched his
 jaw. ""You think that it's adult psi-contact that drives the child's
 potential underground—that somehow adult contact acts like a damper, a
 sort of colossal candle-snuffer.""


 ""That's what I think,"" said Lessing.


 ""How do you know those children didn't make you take off your monitor?""


 Lessing blinked. ""Why should they?""


 ""Maybe they enjoy the crash when the blocks fall down.""


 ""But that wouldn't make any difference, would it? The blocks still fall
 down.""


 Melrose paced down the narrow room. ""This is very good,"" he said
 suddenly, his voice earnest. ""You have fine facilities here, good
 workers. And in spite of my flippancy, Dr. Lessing, I have never
 imagined for a moment that you were not an acute observer and a
 careful, highly imaginative worker. But suppose I told you, in perfect
 faith, that we have data that flatly contradicts everything you've told
 me today. Reproducible data, utterly incompatable with yours. What
 would you say to that?""


 ""I'd say you were wrong,"" said Lessing. ""You couldn't have such data.
 According to the things I am certain are true, what you're saying is
 sheer nonsense.""


 ""And you'd express that opinion in a professional meeting?""


 ""I would.""


 ""And as an Authority on psionic behavior patterns,"" said Melrose
 slowly, ""you would kill us then and there. You would strangle us
 professionally, discredit anything we did, cut us off cold."" The
 tall man turned on him fiercely. ""Are you blind, man? Can't you see
 what danger you're in? If you publish your book now, you will become
 an Authority in a field where the most devastating thing that could
 possibly happen would be—
the appearance of an Authority
.""
Lessing and Dorffman rode back to the Hoffman Center in grim silence.
 At first Lessing pretended to work; finally he snapped off the tape
 recorder in disgust and stared out the shuttle-car window. Melrose had
 gone on to Idlewild to catch a jet back to Chicago. It was a relief to
 see him go, Lessing thought, and tried to force the thin, angry man
 firmly out of his mind. But somehow Melrose wouldn't force.


 ""Stop worrying about it,"" Dorffman urged. ""He's a crackpot. He's
 crawled way out on a limb, and now he's afraid your theory is going to
 cut it off under him. Well, that's his worry, not yours."" Dorffman's
 face was intense. ""Scientifically, you're on unshakeable ground. Every
 great researcher has people like Melrose sniping at him. You just have
 to throw them off and keep going.""


 Lessing shook his head. ""Maybe. But this field of work is different
 from any other, Jack. It doesn't follow the rules. Maybe scientific
 grounds aren't right at all, in this case.""


 Dorffman snorted. ""Surely there's nothing wrong with theorizing—""


 ""He wasn't objecting to the theory. He's afraid of what happens after
 the theory.""


 ""So it seems. But why?""


 ""Have you ever considered what makes a man an Authority?""


 ""He knows more about his field than anybody else does.""


 ""He
seems
to, you mean. And therefore, anything he says about it
 carries more weight than what anybody else says. Other workers follow
 his lead. He developes ideas, formulates theories—and then
defends
 them for all he's worth
.""


 ""But why shouldn't he?""


 ""Because a man can't fight for his life and reputation and still keep
 his objectivity,"" said Lessing. ""And what if he just happens to be
 wrong? Once he's an Authority the question of what's right and what's
 wrong gets lost in the shuffle. It's
what he says
that counts.""


 ""But we
know
you're right,"" Dorffman protested.


 ""Do we?""


 ""Of course we do! Look at our work! Look at what we've seen on the
 Farm.""


 ""Yes, I know."" Lessing's voice was weary. ""But first I think we'd
 better look at Tommy Gilman, and the quicker we look, the better—""


 A nurse greeted them as they stepped off the elevator. ""We called
 you at the Farm, but you'd already left. The boy—"" She broke off
 helplessly. ""He's sick, Doctor. He's sicker than we ever imagined.""


 ""What happened?""


 ""Nothing exactly—happened. I don't quite know how to describe it.""
 She hurried them down the corridor and opened a door into a large
 children's playroom. ""See what you think.""


 The boy sat stolidly in the corner of the room. He looked up as they
 came in, but there was no flicker of recognition or pleasure on his
 pale face. The monitor helmet was still on his head. He just sat there,
 gripping a toy fire engine tightly in his hands.


 Lessing crossed the room swiftly. ""Tommy,"" he said.


 The boy didn't even look at him. He stared stupidly at the fire engine.


 ""Tommy!"" Lessing reached out for the toy. The boy drew back in terror,
 clutching it to his chest. ""Go away,"" he choked. ""Go away, go away—""
 When Lessing persisted the boy bent over swiftly and bit him hard on
 the hand.


 Lessing sat down on the table. ""Tommy, listen to me."" His voice was
 gentle. ""I won't try to take it again. I promise.""


 ""Go away.""


 ""Do you know who I am?""


 Tommy's eyes shifted haltingly to Lessing's face. He nodded. ""Go away.""


 ""Why are you afraid, Tommy?""


 ""I hurt. My head hurts. I hurt all over. Go away.""


 ""Why do you hurt?""


 ""I—can't get it—off,"" the boy said.
The monitor
, Lessing thought suddenly. Something had suddenly gone
 horribly wrong—could the boy really be sensing the source of the
 trouble? Lessing felt a cold knot gather in the pit of his stomach. He
 knew what happened when adult psi-contact struck a psi-high youngster's
 mind. He had seen it a hundred times at the Farm. But even more—he
 had felt it in his own mind, bursting from the child. Like a violent
 physical blow, the hate and fear and suspicion and cruelty buried and
 repressed in the adult mind, crushing suddenly into the raw receptors
 of the child's mind like a smothering fog—it was a fearful thing. A
 healthy youngster could survive it, even though the scar remained. But
 this youngster was sick—


 And yet
an animal instinctively seeks its own protection
. With
 trembling fingers Lessing reached out and opened the baffle-snap on the
 monitor. ""Take it off, Tommy,"" he whispered.


 The boy blinked in amazement, and pulled the grey helmet from his head.
 Lessing felt the familiar prickly feeling run down his scalp as the
 boy stared at him. He could feel deep in his own mind the cold chill
 of terror radiating from the boy. Then, suddenly, it began to fade. A
 sense of warmth—peace and security and comfort—swept in as the fear
 faded from the boy's face.


 The fire engine clattered to the floor.
They analyzed the tapes later, punching the data cards with greatest
 care, filing them through the machines for the basic processing and
 classification that all their data underwent. It was late that night
 when they had the report back in their hands.


 Dorffman stared at it angrily. ""It's obviously wrong,"" he grated. ""It
 doesn't fit. Dave, it doesn't agree with
anything
we've observed
 before. There must be an error.""


 ""Of course,"" said Lessing. ""According to the theory. The theory says
 that adult psi-contact is deadly to the growing child. It smothers
 their potential through repeated contact until it dries up completely.
 We've proved that, haven't we? Time after time. Everything goes
 according to the theory—except Tommy. But Tommy's psi-potential was
 drying up there on the Farm, until the distortion was threatening the
 balance of his mind. Then he made an adult contact, and we saw how he
 bloomed."" Lessing sank down to his desk wearily. ""What are we going to
 do, Jack? Formulate a separate theory for Tommy?""


 ""Of course not,"" said Dorffman. ""The instruments were wrong. Somehow we
 misread the data—""


 ""Didn't you see his
face
?"" Lessing burst out. ""Didn't you see how he
acted
? What do you want with an instrument reading?"" He shook his
 head. ""It's no good, Jack. Something different happened here, something
 we'd never counted on. It's something the theory just doesn't allow
 for.""


 They sat silently for a while. Then Dorffman said: ""What are you going
 to do?""


 ""I don't know,"" said Lessing. ""Maybe when we fell into this bramble
 bush we blinded ourselves with the urge to classify—to line everything
 up in neat rows like pins in a paper. Maybe we were so blind we missed
 the path altogether.""


 ""But the book is due! The Conference speech—""


 ""I think we'll make some changes in the book,"" Lessing said slowly.
 ""It'll be costly—but it might even be fun. It's a pretty dry, logical
 presentation of ideas, as it stands. Very austere and authoritarian.
 But a few revisions could change all that—"" He rubbed his hands
 together thoughtfully. ""How about it, Jack? Do we have nerve enough to
 be laughed at? Do you think we could stand a little discredit, making
 silly asses of ourselves? Because when I finish this book, we'll be
 laughed out of existence. There won't be any Authority in psionics for
 a while—and maybe that way one of the lads who's
really
sniffing out
 the trail will get somebody to listen to him!


 ""Get a pad, get a pencil! We've got work to do. And when we finish, I
 think we'll send a carbon copy out Chicago way. Might even persuade
 that puppy out there to come here and work for me—""

 HUNTED

 HEROES
By ROBERT SILVERBERG
The planet itself was tough enough—barren, desolate,
 forbidding; enough to stop the most adventurous and
 dedicated. But they had to run head-on against a mad
 genius who had a motto:
Death to all Terrans!
""Let's
 keep moving,"" I told
 Val. ""The surest way to
 die out here on Mars is to
 give up."" I reached over and
 turned up the pressure on her
 oxymask to make things a
 little easier for her. Through
 the glassite of the mask, I
 could see her face contorted
 in an agony of fatigue.


 And she probably thought
 the failure of the sandcat was
 all my fault, too. Val's usually
 about the best wife a guy
 could ask for, but when she
 wants to be she can be a real
 flying bother.


 It was beyond her to see
 that some grease monkey back
 at the Dome was at fault—whoever
 it was who had failed
 to fasten down the engine
 hood. Nothing but what had
 stopped us
could
stop a sandcat:
 sand in the delicate
 mechanism of the atomic engine.


 But no; she blamed it all on
 me somehow: So we were out
 walking on the spongy sand
 of the Martian desert. We'd
 been walking a good eight
 hours.


 ""Can't we turn back now,
 Ron?"" Val pleaded. ""Maybe
 there isn't any uranium in
 this sector at all. I think
 we're crazy to keep on searching
 out here!""


 I started to tell her that the
 UranCo chief had assured me
 we'd hit something out this
 way, but changed my mind.
 When Val's tired and overwrought
 there's no sense in
 arguing with her.


 I stared ahead at the bleak,
 desolate wastes of the Martian
 landscape. Behind us
 somewhere was the comfort
 of the Dome, ahead nothing
 but the mazes and gullies of
 this dead world.
He was a cripple in a wheelchair—helpless as a rattlesnake.
""Try to keep going, Val.""
 My gloved hand reached out
 and clumsily enfolded hers.
 ""Come on, kid. Remember—we're
 doing this for Earth.
 We're heroes.""


 She glared at me. ""Heroes,
 hell!"" she muttered. ""That's
 the way it looked back home,
 but, out there it doesn't seem
 so glorious. And UranCo's
 pay is stinking.""


 ""We didn't come out here
 for the pay, Val.""


 ""I know, I know, but just
 the same—""


 It must have been hell for
 her. We had wandered fruitlessly
 over the red sands all
 day, both of us listening for
 the clicks of the counter. And
 the geigers had been obstinately
 hushed all day, except
 for their constant undercurrent
 of meaningless noises.


 Even though the Martian
 gravity was only a fraction of
 Earth's, I was starting to
 tire, and I knew it must have
 been really rough on Val with
 her lovely but unrugged legs.


 ""Heroes,"" she said bitterly.
 ""We're not heroes—we're
 suckers! Why did I ever let
 you volunteer for the Geig
 Corps and drag me along?""


 Which wasn't anywhere
 close to the truth. Now I
 knew she was at the breaking
 point, because Val didn't lie
 unless she was so exhausted
 she didn't know what she was
 doing. She had been just as
 much inflamed by the idea of
 coming to Mars to help in the
 search for uranium as I was.
 We knew the pay was poor,
 but we had felt it a sort of
 obligation, something we
 could do as individuals to
 keep the industries of radioactives-starved
 Earth going.
 And we'd always had a roving
 foot, both of us.


 No, we had decided together
 to come to Mars—the
 way we decided together on
 everything. Now she was
 turning against me.
I tried to jolly her. ""Buck
 up, kid,"" I said. I didn't dare
 turn up her oxy pressure any
 higher, but it was obvious she
 couldn't keep going. She was
 almost sleep-walking now.


 We pressed on over the
 barren terrain. The geiger
 kept up a fairly steady click-pattern,
 but never broke into
 that sudden explosive tumult
 that meant we had found pay-dirt.
 I started to feel tired
 myself, terribly tired. I longed
 to lie down on the soft,
 spongy Martian sand and
 bury myself.


 I looked at Val. She was
 dragging along with her eyes
 half-shut. I felt almost guilty
 for having dragged her out to
 Mars, until I recalled that I
 hadn't. In fact, she had come
 up with the idea before I did.
 I wished there was some way
 of turning the weary, bedraggled
 girl at my side back into
 the Val who had so enthusiastically
 suggested we join
 the Geigs.


 Twelve steps later, I decided
 this was about as far as
 we could go.


 I stopped, slipped out of
 the geiger harness, and lowered
 myself ponderously to
 the ground. ""What'samatter,
 Ron?"" Val asked sleepily.
 ""Something wrong?""


 ""No, baby,"" I said, putting
 out a hand and taking hers.
 ""I think we ought to rest a
 little before we go any further.
 It's been a long, hard
 day.""


 It didn't take much to persuade
 her. She slid down beside
 me, curled up, and in a
 moment she was fast asleep,
 sprawled out on the sands.
Poor kid
, I thought. Maybe
 we shouldn't have come to
 Mars after all. But, I reminded
 myself,
someone
had to do
 the job.


 A second thought appeared,
 but I squelched it:


 Why the hell me?


 I looked down at Valerie's
 sleeping form, and thought of
 our warm, comfortable little
 home on Earth. It wasn't
 much, but people in love don't
 need very fancy surroundings.


 I watched her, sleeping
 peacefully, a wayward lock of
 her soft blonde hair trailing
 down over one eyebrow, and
 it seemed hard to believe that
 we'd exchanged Earth and all
 it held for us for the raw, untamed
 struggle that was Mars.
 But I knew I'd do it again, if
 I had the chance. It's because
 we wanted to keep what we
 had. Heroes? Hell, no. We
 just liked our comforts, and
 wanted to keep them. Which
 took a little work.
Time to get moving.
But
 then Val stirred and rolled
 over in her sleep, and I didn't
 have the heart to wake her. I
 sat there, holding her, staring
 out over the desert, watching
 the wind whip the sand up
 into weird shapes.


 The Geig Corps preferred
 married couples, working in
 teams. That's what had finally
 decided it for us—we were a
 good team. We had no ties on
 Earth that couldn't be broken
 without much difficulty. So
 we volunteered.
And here we are.
Heroes.
 The wind blasted a mass of
 sand into my face, and I felt
 it tinkle against the oxymask.


 I glanced at the suit-chronometer.
 Getting late. I decided
 once again to wake Val.
 But she was tired. And I was
 tired too, tired from our
 wearying journey across the
 empty desert.


 I started to shake Val. But
 I never finished. It would be
so
nice just to lean back and
 nuzzle up to her, down in the
 sand. So nice. I yawned, and
 stretched back.
I awoke with a sudden startled
 shiver, and realized angrily
 I had let myself doze off.
 ""Come on, Val,"" I said savagely,
 and started to rise to
 my feet.


 I couldn't.


 I looked down. I was neatly
 bound in thin, tough, plastic
 tangle-cord, swathed from
 chin to boot-bottoms, my
 arms imprisoned, my feet
 caught. And tangle-cord is
 about as easy to get out of as
 a spider's web is for a trapped
 fly.


 It wasn't Martians that
 had done it. There weren't
 any Martians, hadn't been for
 a million years. It was some
 Earthman who had bound us.


 I rolled my eyes toward
 Val, and saw that she was
 similarly trussed in the sticky
 stuff. The tangle-cord was still
 fresh, giving off a faint, repugnant
 odor like that of drying
 fish. It had been spun on
 us only a short time ago, I
 realized.


 ""Ron—""


 ""Don't try to move, baby.
 This stuff can break your
 neck if you twist it wrong.""
 She continued for a moment
 to struggle futilely, and I had
 to snap, ""Lie still, Val!""


 ""A very wise statement,""
 said a brittle, harsh voice
 from above me. I looked up
 and saw a helmeted figure
 above us. He wasn't wearing
 the customary skin-tight pliable
 oxysuits we had. He
 wore an outmoded, bulky
 spacesuit and a fishbowl helmet,
 all but the face area
 opaque. The oxygen cannisters
 weren't attached to his
 back as expected, though.
 They were strapped to the
 back of the wheelchair in
 which he sat.


 Through the fishbowl I
 could see hard little eyes, a
 yellowed, parchment-like face,
 a grim-set jaw. I didn't recognize
 him, and this struck me
 odd. I thought I knew everyone
 on sparsely-settled Mars.
 Somehow I'd missed him.


 What shocked me most was
 that he had no legs. The
 spacesuit ended neatly at the
 thighs.


 He was holding in his left
 hand the tanglegun with
 which he had entrapped us,
 and a very efficient-looking
 blaster was in his right.


 ""I didn't want to disturb
 your sleep,"" he said coldly.
 ""So I've been waiting here
 for you to wake up.""


 I could just see it. He might
 have been sitting there for
 hours, complacently waiting
 to see how we'd wake up.
 That was when I realized he
 must be totally insane. I could
 feel my stomach-muscles
 tighten, my throat constrict
 painfully.


 Then anger ripped through
 me, washing away the terror.
 ""What's going on?"" I demanded,
 staring at the half
 of a man who confronted us
 from the wheelchair. ""Who
 are you?""


 ""You'll find out soon
 enough,"" he said. ""Suppose
 now you come with me."" He
 reached for the tanglegun,
 flipped the little switch on its
 side to MELT, and shot a
 stream of watery fluid over
 our legs, keeping the blaster
 trained on us all the while.
 Our legs were free.


 ""You may get up now,"" he
 said. ""Slowly, without trying
 to make trouble."" Val and I
 helped each other to our feet
 as best we could, considering
 our arms were still tightly
 bound against the sides of our
 oxysuits.


 ""Walk,"" the stranger said,
 waving the tanglegun to indicate
 the direction. ""I'll be
 right behind you."" He holstered
 the tanglegun.


 I glimpsed the bulk of an
 outboard atomic rigging behind
 him, strapped to the
 back of the wheelchair. He
 fingered a knob on the arm of
 the chair and the two exhaust
 ducts behind the wheel-housings
 flamed for a moment,
 and the chair began to roll.


 Obediently, we started
 walking. You don't argue
 with a blaster, even if the
 man pointing it is in a wheelchair.
""What's going on, Ron?""
 Val asked in a low voice as we
 walked. Behind us the wheelchair
 hissed steadily.


 ""I don't quite know, Val.
 I've never seen this guy before,
 and I thought I knew
 everyone at the Dome.""


 ""Quiet up there!"" our captor
 called, and we stopped
 talking. We trudged along together,
 with him following
 behind; I could hear the
crunch-crunch
of the wheelchair
 as its wheels chewed
 into the sand. I wondered
 where we were going, and
 why. I wondered why we had
 ever left Earth.


 The answer to that came to
 me quick enough: we had to.
 Earth needed radioactives,
 and the only way to get them
 was to get out and look. The
 great atomic wars of the late
 20th Century had used up
 much of the supply, but the
 amount used to blow up half
 the great cities of the world
 hardly compared with the
 amount we needed to put
 them back together again.


 In three centuries the shattered
 world had been completely
 rebuilt. The wreckage
 of New York and Shanghai
 and London and all the other
 ruined cities had been hidden
 by a shining new world of
 gleaming towers and flying
 roadways. We had profited by
 our grandparents' mistakes.
 They had used their atomics
 to make bombs. We used ours
 for fuel.


 It was an atomic world.
 Everything: power drills,
 printing presses, typewriters,
 can openers, ocean liners,
 powered by the inexhaustible
 energy of the dividing atom.


 But though the energy is
 inexhaustible, the supply of
 nuclei isn't. After three centuries
 of heavy consumption,
 the supply failed. The mighty
 machine that was Earth's industry
 had started to slow
 down.


 And that started the chain
 of events that led Val and me
 to end up as a madman's prisoners,
 on Mars. With every
 source of uranium mined dry
 on Earth, we had tried other
 possibilities. All sorts of
 schemes came forth. Project
 Sea-Dredge was trying to get
 uranium from the oceans. In
 forty or fifty years, they'd
 get some results, we hoped.
 But there wasn't forty or
 fifty years' worth of raw stuff
 to tide us over until then. In a
 decade or so, our power would
 be just about gone. I could
 picture the sort of dog-eat-dog
 world we'd revert back
 to. Millions of starving, freezing
 humans tooth-and-clawing
 in it in the useless shell of
 a great atomic civilization.


 So, Mars. There's not much
 uranium on Mars, and it's not
 easy to find or any cinch to
 mine. But what little is there,
 helps. It's a stopgap effort,
 just to keep things moving
 until Project Sea-Dredge
 starts functioning.


 Enter the Geig Corps: volunteers
 out on the face of
 Mars, combing for its uranium
 deposits.


 And here we are, I thought.
After we walked on a
 while, a Dome became visible
 up ahead. It slid up over the
 crest of a hill, set back between
 two hummocks on the
 desert. Just out of the way
 enough to escape observation.


 For a puzzled moment I
 thought it was our Dome, the
 settlement where all of UranCo's
 Geig Corps were located,
 but another look told me that
 this was actually quite near
 us and fairly small. A one-man
 Dome, of all things!


 ""Welcome to my home,"" he
 said. ""The name is Gregory
 Ledman."" He herded us off to
 one side of the airlock, uttered
 a few words keyed to his
 voice, and motioned us inside
 when the door slid up. When
 we were inside he reached up,
 clumsily holding the blaster,
 and unscrewed the ancient
 spacesuit fishbowl.


 His face was a bitter,
 dried-up mask. He was a man
 who hated.


 The place was spartanly
 furnished. No chairs, no tape-player,
 no decoration of any
 sort. Hard bulkhead walls,
 rivet-studded, glared back
 at us. He had an automatic
 chef, a bed, and a writing-desk,
 and no other furniture.


 Suddenly he drew the tanglegun
 and sprayed our legs
 again. We toppled heavily to
 the floor. I looked up angrily.
""I imagine you want to
 know the whole story,"" he
 said. ""The others did, too.""


 Valerie looked at me anxiously.
 Her pretty face was a
 dead white behind her oxymask.
 ""What others?""


 ""I never bothered to find
 out their names,"" Ledman
 said casually. ""They were
 other Geigs I caught unawares,
 like you, out on the
 desert. That's the only sport I
 have left—Geig-hunting. Look
 out there.""


 He gestured through the
 translucent skin of the Dome,
 and I felt sick. There was a
 little heap of bones lying
 there, looking oddly bright
 against the redness of the
 sands. They were the dried,
 parched skeletons of Earthmen.
 Bits of cloth and plastic,
 once oxymasks and suits, still
 clung to them.


 Suddenly I remembered.
 There had been a pattern
 there all the time. We didn't
 much talk about it; we chalked
 it off as occupational hazards.
 There had been a pattern
 of disappearances on the desert.
 I could think of six, eight
 names now. None of them
 had been particularly close
 friends. You don't get time to
 make close friends out here.
 But we'd vowed it wouldn't
 happen to us.


 It had.


 ""You've been hunting
 Geigs?"" I asked. ""
Why?
What've they ever done to
 you?""


 He smiled, as calmly as if
 I'd just praised his house-keeping.
 ""Because I hate
 you,"" he said blandly. ""I intend
 to wipe every last one of
 you out, one by one.""


 I stared at him. I'd never
 seen a man like this before; I
 thought all his kind had died
 at the time of the atomic
 wars.


 I heard Val sob, ""He's a
 madman!""


 ""No,"" Ledman said evenly.
 ""I'm quite sane, believe me.
 But I'm determined to drive
 the Geigs—and UranCo—off
 Mars. Eventually I'll scare
 you all away.""


 ""Just pick us off in the desert?""


 ""Exactly,"" replied Ledman.
 ""And I have no fears of an
 armed attack. This place is
 well fortified. I've devoted
 years to building it. And I'm
 back against those hills. They
 couldn't pry me out."" He let
 his pale hand run up into his
 gnarled hair. ""I've devoted
 years to this. Ever since—ever
 since I landed here on
 Mars.""
""What are you going to do
 with us?"" Val finally asked,
 after a long silence.


 He didn't smile this time.
 ""Kill you,"" he told her. ""Not
 your husband. I want him as
 an envoy, to go back and tell
 the others to clear off."" He
 rocked back and forth in his
 wheelchair, toying with the
 gleaming, deadly blaster in
 his hand.


 We stared in horror. It was
 a nightmare—sitting there,
 placidly rocking back and
 forth, a nightmare.


 I found myself fervently
 wishing I was back out there
 on the infinitely safer desert.


 ""Do I shock you?"" he asked.
 ""I shouldn't—not when
 you see my motives.""


 ""We don't see them,"" I
 snapped.


 ""Well, let me show you.
 You're on Mars hunting uranium,
 right? To mine and
 ship the radioactives back to
 Earth to keep the atomic engines
 going. Right?""


 I nodded over at our geiger
 counters.


 ""We volunteered to come to
 Mars,"" Val said irrelevantly.


 ""Ah—two young heroes,""
 Ledman said acidly. ""How
 sad. I could almost feel sorry
 for you. Almost.""


 ""Just what is it you're
 after?"" I said, stalling, stalling.


 ""Atomics cost me my legs,""
 he said. ""You remember the
 Sadlerville Blast?"" he asked.


 ""Of course."" And I did, too.
 I'd never forget it. No one
 would. How could I forget
 that great accident—killing
 hundreds, injuring thousands
 more, sterilizing forty miles
 of Mississippi land—when
 the Sadlerville pile went up?


 ""I was there on business at
 the time,"" Ledman said. ""I
 represented Ledman Atomics.
 I was there to sign a new
 contract for my company.
 You know who I am, now?""


 I nodded.


 ""I was fairly well shielded
 when it happened. I never got
 the contract, but I got a good
 dose of radiation instead. Not
 enough to kill me,"" he said.
 ""Just enough to necessitate
 the removal of—"" he indicated
 the empty space at his
 thighs. ""So I got off lightly.""
 He gestured at the wheelchair
 blanket.


 I still didn't understand.
 ""But why kill us Geigs?
We
had nothing to do with it.""


 ""You're just in this by accident,""
 he said. ""You see, after
 the explosion and the amputation,
 my fellow-members on
 the board of Ledman Atomics
 decided that a semi-basket
 case like myself was a poor
 risk as Head of the Board,
 and they took my company
 away. All quite legal, I assure
 you. They left me almost a
 pauper!"" Then he snapped
 the punchline at me.


 ""They renamed Ledman
 Atomics. Who did you say you
 worked for?""


 I began, ""Uran—""


 ""Don't bother. A more inventive
 title than Ledman
 Atomics, but not quite as
 much heart, wouldn't you
 say?"" He grinned. ""I saved
 for years; then I came to
 Mars, lost myself, built this
 Dome, and swore to get even.
 There's not a great deal of
 uranium on this planet, but
 enough to keep me in a style
 to which, unfortunately, I'm
 no longer accustomed.""
He consulted his wrist
 watch. ""Time for my injection.""
 He pulled out the tanglegun
 and sprayed us again,
 just to make doubly certain.
 ""That's another little souvenir
 of Sadlerville. I'm short
 on red blood corpuscles.""


 He rolled over to a wall
 table and fumbled in a container
 among a pile of hypodermics.
 ""There are other injections,
 too. Adrenalin, insulin.
 Others. The Blast turned
 me into a walking pin-cushion.
 But I'll pay it all
 back,"" he said. He plunged
 the needle into his arm.


 My eyes widened. It was
 too nightmarish to be real. I
 wasn't seriously worried
 about his threat to wipe out
 the entire Geig Corps, since
 it was unlikely that one man
 in a wheelchair could pick us
 all off. No, it wasn't the
 threat that disturbed me, so
 much as the whole concept, so
 strange to me, that the human
 mind could be as warped
 and twisted as Ledman's.


 I saw the horror on Val's
 face, and I knew she felt the
 same way I did.


 ""Do you really think you
 can succeed?"" I taunted him.
 ""Really think you can kill
 every Earthman on Mars? Of
 all the insane, cockeyed—""


 Val's quick, worried head-shake
 cut me off. But Ledman
 had felt my words, all right.


 ""Yes! I'll get even with
 every one of you for taking
 away my legs! If we hadn't
 meddled with the atom in the
 first place, I'd be as tall and
 powerful as you, today—instead
 of a useless cripple in a
 wheelchair.""


 ""You're sick, Gregory Ledman,""
 Val said quietly.
 ""You've conceived an impossible
 scheme of revenge and
 now you're taking it out on
 innocent people who've done
 nothing, nothing at all to you.
 That's not sane!""


 His eyes blazed. ""Who are
 you to talk of sanity?""
Uneasily I caught Val's
 glance from a corner of my
 eye. Sweat was rolling down
 her smooth forehead faster
 than the auto-wiper could
 swab it away.


 ""Why don't you do something?
 What are you waiting
 for, Ron?""


 ""Easy, baby,"" I said. I
 knew what our ace in the hole
 was. But I had to get Ledman
 within reach of me first.


 ""Enough,"" he said. ""I'm going
 to turn you loose outside,
 right after—""


 ""
Get sick!
"" I hissed to Val,
 low. She began immediately
 to cough violently, emitting
 harsh, choking sobs. ""Can't
 breathe!"" She began to yell,
 writhing in her bonds.


 That did it. Ledman hadn't
 much humanity left in him,
 but there was a little. He lowered
 the blaster a bit and
 wheeled one-hand over to see
 what was wrong with Val.
 She continued to retch and
 moan most horribly. It almost
 convinced me. I saw Val's
 pale, frightened face turn to
 me.


 He approached and peered
 down at her. He opened his
 mouth to say something, and
 at that moment I snapped my
 leg up hard, tearing the tangle-cord
 with a snicking rasp,
 and kicked his wheelchair
 over.


 The blaster went off, burning
 a hole through the Dome
 roof. The automatic sealers
 glued-in instantly. Ledman
 went sprawling helplessly out
 into the middle of the floor,
 the wheelchair upended next
 to him, its wheels slowly revolving
 in the air. The blaster
 flew from his hands at the
 impact of landing and spun
 out near me. In one quick motion
 I rolled over and covered
 it with my body.
Ledman clawed his way to
 me with tremendous effort
 and tried wildly to pry the
 blaster out from under me,
 but without success. I twisted
 a bit, reached out with my
 free leg, and booted him
 across the floor. He fetched
 up against the wall of the
 Dome and lay there.


 Val rolled over to me.


 ""Now if I could get free of
 this stuff,"" I said, ""I could get
 him covered before he comes
 to. But how?""


 ""Teamwork,"" Val said. She
 swivelled around on the floor
 until her head was near my
 boot. ""Push my oxymask off
 with your foot, if you can.""


 I searched for the clamp
 and tried to flip it. No luck,
 with my heavy, clumsy boot.
 I tried again, and this time it
 snapped open. I got the tip
 of my boot in and pried upward.
 The oxymask came off,
 slowly, scraping a jagged red
 scratch up the side of Val's
 neck as it came.


 ""There,"" she breathed.
 ""That's that.""


 I looked uneasily at Ledman.
 He was groaning and
 beginning to stir.


 Val rolled on the floor and
 her face lay near my right
 arm. I saw what she had in
 mind. She began to nibble the
 vile-tasting tangle-cord, running
 her teeth up and down
 it until it started to give. She
 continued unfailingly.


 Finally one strand snapped.
 Then another. At last I
 had enough use of my hand
 to reach out and grasp the
 blaster. Then I pulled myself
 across the floor to Ledman,
 removed the tanglegun, and
 melted the remaining tangle-cord
 off.


 My muscles were stiff and
 bunched, and rising made me
 wince. I turned and freed Val.
 Then I turned and faced Ledman.


 ""I suppose you'll kill me
 now,"" he said.


 ""No. That's the difference
 between sane people and insane,""
 I told him. ""I'm not
 going to kill you at all. I'm
 going to see to it that you're
 sent back to Earth.""


 ""
No!
"" he shouted. ""No!
 Anything but back there. I
 don't want to face them again—not
 after what they did to
 me—""


 ""Not so loud,"" I broke in.
 ""They'll help you on Earth.
 They'll take all the hatred and
 sickness out of you, and turn
 you into a useful member of
 society again.""


 ""I hate Earthmen,"" he spat
 out. ""I hate all of them.""


 ""I know,"" I said sarcastically.
 ""You're just all full of
 hate. You hated us so much
 that you couldn't bear to hang
 around on Earth for as much
 as a year after the Sadlerville
 Blast. You had to take right
 off for Mars without a moment's
 delay, didn't you? You
 hated Earth so much you
had
to leave.""


 ""Why are you telling all
 this to me?""


 ""Because if you'd stayed
 long enough, you'd have used
 some of your pension money
 to buy yourself a pair of prosthetic
 legs, and then you
 wouldn't need this wheelchair.""


 Ledman scowled, and then
 his face went belligerent
 again. ""They told me I was
 paralyzed below the waist.
 That I'd never walk again,
 even with prosthetic legs, because
 I had no muscles to fit
 them to.""


 ""You left Earth too quickly,""
 Val said.


 ""It was the only way,"" he
 protested. ""I had to get off—""


 ""She's right,"" I told him.
 ""The atom can take away, but
 it can give as well. Soon after
 you left they developed
atomic-powered
prosthetics—amazing
 things, virtually robot
 legs. All the survivors of
 the Sadlerville Blast were
 given the necessary replacement
 limbs free of charge. All
 except you. You were so sick
 you had to get away from the
 world you despised and come
 here.""


 ""You're lying,"" he said.
 ""It's not true!""


 ""Oh, but it is,"" Val smiled.


 I saw him wilt visibly, and
 for a moment I almost felt
 sorry for him, a pathetic legless
 figure propped up against
 the wall of the Dome at
 blaster-point. But then I remembered
 he'd killed twelve
 Geigs—or more—and would
 have added Val to the number
 had he had the chance.
""You're a very sick man,
 Ledman,"" I said. ""All this
 time you could have been
 happy, useful on Earth, instead
 of being holed up here
 nursing your hatred. You
 might have been useful, on
 Earth. But you decided to
 channel everything out as revenge.""


 ""I still don't believe it—those
 legs. I might have walked
 again. No—no, it's all a lie.
 They told me I'd never walk,""
 he said, weakly but stubbornly
 still.


 I could see his whole structure
 of hate starting to topple,
 and I decided to give it
 the final push.


 ""Haven't you wondered
 how I managed to break the
 tangle-cord when I kicked you
 over?""


 ""Yes—human legs aren't
 strong enough to break tangle-cord
 that way.""


 ""Of course not,"" I said. I
 gave Val the blaster and slipped
 out of my oxysuit.
 ""Look,"" I said. I pointed to
 my smooth, gleaming metal
 legs. The almost soundless
 purr of their motors was the
 only noise in the room. ""I was
 in the Sadlerville Blast, too,""
 I said. ""But I didn't go crazy
 with hate when I lost
my
legs.""


 Ledman was sobbing.


 ""Okay, Ledman,"" I said.
 Val got him into his suit, and
 brought him the fishbowl helmet.
 ""Get your helmet on and
 let's go. Between the psychs
 and the prosthetics men,
 you'll be a new man inside of
 a year.""


 ""But I'm a murderer!""


 ""That's right. And you'll be
 sentenced to psych adjustment.
 When they're finished,
 Gregory Ledman the killer
 will be as dead as if they'd
 electrocuted you, but there'll
 be a new—and sane—Gregory
 Ledman."" I turned to Val.


 ""Got the geigers, honey?""


 For the first time since
 Ledman had caught us, I remembered
 how tired Val had
 been out on the desert. I realized
 now that I had been driving
 her mercilessly—me, with
 my chromium legs and atomic-powered
 muscles. No wonder
 she was ready to fold!
 And I'd been too dense to see
 how unfair I had been.


 She lifted the geiger harnesses,
 and I put Ledman
 back in his wheelchair.


 Val slipped her oxymask
 back on and fastened it shut.


 ""Let's get back to the Dome
 in a hurry,"" I said. ""We'll
 turn Ledman over to the authorities.
 Then we can catch
 the next ship for Earth.""


 ""Go back?
Go back?
If you
 think I'm backing down now
 and quitting you can find
 yourself another wife! After
 we dump this guy I'm sacking
 in for twenty hours, and then
 we're going back out there to
 finish that search-pattern.
 Earth needs uranium, honey,
 and I know you'd never be
 happy quitting in the middle
 like that."" She smiled. ""I
 can't wait to get out there
 and start listening for those
 tell-tale clicks.""


 I gave a joyful whoop and
 swung her around. When I
 put her down, she squeezed
 my hand, hard.


 ""Let's get moving, fellow

99917,99917_0L3HWNB7,23,1018,misc-longshort,What cities in the post-Brexit era could learn from a 14th-century trading bloc,2016,Christopher Beanland,Magazine article,"What cities in the post-Brexit era could learn from a 14th-century trading bloc
As you fly from the country now known as Germany to Britain, the coastal geography of northern European cities gently unfurls. You can see where the sea smacks into them, or where yawning estuaries unfold like funnels between green and brown city and choppy blue water. You can track the snaking rivers and canals that form unrepentant umbilical connections to the settlements set a little further inland.  

 By their nature cities along coasts and rivers developed so they could be open to trade with each other. From the middle of the 13th century, and for some 300 years after, many settlements dotted along this route formed the prosperous Hanseatic League, a European trading confederation of market towns, before the rise of the nation state led to its dissolution. 

 The Hanseatic League is not well known, and today it lives on most prominently in the name of the German national airline Lufthansa, literally the 'Hansa of the skies', whose planes you can look out of – and down towards the Hanseatic cities – on the short journeys between mainland Europe and Britain. The letters HH on the number plates of cars in Hamburg stand for Hansestadt Hamburg: another proud little memory of this hidden history. 

 In the traumatised atmosphere of post-Brexit Britain, it is worth remembering the Hanseatic League. It could point us towards new relationships between progressive city dwellers in a world that otherwise seems to be putting the brakes on modernity. 

 Despite some of Britain's Leave voters longing to inhabit a fantastical realm immune to foreign influence, the reality is patently very different to that. In the late 1300s, Chaucer wrote about characters travelling to Jerusalem, and others who came from Europe; and it was at exactly this point that the Hanseatic League slowly started to coalesce, eventually influencing our isles. 

 The League is most easily understood as a loose federation of cities that acted together in self-interest to promote trade. The Hanseatic cities developed their own legal system, and their armies came to one another's aid. Merchants who wanted to buy and sell and travel were taking the lead at a time when nation states were not fit for purpose: in the case of England or Denmark, leadership was too centralised and authoritarian, while in German-speaking lands a nation had yet to be formed.  

 We think of nations today as elemental almost, immovable. Yet look at any city of Mitteleuropa and you'll see the many different names it has had as borders and regimes have shifted with the sands of time. Nations come and go. Cities endure.  

 ""It is often said that great cities survived great empires,"" says Cristina Ampatzidou, editor-in-chief of the Rotterdam-based online publishing platform Amateur Cities. ""So it is not unrealistic to think of cities as discrete entities that compete and collaborate with each other, independently from the states to which they belong."" 

 The cities involved in the Hanseatic League are found along the Baltic and North Sea coasts, and slightly inland too. The League stretched from Novgorod in the east – in what is now Russia – to London in the west. Tallinn, Riga, Gdańsk, Visby, Berlin, Cologne, Antwerp, Stockholm, Bergen, Kiel, Rostock, Dinant, Bruges, Turku, Groningen, Hanover, Wroclaw, Kaliningrad: all were involved at different stages in the Hanse's history, which ran on into the 1500s.  

 The League covered lands that today find themselves a part of the modern nations of Finland, Sweden, Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Norway, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. It was a huge – and hugely ambitious – undertaking in the days when communications consisted of ink and paper and the only viable method of travel was by ship. Wood, fur, wool, silver, herring, cod and salt were the main items traded. But what was also exchanged was knowledge. In some ways it was an exercise in what we today call 'soft diplomacy'. There was no maniacal ruler overseeing things – merchants met and talked. They raised armies and waged war against kings who threatened their businesses and their freedoms and their peace.
There was a kind of proto-democracy at work. Professor Rainer Postel, of the Bundeswehr Universität (Germany's equivalent of Sandhurst military academy), has described the Hanse as ""a community of interests without power politics"". As David Abulafia, Professor of Mediterranean History at Cambridge points out, ""The lack of an elaborate superstructure was one of the things that made the Hanse work. Having said that, one should recognise that Lübeck in particular dominated the League for long periods.""  

 Lübeck was where the merchants most often met; and where renewed recent interest in the Hanse eventually led to Angela Merkel cutting the ribbon at the brand new European Hansemuseum in the city last year.
Germany today – multicultural, economically and culturally motoring, free and fair – seems like the ideal model for a modern European nation state. And part of that success lies in the gravitas the country has given to its Hanseatic history. For Germany is not a top-down country with one city unhealthily dominating as with France and Britain (regional economic inequalities have plagued Britain since the painful de-industrialisation of the 1980s, especially in the north). Germany respects federalism and its cities exist on a much more even keel. The way that Cologne, Munich, Frankfurt, Dusseldorf and Stuttgart all bring varied economic and cultural character to the party is pure Hanse. The former Hanseatic cities of Hamburg, Berlin and Bremen have city state status within Germany, putting them on the same level as a whole region or 'land' like Bavaria or Brandenburg. 

 So how about a new Hanseatic League? I ask Benjamin Barber, senior fellow at New York's Fordham University. ""I believe you will find there is a new Hanse,"" he says, ""that constituted itself about 10 or 11 years ago – including many of the original Hanseatic League cities."" Barber is founder of the Global Parliament of Mayors, which he describes as a kind of Hanse of all cities, not just European ports, which will give cities a global urban voice and a common platform for action. The parliament convenes for its inaugural session in The Hague in September. 

 ""Cities both exist within nations and transcend nations. Their power lies not just in the extent of
de jure
autonomy ceded or granted by 'higher' levels of government,"" says Bruce Katz, centennial scholar at the Washington DC thinktank the Brookings Institution. ""Rather, cities have de facto power, the result of larger market and demographic forces and environmental imperatives that value proximity, density, connectivity and quality. Smart nations will see themselves as partners to their cities, setting strong platforms for urban prosperity and devolving powers, where appropriate, to give cities the flexibility to perform… Dumb nations will continue to dictate from above, stifling market activity and urban potential."" 

 But could we go further? Could cities like London declare independence from the UK? London's economy is larger than that of Scotland and Wales combined. ""States will not vanish or surrender their waning sovereignty,"" says Benjamin Barber. ""But cities will meet across frontiers and work together to solve problems. The objective is not an independent London or New York, but interdependent cities collaborating globally. And that is happening."" 

 London's voters largely wanted to remain a part of the EU and to maintain the city's status as an entrepôt. There is clearly a widening chasm between urban and rural life at the heart of many nations. Visualisations of Austria's recent presidential election showed the issue clearly: the country's cities voted for the Green candidate Alexander Van der Bellen, while the the rural districts went for right-wing nationalist Norbert Hofer (whose legal challenge to the close result has resulted in a rerun being announced for October). And in the USA in November, it's likely that Trump voters will also come from rural areas and Clinton voters from the cities. City dwellers are finding ever more in common with the world's other city dwellers than with their countrymen 50 miles down the road. 

 Back in Britain, one of history's little oddities pops up on the east coast. Boston in Lincolnshire and King's Lynn in Norfolk were both forward-looking Hanseatic League towns that traded with far-flung ports and hosted foreign merchants. King's Lynn contains the only extantHanse House left in Britain (London's was knocked down to build Cannon Street Station in the 1800s). Yet in the EU referendum these two areas polled among the highest Leave votes of anywhere in the country. 

 ""Things change,"" says LSE's Professor Tony Travers. ""[King's Lynn] used to be very highly connected, but the economy moved on and left those trading ports like it in a different situation."" Take, for example, the pivot towards the New World, with which trade made more sense from the west-coast ports like Bristol and Liverpool. While these boomed between the 1600s and 1800s, the Hanseatic ports declined and then died out. ""One of the things that's interesting about the [referendum] decision is that it begs all sorts of questions about the future of the UK and its relationship with Europe; and of London and Scotland and their relationship with the rest of Europe. When the EU began as the EEC in the mid-20th century some saw it as a modern day Hanse. Now the EU seems to be waning, perhaps its successor will have to ape the Hanse even more."" 

 For all its complex beauty, life can ultimately be reduced to a series of binary options: yes or no, stick or twist, in or out, innovation or stagnation, modernity or mythology. The referendum result was disappointing for many progressive observers because it felt like a step backwards. Despite being primarily about trade monopolies and money making, the Hanse was, in its way, an early stab at stepping forwards: it encompassed internationalism, rational thought, free trade, loose democratic institutions and, most crucially of all, movement. 

 The future, for many observers, can only be understood in terms of the free movement of people, capital, goods and ideas. It is this necessary movement, and its possible curtailment, that could be the spark that leads to cities like London to seek independence and parity with other world cities – rather than with the rural hinterlands of Britain. 

 Of course, cities seceding from their nation states would provide huge headaches for countries whose biggest economic driver had been removed – as well as likely deepening ideological differences between city and rural dwellers. Moreover, cities need the food the countryside provides.  

 Yet for all the potential pitfalls, city states can thrive. Look at Singapore, Hong Kong, or de facto city states like Dubai and Abu Dhabi. One of the most telling characteristics about these four – all of course former British imperial enclaves – is that they are utterly outward looking. To return to the sky analogy, it's the airlines of each of these (Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Emirates and Etihad) that open up each respective city to the world in the way that the machinery of the Hanse did on the Baltic Sea 600 years ago. And it's the unions each city makes with other places that also look thoroughly Hanseatic in character. A model for modern city states, then. But is it one that we want? 

 ""The Hanseatic League was not always accepted by local citizens,"" says Cristina Ampatzidou, ""because the privileges granted to the Hanse merchants were forcing local traders out of competition and many cities took steps to eliminate them. The reasons the countryside is turning to the right [globally] are not independent from cities turning increasingly into speculation machines for the profit of a happy few. It is basically these systemic contradictions that must be addressed before we resort to more isolationist ideas that would intensify the urban-rural political divide. The bottom line is not whether a contemporary Hanse-esque federation is possible, it probably is; but whether it is actually desirable.""

Not to be or not to not be ... that was the
 
not-question for the invader of the not-world.
Dear Editor:


 My 14 year old boy, Ronnie, is typing this letter for me because he
 can do it neater and use better grammar. I had to get in touch with
 somebody about this because if there is something to it, then somebody,
 everybody, is going to point finger at me, Ivan Smernda, and say, ""Why
 didn't you warn us?""


 I could not go to the police because they are not too friendly to
 me because of some of my guests who frankly are stew bums. Also they
 might think I was on booze, too, or maybe the hops, and get my license
 revoked. I run a strictly legit hotel even though some of my guests
 might be down on their luck now and then.


 What really got me mixed up in this was the mysterious disappearance of
 two of my guests. They both took a powder last Wednesday morning.


 Now get this. In one room, that of Joe Binkle, which maybe is an alias,
 I find nothing but a suit of clothes, some butts and the letters I
 include here in same package. Binkle had only one suit. That I know.
 And this was it laying right in the middle of the room. Inside the
 coat was the vest, inside the vest the shirt, inside the shirt the
 underwear. The pants were up in the coat and inside of them was also
 the underwear. All this was buttoned up like Binkle had melted out of
 it and dripped through a crack in the floor. In a bureau drawer were
 the letters I told you about.


 Now. In the room right under Binkle's lived another stew bum that
 checked in Thursday ... name Ed Smith, alias maybe, too. This guy was a
 real case. He brought with him a big mirror with a heavy bronze frame.
 Airloom, he says. He pays a week in advance, staggers up the stairs to
 his room with the mirror and that's the last I see of him.


 In Smith's room on Wednesday I find only a suit of clothes, the same
 suit he wore when he came in. In the coat the vest, in the vest the
 shirt, in the shirt the underwear. Also in the pants. Also all in the
 middle of the floor. Against the far wall stands the frame of the
 mirror. Only the frame!


 What a spot to be in! Now it might have been a gag. Sometimes these
 guys get funny ideas when they are on the stuff. But then I read
 the letters. This knocks me for a loop. They are all in different
 handwritings. All from different places. Stamps all legit, my kid says.
 India, China, England, everywhere.


 My kid, he reads. He says it's no joke. He wants to call the cops or
 maybe some doctor. But I say no. He reads your magazine so he says
 write to you, send you the letters. You know what to do. Now you have
 them. Maybe you print. Whatever you do, Mr. Editor, remember my place,
 the Plaza Ritz Arms, is straight establishment. I don't drink. I never
 touch junk, not even aspirin.
Yours very truly,

 Ivan Smernda

 Dear Joe:


 Greetings, greetings, greetings. Hold firm in your wretched projection,
 for tomorrow you will not be alone in the not-world. In two days I,
 Glmpauszn, will be born.


 Today I hang in our newly developed not-pod just within the mirror
 gateway, torn with the agony that we calculated must go with such
 tremendous wavelength fluctuations. I have attuned myself to a fetus
 within the body of a not-woman in the not-world. Already I am static
 and for hours have looked into this weird extension of the Universe
 with fear and trepidation.


 As soon as my stasis was achieved, I tried to contact you, but got
 no response. What could have diminished your powers of articulate
 wave interaction to make you incapable of receiving my messages and
 returning them? My wave went out to yours and found it, barely pulsing
 and surrounded with an impregnable chimera.


 Quickly, from the not-world vibrations about you, I learned the
 not-knowledge of your location. So I must communicate with you by what
 the not-world calls ""mail"" till we meet. For this purpose I must
 utilize the feeble vibrations of various not-people through whose
 inadequate articulation I will attempt to make my moves known to you.
 Each time I will pick a city other than the one I am in at the time.


 I, Glmpauszn, come equipped with powers evolved from your fragmentary
 reports before you ceased to vibrate to us and with a vast treasury
 of facts from indirect sources. Soon our tortured people will be free
 of the fearsome not-folk and I will be their liberator. You failed in
 your task, but I will try to get you off with light punishment when we
 return again.


 The hand that writes this letter is that of a boy in the not-city of
 Bombay in the not-country of India. He does not know he writes it.
 Tomorrow it will be someone else. You must never know of my exact
 location, for the not-people might have access to the information.


 I must leave off now because the not-child is about to be born. When it
 is alone in the room, it will be spirited away and I will spring from
 the pod on the gateway into its crib and will be its exact vibrational
 likeness.


 I have tremendous powers. But the not-people must never know I am among
 them. This is the only way I could arrive in the room where the gateway
 lies without arousing suspicion. I will grow up as the not-child in
 order that I might destroy the not-people completely.


 All is well, only they shot this information file into my matrix too
 fast. I'm having a hard time sorting facts and make the right decision.
 Gezsltrysk, what a task!


 Farewell till later.

 Dear Joe:


 Mnghjkl, fhfjgfhjklop phelnoprausynks. No. When I communicate with you,
 I see I must avoid those complexities of procedure for which there are
 no terms in this language. There is no way of describing to you in
 not-language what I had to go through during the first moments of my
 birth.


 Now I know what difficulties you must have had with your limited
 equipment. These not-people are unpredictable and strange. Their doctor
 came in and weighed me again the day after my birth. Consternation
 reigned when it was discovered I was ten pounds heavier. What
 difference could it possibly make? Many doctors then came in to see me.
 As they arrived hourly, they found me heavier and heavier. Naturally,
 since I am growing. This is part of my instructions. My not-mother
 (Gezsltrysk!) then burst into tears. The doctors conferred, threw up
 their hands and left.


 I learned the following day that the opposite component of my
 not-mother, my not-father, had been away riding on some conveyance
 during my birth. He was out on ... what did they call it? Oh, yes, a
 bender. He did not arrive till three days after I was born.


 When I heard them say that he was straightening up to come see me, I
 made a special effort and grew marvelously in one afternoon. I was 36
 not-world inches tall by evening. My not-father entered while I was
 standing by the crib examining a syringe the doctor had left behind.
 He stopped in his tracks on entering the room and seemed incapable of
 speech.


 Dredging into the treasury of knowledge I had come equipped with, I
 produced the proper phrase for occasions of this kind in the not-world.


 ""Poppa,"" I said.


 This was the first use I had made of the so-called vocal cords that
 are now part of my extended matrix. The sound I emitted sounded
 low-pitched, guttural and penetrating even to myself. It must have
 jarred on my not-father's ears, for he turned and ran shouting from the
 room.


 They apprehended him on the stairs and I heard him babble something
 about my being a monster and no child of his. My not-mother appeared at
 the doorway and instead of being pleased at the progress of my growth,
 she fell down heavily. She made a distinct
thump
on the floor.


 This brought the rest of them on the run, so I climbed out the window
 and retreated across a nearby field. A prolonged search was launched,
 but I eluded them. What unpredictable beings!


 I reported my tremendous progress back to our world, including the
 cleverness by which I managed to escape my pursuers. I received a reply
 from Blgftury which, on careful analysis, seems to be small praise
 indeed. In fact, some of his phrases apparently contain veiled threats.
 But you know old Blgftury. He wanted to go on this expedition himself
 and it's his nature never to flatter anyone.


 From now on I will refer to not-people simply as people, dropping the
 qualifying preface except where comparisons must be made between this
 alleged world and our own. It is merely an offshoot of our primitive
 mythology when this was considered a spirit world, just as these people
 refer to our world as never-never land and other anomalies. But we
 learned otherwise, while they never have.


 New sensations crowd into my consciousness and I am having a hard
 time classifying them. Anyway, I shall carry on swiftly now to the
 inevitable climax in which I singlehanded will obliterate the terror of
 the not-world and return to our world a hero. I cannot understand your
 not replying to my letters. I have given you a box number. What could
 have happened to your vibrations?
Glmpauszn

 Dear Joe:


 I had tremendous difficulty getting a letter off to you this time.
 My process—original with myself, by the way—is to send out feeler
 vibrations for what these people call the psychic individual. Then I
 establish contact with him while he sleeps and compel him without his
 knowledge to translate my ideas into written language. He writes my
 letter and mails it to you. Of course, he has no awareness of what he
 has done.


 My first five tries were unfortunate. Each time I took control of an
 individual who could not read or write! Finally I found my man, but
 I fear his words are limited. Ah, well. I had great things to tell
 you about my progress, but I cannot convey even a hint of how I have
 accomplished these miracles through the thick skull of this incompetent.


 In simple terms then: I crept into a cave and slipped into a kind of
 sleep, directing my squhjkl ulytz &amp; uhrytzg ... no, it won't come out.
 Anyway, I grew overnight to the size of an average person here.


 As I said before, floods of impressions are driving into my xzbyl ...
 my brain ... from various nerve and sense areas and I am having a hard
 time classifying them. My one idea was to get to a chemist and acquire
 the stuff needed for the destruction of these people.


 Sunrise came as I expected. According to my catalog of information, the
 impressions aroused by it are of beauty. It took little conditioning
 for me finally to react in this manner. This is truly an efficient
 mechanism I inhabit.


 I gazed about me at the mixture of lights, forms and impressions.
 It was strange and ... now I know ... beautiful. However, I hurried
 immediately toward the nearest chemist. At the same time I looked up
 and all about me at the beauty.


 Soon an individual approached. I knew what to do from my information. I
 simply acted natural. You know, one of your earliest instructions was
 to realize that these people see nothing unusual in you if you do not
 let yourself believe they do.


 This individual I classified as a female of a singular variety here.
 Her hair was short, her upper torso clad in a woolen garment. She
 wore ... what are they? ... oh, yes, sneakers. My attention was
 diverted by a scream as I passed her. I stopped.


 The woman gesticulated and continued to scream. People hurried from
 nearby houses. I linked my hands behind me and watched the scene with
 an attitude of mild interest. They weren't interested in me, I told
 myself. But they were.


 I became alarmed, dived into a bush and used a mechanism that you
 unfortunately do not have—invisibility. I lay there and listened.


 ""He was stark naked,"" the girl with the sneakers said.


 A figure I recognized as a police officer spoke to her.


 ""Lizzy, you'll just have to keep these crackpot friends of yours out of
 this area.""


 ""But—""


 ""No more buck-bathing, Lizzy,"" the officer ordered. ""No more speeches
 in the Square. Not when it results in riots at five in the morning. Now
 where is your naked friend? I'm going to make an example of him.""


 That was it—I had forgotten clothes. There is only one answer to this
 oversight on my part. My mind is confused by the barrage of impressions
 that assault it. I must retire now and get them all classified. Beauty,
 pain, fear, hate, love, laughter. I don't know one from the other. I
 must feel each, become accustomed to it.


 The more I think about it, the more I realize that the information I
 have been given is very unrealistic. You have been inefficient, Joe.
 What will Blgftury and the others say of this? My great mission is
 impaired. Farewell, till I find a more intelligent mind so I can write
 you with more enlightenment.

 Dear Joe:


 I received your first communication today. It baffles me. Do you greet
 me in the proper fringe-zone manner? No. Do you express joy, hope,
 pride, helpfulness at my arrival? No. You ask me for a loan of five
 bucks!


 It took me some time, culling my information catalog to come up with
 the correct variant of the slang term ""buck."" Is it possible that you
 are powerless even to provide yourself with the wherewithal to live in
 this inferior world?


 A reminder, please. You and I—I in particular—are now engaged in
 a struggle to free our world from the terrible, maiming intrusions
 of this not-world. Through many long gleebs, our people have lived
 a semi-terrorized existence while errant vibrations from this world
 ripped across the closely joined vibration flux, whose individual
 fluctuations make up our sentient population.


 Even our eminent, all-high Frequency himself has often been jeopardized
 by these people. The not-world and our world are like two baskets
 as you and I see them in our present forms. Baskets woven with the
 greatest intricacy, design and color; but baskets whose convex sides
 are joined by a thin fringe of filaments. Our world, on the vibrational
 plane, extends just a bit into this, the not-world. But being a world
 of higher vibration, it is ultimately tenuous to these gross peoples.
 While we vibrate only within a restricted plane because of our purer,
 more stable existence, these people radiate widely into our world.


 They even send what they call psychic reproductions of their own selves
 into ours. And most infamous of all, they sometimes are able to force
 some of our individuals over the fringe into their world temporarily,
 causing them much agony and fright.


 The latter atrocity is perpetrated through what these people call
 mediums, spiritualists and other fatuous names. I intend to visit one
 of them at the first opportunity to see for myself.


 Meanwhile, as to you, I would offer a few words of advice. I picked
 them up while examining the ""slang"" portion of my information catalog
 which you unfortunately caused me to use. So, for the ultimate
 cause—in this, the penultimate adventure, and for the glory and peace
 of our world—shake a leg, bub. Straighten up and fly right. In short,
 get hep.


 As far as the five bucks is concerned, no dice.

 Dear Joe:


 Your letter was imponderable till I had thrashed through long passages
 in my information catalog that I had never imagined I would need.
 Biological functions and bodily processes which are labeled here
 ""revolting"" are used freely in your missive. You can be sure they are
 all being forwarded to Blgftury. If I were not involved in the most
 important part of my journey—completion of the weapon against the
 not-worlders—I would come to New York immediately. You would rue that
 day, I assure you.

 Dear Joe:


 A great deal has happened to me since I wrote to you last.
 Systematically, I have tested each emotion and sensation listed in
 our catalog. I have been, as has been said in this world, like a reed
 bending before the winds of passion. In fact, I'm rather badly bent
 indeed. Ah! You'll pardon me, but I just took time for what is known
 quaintly in this tongue as a ""hooker of red-eye."" Ha! I've mastered
 even the vagaries of slang in the not-language.... Ahhh! Pardon me
 again. I feel much better now.


 You see, Joe, as I attuned myself to the various impressions that
 constantly assaulted my mind through this body, I conditioned myself to
 react exactly as our information catalog instructed me to.


 Now it is all automatic, pure reflex. A sensation comes to me when I am
 burned; then I experience a burning pain. If the sensation is a tickle,
 I experience a tickle.


 This morning I have what is known medically as a syndrome ... a group
 of symptoms popularly referred to as a hangover ... Ahhh! Pardon me
 again. Strangely ... now what was I saying? Oh, yes. Ha, ha. Strangely
 enough, the reactions that come easiest to the people in this world
 came most difficult to me. Money-love, for example. It is a great thing
 here, both among those who haven't got it and those who have.


 I went out and got plenty of money. I walked invisible into a bank and
 carried away piles of it. Then I sat and looked at it. I took the money
 to a remote room of the twenty room suite I have rented in the best
 hotel here in—no, sorry—and stared at it for hours.


 Nothing happened. I didn't love the stuff or feel one way or the other
 about it. Yet all around me people are actually killing one another for
 the love of it.


 Anyway.... Ahhh. Pardon me. I got myself enough money to fill ten or
 fifteen rooms. By the end of the week I should have all eighteen spare
 rooms filled with money. If I don't love it then, I'll feel I have
 failed. This alcohol is taking effect now.


 Blgftury has been goading me for reports. To hell with his reports!
 I've got a lot more emotions to try, such as romantic love. I've been
 studying this phenomenon, along with other racial characteristics of
 these people, in the movies. This is the best place to see these
 people as they really are. They all go into the movie houses and there
 do homage to their own images. Very quaint type of idolatry.


 Love. Ha! What an adventure this is becoming.


 By the way, Joe, I'm forwarding that five dollars. You see, it won't
 cost me anything. It'll come out of the pocket of the idiot who's
 writing this letter. Pretty shrewd of me, eh?


 I'm going out and look at that money again. I think I'm at last
 learning to love it, though not as much as I admire liquor. Well, one
 simply must persevere, I always say.

 Dear Joe:


 Now you tell me not to drink alcohol. Why not? You never mentioned it
 in any of your vibrations to us, gleebs ago, when you first came across
 to this world. It will stint my powers? Nonsense! Already I have had a
 quart of the liquid today. I feel wonderful. Get that? I actually feel
 wonderful, in spite of this miserable imitation of a body.


 There are long hours during which I am so well-integrated into this
 body and this world that I almost consider myself a member of it. Now
 I can function efficiently. I sent Blgftury some long reports today
 outlining my experiments in the realm of chemistry where we must
 finally defeat these people. Of course, I haven't made the experiments
 yet, but I will. This is not deceit, merely realistic anticipation of
 the inevitable. Anyway, what the old xbyzrt doesn't know won't muss his
 vibrations.


 I went to what they call a nightclub here and picked out a
 blonde-haired woman, the kind that the books say men prefer. She was
 attracted to me instantly. After all, the body I have devised is
 perfect in every detail ... actually a not-world ideal.


 I didn't lose any time overwhelming her susceptibilities. I remember
 distinctly that just as I stooped to pick up a large roll of money I
 had dropped, her eyes met mine and in them I could see her admiration.
 We went to my suite and I showed her one of the money rooms. Would you
 believe it? She actually took off her shoes and ran around through the
 money in her bare feet! Then we kissed.


 Concealed in the dermis of the lips are tiny, highly sensitized nerve
 ends which send sensations to the brain. The brain interprets these
 impulses in a certain manner. As a result, the fate of secretion in the
 adrenals on the ends of the kidneys increases and an enlivening of the
 entire endocrine system follows. Thus I felt the beginnings of love.


 I sat her down on a pile of money and kissed her again. Again the
 tingling, again the secretion and activation. I integrated myself
 quickly.


 Now in all the motion pictures—true representations of life and love
 in this world—the man with a lot of money or virtue kisses the girl
 and tries to induce her to do something biological. She then refuses.
 This pleases both of them, for he wanted her to refuse. She, in turn,
 wanted him to want her, but also wanted to prevent him so that he would
 have a high opinion of her. Do I make myself clear?


 I kissed the blonde girl and gave her to understand what I then wanted.
 Well, you can imagine my surprise when she said yes! So I had failed. I
 had not found love.


 I became so abstracted by this problem that the blonde girl fell
 asleep. I thoughtfully drank quantities of excellent alcohol called gin
 and didn't even notice when the blonde girl left.


 I am now beginning to feel the effects of this alcohol again. Ha. Don't
 I wish old Blgftury were here in the vibrational pattern of an olive?
 I'd get the blonde in and have her eat him out of a Martini. That is a
 gin mixture.


 I think I'll get a hot report off to the old so-and-so right now. It'll
 take him a gleeb to figure this one out. I'll tell him I'm setting up
 an atomic reactor in the sewage systems here and that all we have to do
 is activate it and all the not-people will die of chain asphyxiation.


 Boy, what an easy job this turned out to be. It's just a vacation. Joe,
 you old gold-bricker, imagine you here all these gleebs living off the
 fat of the land. Yak, yak. Affectionately.

 Dear Joe:


 All is lost unless we work swiftly. I received your revealing letter
 the morning after having a terrible experience of my own. I drank a
 lot of gin for two days and then decided to go to one of these seance
 things.


 Somewhere along the way I picked up a red-headed girl. When we got
 to the darkened seance room, I took the redhead into a corner and
 continued my investigations into the realm of love. I failed again
 because she said yes immediately.


 The nerves of my dermis were working overtime when suddenly I had the
 most frightening experience of my life. Now I know what a horror these
 people really are to our world.


 The medium had turned out all the lights. He said there was a strong
 psychic influence in the room somewhere. That was me, of course, but I
 was too busy with the redhead to notice.


 Anyway, Mrs. Somebody wanted to make contact with her paternal
 grandmother, Lucy, from the beyond. The medium went into his act. He
 concentrated and sweated and suddenly something began to take form in
 the room. The best way to describe it in not-world language is a white,
 shapeless cascade of light.


 Mrs. Somebody reared to her feet and screeched, ""Grandma Lucy!"" Then I
 really took notice.


 Grandma Lucy, nothing! This medium had actually brought Blgftury
 partially across the vibration barrier. He must have been vibrating in
 the fringe area and got caught in the works. Did he look mad! His zyhku
 was open and his btgrimms were down.


 Worst of all, he saw me. Looked right at me with an unbelievable
 pattern of pain, anger, fear and amazement in his matrix. Me and the
 redhead.


 Then comes your letter today telling of the fate that befell you as a
 result of drinking alcohol. Our wrenchingly attuned faculties in these
 not-world bodies need the loathsome drug to escape from the reality
 of not-reality. It's true. I cannot do without it now. The day is only
 half over and I have consumed a quart and a half. And it is dulling all
 my powers as it has practically obliterated yours. I can't even become
 invisible any more.


 I must find the formula that will wipe out the not-world men quickly.


 Quickly!

 Dear Joe:


 This telepathic control becomes more difficult every time. I must pick
 closer points of communication soon. I have nothing to report but
 failure. I bought a ton of equipment and went to work on the formula
 that is half complete in my instructions. Six of my hotel rooms were
 filled with tubes, pipes and apparatus of all kinds.


 I had got my mechanism as close to perfect as possible when I
 realized that, in my befuddled condition, I had set off a reaction
 that inevitably would result in an explosion. I had to leave there
 immediately, but I could not create suspicion. The management was not
 aware of the nature of my activities.


 I moved swiftly. I could not afford time to bring my baggage. I
 stuffed as much money into my pockets as I could and then sauntered
 into the hotel lobby. Assuming my most casual air, I told the manager
 I was checking out. Naturally he was stunned since I was his best
 customer.


 ""But why, sir?"" he asked plaintively.


 I was baffled. What could I tell him?


 ""Don't you like the rooms?"" he persisted. ""Isn't the service good?""


 ""It's the rooms,"" I told him. ""They're—they're—""


 ""They're what?"" he wanted to know.


 ""They're not safe.""


 ""Not safe? But that is ridiculous. This hotel is....""


 At this point the blast came. My nerves were a wreck from the alcohol.


 ""See?"" I screamed. ""Not safe. I knew they were going to blow up!""


 He stood paralyzed as I ran from the lobby. Oh, well, never say die.
 Another day, another hotel. I swear I'm even beginning to think like
 the not-men, curse them.

 Dear Joe:


 I have it! It is done! In spite of the alcohol, in spite of Blgftury's
 niggling criticism, I have succeeded. I now have developed a form
 of mold, somewhat similar to the antibiotics of this world, that,
 transmitted to the human organism, will cause a disease whose end will
 be swift and fatal.


 First the brain will dissolve and then the body will fall apart.
 Nothing in this world can stop the spread of it once it is loose.
 Absolutely nothing.


 We must use care. Stock in as much gin as you are able. I will bring
 with me all that I can. Meanwhile I must return to my original place of
 birth into this world of horrors. There I will secure the gateway, a
 large mirror, the vibrational point at which we shall meet and slowly
 climb the frequency scale to emerge into our own beautiful, now secure
 world. You and I together, Joe, conquerors, liberators.


 You say you eat little and drink as much as you can. The same with
 me. Even in this revolting world I am a sad sight. My not-world senses
 falter. This is the last letter. Tomorrow I come with the gateway. When
 the gin is gone, we will plant the mold in the hotel where you live.


 In only a single gleeb it will begin to work. The men of this queer
 world will be no more. But we can't say we didn't have some fun, can
 we, Joe?


 And just let Blgftury make one crack. Just one xyzprlt. I'll have
 hgutry before the ghjdksla!

With the People of the World Wide Web communicating more fully and
 freely in Social Media while rallying a Web 2.0 content boom, the inner
 dynamics of such a creative explosion must be studied more closely. What
 motivates those who join this movement and what future will they create?
 A key fact is that a superabundance of community respect and social
 capital are being accumulated by those who share. The key motivator of
 Social Media and the core spirit of Web 2.0 is a mind switch called
 Sharism. Sharism suggests a re-orientation of personal values. We see it
 in User Generated Content. It is the pledge of Creative Commons. It is
 in the plans of future-oriented cultural initiatives. Sharism is also a
 mental practice that anyone can try, a social-psychological attitude to
 transform a wide and isolated world into a super-smart Social Brain.
The Neuron Doctrine
Sharism is encoded in the Human Genome. Although eclipsed by the many
 pragmatisms of daily life, the theory of Sharism finds basis in
 neuroscience and its study of the working model of the human brain.
 Although we can’t entirely say how the brain works as a whole, we do
 have a model of the functional mechanism of the nervous system and its
 neurons. A neuron is not a simple organic cell, but a very powerful,
 electrically excitable biological processor. Groups of neurons form
 vastly interconnected networks, which, by changing the strength of the
 synapses between cells, can process information, and learn. A neuron, by
 sharing chemical signals with its neighbors, can be integrated into more
 meaningful patterns that keep the neuron active and alive. Moreover,
 such a simple logic can be iterated and amplified, since all neurons
 work on a similar principle of connecting and sharing. Originally, the
 brain is quite open. A neural network exists to share activity and
 information, and I believe this model of the brain should inspire ideas
 and decisions about human networks.
Thus, our brain supports sharing in its very system-nature. This has
 profound implications for the creative process. Whenever you have an
 intention to create, you will find it easier to generate more creative
 ideas if you keep the sharing process firmly in mind. The
 idea-forming-process is not linear, but more like an avalanche of
 amplifications along the thinking path. It moves with the momentum of a
 creative snowball. If your internal cognitive system encourages sharing,
 you can engineer a feedback loop of happiness, which will help you
 generate even more ideas in return. It’s a kind of butterfly- effect, as
 the small creative energy you spend will eventually return to make you,
 and the world, more creative.
However, daily decisions for most adults are quite low in creative
 productivity, if only because they’ve switched off their sharing paths.
 People generally like to share what they create, but in a culture that
 tells them to be protective of their ideas, people start to believe in
 the danger of sharing. Then Sharism will be degraded in their mind and
 not encouraged in their society. But if we can encourage someone to
 share, her sharing paths will stay open. Sharism will be kept in her
 mind as a memory and an instinct. If in the future she faces a creative
 choice, her choice will be, “Share.”
These mind-switches are too subtle to be felt. But since the brain, and
 society, is a connected system, the accumulation of these
 micro-attitudes, from neuron to neuron and person to person, can result
 in observable behavior. It is easy to tell if a person, a group, a
 company, a nation is oriented toward Sharism or not. For those who are
 not, what they defend as “cultural goods” and “intellectual property”
 are just excuses for the status quo of keeping a community closed. Much
 of their “culture” will be protected, but the net result is the direct
 loss of many other precious ideas, and the subsequent loss of all the
 potential gains of sharing. This lost knowledge is a black hole in our
 life, which may start to swallow other values as well.
Non-sharing culture misleads us with its absolute separation of Private
 and Public space. It makes creative action a binary choice between
 public and private, open and closed. This creates a gap in the spectrum
 of knowledge. Although this gap has the potential to become a valuable
 creative space, concerns about privacy make this gap hard to fill. We
 shouldn’t be surprised that, to be safe, most people keep their sharing
 private and stay “closed.” They may fear the Internet creates a
 potential for abuse that they can’t fight alone. However, the paradox
 is: The less you share, the less power you have.
New Technologies and the Rise of Sharism
Let’s track back to 1999, when there were only a few hundred pioneer
 bloggers around the world, and no more than ten times that many readers
 following each blog. Human history is always so: something important was
 happening, but the rest of the world hadn’t yet realized it. The shift
 toward easy-to-use online publishing triggered a soft revolution in just
 five years. People made a quick and easy transition from reading blogs,
 to leaving comments and taking part in online conversations, and then to
 the sudden realization that they should become bloggers themselves. More
 bloggers created more readers, and more readers made more blogs. The
 revolution was viral.
Bloggers generate lively and timely information on the Internet, and
 connect to each other with RSS, hyperlinks, comments, trackbacks and
 quotes. The small-scale granularity of the content can fill discrete
 gaps in experience and thus record a new human history. Once you become
 a blogger, once you have accumulated so much social capital in such a
 small site, it’s hard to stop. We can’t explain this fact with a theory
 of addiction. It’s an impulse to share. It’s the energy of the memes
 that want to be passed from mouth to mouth and mind to mind. It’s more
 than just E-mail. It’s Sharism.
Bloggers are always keen to keep the social context of their posts in
 mind, by asking themselves, “Who is going to see this?” Bloggers are
 agile in adjusting their tone−and privacy settings−to advance ideas and
 stay out of trouble. It’s not self-censorship, but a sense of smart
 expression. But once blogs reached the tipping point, they expanded into
 the blogosphere. This required a more delicate social networking system
 and content- sharing architecture. But people now understand that they
 can have better control over a wide spectrum of relationships. Like how
 Flickr allows people to share their photos widely, but safely. The
 checkbox-based privacy of Flickr may seem unfamiliar to a new user, but
 you can use it to toy with the mind-switches of Sharism. By checking a
 box we can choose to share or not to share. From my observations, I have
 seen photographers on Flickr become more open to sharing, while
 retaining flexible choices.
The rapid emergence of Social Applications that can communicate and
 cooperate, by allowing people to output content from one service to
 another, is letting users pump their memes into a pipeline-like
 ecosystem. This interconnectedness allows memes to travel along multiple
 online social networks, and potentially reach a huge audience. As a
 result, such a Micro-pipeline system is making Social Media a true
 alternative to broadcast media. These new technologies are reviving
 Sharism in our closed culture.
Local Practice, Global Gain
If you happened to lose your Sharism in a bad educational or cultural
 setting, it’s hard to get it back. But it’s not impossible. A
 persistence of practice can lead to a full recovery. You can think of
 Sharism as a spiritual practice. But you must practice everyday.
 Otherwise, you might lose the power of sharing. Permanently.
You might need something to spur you on, to keep you from quitting and
 returning to a closed mindset. Here’s an idea: put a sticky note on your
 desk that says, “What do you want to share today?” I’m not kidding.
 Then, if anything interesting comes your way: Share It! The easiest way
 to both start and keep sharing is by using different kinds of social
 software applications. Your first meme you want to share may be small,
 but you can amplify it with new technologies. Enlist some people from
 your network and invite them into a new social application. At first it
 might be hard to feel the gains of Sharism. The true test then is to see
 if you can keep track of the feedback that you get from sharing. You
 will realize that almost all sharing activities will generate positive
 results. The happiness that this will obtain is only the most immediate
 reward. But there are others.
The first type of reward that you will get comes in the form of
 comments. Then you know you’ve provoked interest, appreciation,
 excitement. The second reward is access to all the other stuff being
 shared by friends in your network. Since you know and trust them, you
 will be that much more interested in what they have to share. Already,
 the return is a multiple of the small meme you first shared. But the
 third type of return is more dramatic still. Anything you share can be
 forwarded, circulated and republished via other people’s networks. This
 cascade effect can spread your work to the networked masses.
Improvements in social software are making the speed of dissemination as
 fast as a mouse-click. You should get to know the Sharism-You. You’re
 about to become popular, and fast
This brings us to the fourth and final type of return. It has a meaning
 not only for you, but for the whole of society. If you so choose, you
 may allow others to create derivative works from what you share. This
 one choice could easily snowball into more creations along the sharing
 path, from people at key nodes in the network who are all as passionate
 about creating and sharing as you are. After many iterative rounds of
 development, a large creative work may spring from your choice to share.
 Of course, you will get the credit that you asked for, and deserve. And
 it’s okay to seek financial rewards. But you will in every case get
 something just as substantial: Happiness.
The more people who create in the spirit of Sharism, the easier it will
 be to attain well- balanced and equitable Social Media that is woven by
 people themselves. Media won’t be controlled by any single person but
 will rely on the even distribution of social networking. These “Shaeros”
 (Sharing Heroes) will naturally become the opinion leaders in the first
 wave of Social Media. However, these media rights will belong to
 everyone. You yourself can be both producer and consumer in such a
 system.
Sharism Safeguards Your Rights
Still, many questions will be raised about Sharism as an initiative in
 new age. The main one is copyright. One concern is that any loss of
 control over copyrighted content will lead to noticeable deficits in
 personal wealth, or just loss of control. 5 years ago, I would have said
 that this was a possibility. But things are changing today. The sharing
 environment is more protected than you might think. Many new social
 applications make it easy to set terms-of-use along your sharing path.
 Any infringement of those terms will be challenged not just by the law,
 but by your community. Your audience, who benefit form your sharing, can
 also be the gatekeepers of your rights. Even if you are a traditional
 copyright holder, this sounds ideal.
Furthermore, by realizing all the immediate and emergent rewards that
 can be had by sharing, you may eventually find that copyright and “All
 Rights Reserved” are far from your mind. You will enjoy sharing too much
 to worry about who is keeping a copy. The new economic formula is, the
 more people remix your works, the higher the return.
I want to point out that Sharism is not Communism, nor Socialism. As for
 those die- hard Communists we know, they have often abused people’s
 sharing nature and forced them to give up their rights, and their
 property. Socialism, that tender Communism, in our experience also
 lacked respect for these rights. Under these systems, the state owns all
 property. Under Sharism, you can keep ownership, if you want. But I like
 to share. And this is how I choose to spread ideas, and prosperity
Sharism is totally based on your own consensus. It’s not a very hard
 concept to understand, especially since copyleft movements like the Free
 Software Foundation and Creative Commons have been around for years.
 These movements are redefining a more flexible spectrum of licenses for
 both developers and end-users to tag their works. Because the new
 licenses can be recognized by either humans or machines, it’s becoming
 easier to re-share those works in new online ecosystems.
The Spirit of the Web, a Social Brain
Sharism is the Spirit of the Age of Web 2.0. It has the consistency of a
 naturalized Epistemology and modernized Axiology, but also promises the
 power of a new Internet philosophy. Sharism will transform the world
 into an emergent Social Brain: a networked hybrid of people and
 software. We are Networked Neurons connected by the synapses of Social
 Software.
This is an evolutionary leap, a small step for us and a giant one for
 human society. With new “hairy” emergent technologies sprouting all
 around us, we can generate higher connectivities and increase the
 throughput of our social links. The more open and strongly connected we
 social neurons are, the better the sharing environment will be for all
 people. The more collective our intelligence, the wiser our actions will
 be. People have always found better solutions through conversations. Now
 we can put it all online.
Sharism will be the politics of the next global superpower. It will not
 be a country, but a new human network joined by Social Software. This
 may remain a distant dream, and even a well-defined public sharing
 policy might not be close at hand. But the ideas that I’m discussing can
 improve governments today. We can integrate our current and emerging
 democratic systems with new folksonomies (based on the collaborative,
 social indexing of information) to enable people to make queries, share
 data and remix information for public use. The collective intelligence
 of a vast and equitable sharing environment can be the gatekeeper of our
 rights, and a government watchdog. In the future, policymaking can be
 made more nuanced with the micro-involvement of the sharing community.
 This “Emergent Democracy” is more real-time than periodical
 parliamentary sessions. It will also increase the spectrum of our
 choices, beyond the binary options of “Yes” or “No” referenda.
 Representative democracy will become more timely and diligent, because
 we will represent ourselves within the system.
Sharism will result in better social justice. In a healthy sharing
 environment, any evidence of injustice can get amplified to get the
 public’s attention. Anyone who has been abused can get real and instant
 support from her peers and her peers’ peers. Appeals to justice will
 take the form of petitions through multiple, interconnected channels.
 Using these tools, anyone can create a large social impact. With
 multiple devices and many social applications, each of us can become
 more sociable, and society more individual. We no longer have to act
 alone.
Emergent democracy will only happen when Sharism becomes the literacy of
 the majority. Since Sharism can improve communication, collaboration and
 mutual understanding, I believe it has a place within the educational
 system. Sharism can be applied to any cultural discourse, CoP (Community
 of Practice) or problem-solving context. It is also an antidote to
 social depression, since sharelessness is just dragging our society
 down. In present or formerly totalitarian countries, this downward cycle
 is even more apparent. The future world will be a hybrid of human and
 machine that will generate better and faster decisions anytime,
 anywhere. The flow of information between minds will become more
 flexible and more productive. These vast networks of sharing will create
 a new social order−A Mind Revolution!

20015,20015_X491ZF32,12,1004,Slate,Goings On About Town,1998,Jim Holt,Periodicals; Specialized Magazine; Media Coverage,"Goings On About Town 

         One of the funniest moments in Brendan Gill's 1975 memoir, Here at ""The New Yorker ,"" comes during a luncheon at the now vanished Ritz in Manhattan. At the table are Gill; William Shawn, then editor of The New Yorker ; and the reclusive English writer Henry Green. Green's new novel, Loving , has just received a very favorable review in The New Yorker . Shawn--""with his usual hushed delicacy of speech and manner""--inquires of the novelist whether he could possibly reveal what prompted the creation of such an exquisite work. Green obliges. ""I once asked an old butler in Ireland what had been the happiest times of his life,"" he says. ""The butler replied, 'Lying in bed on Sunday morning, eating tea and toast with cunty fingers.' "" 

         This was not the explanation Shawn was expecting, Gill tells us. ""Discs of bright red begin to burn in his cheeks."" 

         Was Shawn blushing out of prudishness, as we are meant to infer? This was, after all, a man renowned for his retiring propriety, a man who sedulously barred anything smacking of the salacious--from lingerie ads to four-letter words--from the magazine he stewarded from 1952 until 1987, five years before his death. But after reading these two new memoirs about Shawn, I wonder. ""He longed for the earthiest and wildest kinds of sexual adventures,"" Lillian Ross discloses in hers, adding that he lusted after Hannah Arendt, Evonne Goolagong, and Madonna. As for Ved Mehta, he reports that Shawn's favorite thing to watch on television was ""people dancing uninhibitedly"" ( Soul Train , one guesses). I suspect Shawn did not blush at the ""cunty fingers"" remark out of prudery. He blushed because it had hit too close to home. 

         Both these memoirs must be read by everyone--everyone, that is, who takes seriously the important business of sorting out precisely how he or she feels about The New Yorker , then and now. Of the two, Mehta's is far and away the more entertaining. This may seem odd, for Mehta is reputed to be a very dull writer whereas Ross is a famously zippy one. Moreover, Mehta writes as Shawn's adoring acolyte, whereas Ross writes as his longtime adulterous lover. Just knowing that Mrs. Shawn is still alive adds a certain tension to reading much of what this Other Woman chooses to divulge. Evidently, ""Bill"" and Lillian loved each other with a fine, pure love, a love that was more than love, a love coveted by the winged seraphs of heaven. ""We had indeed become one,"" she tells us, freely venting the inflations of her heart. 

          Shawn was managing editor of The New Yorker when he hired Ross in 1945 as the magazine's second woman reporter (the first was Andy Logan). He was short and balding but had pale blue eyes to die for. As for Ross, ""I was aware of the fact that I was not unappealing."" During a late-night editorial session, she says, Shawn blurted out his love. A few weeks later at the office, their eyes met. Without a word--even, it seems, to the cab driver--they hied uptown to the Plaza, where matters were consummated. Thereafter, the couple set up housekeeping together in an apartment 20 blocks downtown from the Shawn residence on upper Fifth Avenue and stoically endured the sufferings of Shawn's wife, who did not want a divorce. 

         Now, Ross seems like a nice lady, and I certainly have nothing against adultery, which I hear is being carried on in the best circles these days. But the public flaunting of adultery--especially when spouses and children are around--well, it brings out the bourgeois in me. It also made me feel funny about William Shawn, whom I have always regarded as a great man. I loved his New Yorker . The prose it contained--the gray stuff around the cartoons--was balm for the soul: unfailingly clear, precise, logical, and quietly stylish. So what if the articles were occasionally boring? It was a sweet sort of boredom, serene and restorative, not at all like the kind induced by magazines today, which is more akin to nervous exhaustion. Besides, the moral tone of the magazine was almost wholly admirable--it was ahead of the pack on Hiroshima, civil rights, Vietnam, Watergate, the environment--and this was very much Shawn's doing. I do not like to think of him in an illicit love nest, eating tea and toast with cunty fingers. 

         Happily, Ross has sprinkled her memoir with clues that it is not to be taken as entirely factual. To say that Shawn was ""a man who grieved over all living creatures"" is forgivable hyperbole; but later to add that he ""mourned"" for Si Newhouse when Newhouse unceremoniously fired him in 1987 (a couple of years after buying the magazine)--well, that's a bit much. Even Jesus had his limits. 

         Elsewhere, Ross refers to her lover's ""very powerful masculinity,"" only to note on the very next page that ""if he suffered a paper cut on a finger and saw blood, he would come into my office, looking pale."" She declares that ""Bill was incapable of engendering a cliché, in deed as well as in word."" But then she puts the most toe-curling clichés into his mouth: ""Why am I more ghost than man?"" Or: ""We must arrest our love in midflight. And we fix it forever as of today, a point of pure light that will reach into eternity."" (File that under Romantic Effusions We Doubt Ever Got Uttered.) Nor is Ross incapable of a melodramatic cliché herself. ""Why can't we just live, just live ?"" she cries in anguish when she and Shawn, walking hand in hand out of Central Park, chance to see Shawn's wife slowly making her way down the block with a burden of packages. 

          And what does she think of Mrs. Shawn? ""I found her to be sensitive and likeable."" Plus, she could ""do a mean Charleston."" There is nothing more poignant than the image of an openly cheated-upon and humiliated wife doing ""a mean Charleston."" 

         William Shawn's indispensability as an editor is amply manifest in Ross' memoir. Word repetition? ""Whatever reporting Bill asked me to do turned out to be both challenging and fun. ... For me, reporting and writing for the magazine was fun, pure fun. ... It was never 'work' for me. It was fun."" Even in praising his skill as an editor, she betrays the presence of its absence. ""All writers, of course, have needed the one called the 'editor,' who singularly, almost mystically, embodies the many-faceted, unique life force infusing the entire enchilada."" Nice touch, that enchilada. 

         When cocktail party malcontents mocked Shawn's New Yorker in the late '70s and early '80s, they would make fun of such things as E.J. Kahn's five-part series on ""Grains of the World"" or Elizabeth Drew's supposedly soporific reporting from Washington. But Ved Mehta was always the butt of the worst abuse. Shawn was allowing him to publish an autobiography in the pages of the magazine that was mounting up to millions of words over the years, and the very idea of it seemed to bore people silly. After the publication of two early installments, ""Daddyji"" and ""Mamaji,"" each the length of a book, one critic cried: ""Enoughji!"" 

         But it kept coming. And I, for one, was grateful. Here was a boy growing up in Punjab during the fall of the Raj and the Partition, a boy who had been blinded by meningitis at the age of 3, roller-skating through the back streets of Lahore as Sikhs slaughtered Hindus and Hindus slaughtered Muslims and civilization was collapsing and then, decades later, having made his way from India to an Arkansas school for the blind to Balliol College, Oxford, to The New Yorker , re-creating the whole thing in Proustian detail and better-than-Proustian prose ... ! 

          Mehta's multivolume autobiography, titled Continents of Exile , has loss as its overarching theme: loss of sight, of childhood, of home and country, and now--with this volume--loss of Mr. Shawn's New Yorker . The memoir takes us from the time the author was hired as a staff writer in the early '60s up to 1994, when he was ""terminated"" by the loathed Tina Brown in her vandalization of his cherished magazine. Mehta evidently loved William Shawn at least as much as Lillian Ross did, although his love was not requited in the same way. He likens the revered editor to the character Prince Myshkin in The Idiot : innocent and vulnerable, someone who must be protected. And long-suffering, one might infer: ""He was so careful of not hurting anyone's feelings that he often listened to utterly fatuous arguments for hours on end."" 

         Like Ross, Mehta struggles to express William Shawn's ineffable virtues. ""It is as if, Mehta, he were beyond our human conception,"" Janet Flanner tells him once to calm him down. At times I wondered whether the author, in his ecstasies of devotion, had not inadvertently committed plagiarism. His words on Mr. Shawn sound suspiciously like those of Mr. Pooter on his boss Mr. Perkupp in The Diary of a Nobody . Compare. Mehta on Shawn: ""His words were so generous that I could scarcely find my tongue, even to thank him."" Pooter on Perkupp: ""My heart was too full to thank him."" Mehta: ""I started saying to myself compulsively, 'I wish Mr. Shawn would ring,' at the oddest times of the day or night. ... How I longed for the parade of proofs, the excitement of rewriting and perfecting!"" Pooter: ""Mr. Perkupp, I will work night and day to serve you!"" 

         I am not sure I have made it sound this way so far, but Mehta's book is completely engrossing--the most enjoyable book, I think, I have ever reviewed. It oozes affection and conviction, crackles with anger, and is stuffed with thumping good stories. Many are about Mehta's daft colleagues at The New Yorker , such as the guy in the next office: 

         His door was always shut, but I could hear him through the wall that separated his cubicle from mine typing without pause. ... Even the changing of the paper in the typewriter seemed somehow to be incorporated into the rhythmic rat-tat-tat ... year after year went by to the sound of his typing but without a word from his typewriter appearing in the magazine. 

         Or the great and eccentric Irish writer Maeve Breenan, who fetched up as a bag lady. Or the legendary St. Clair McKelway, whose decisive breakdown came when he hailed a cab and prevailed upon the driver to take him to the New Yorker office at 24 West 43 rd St. ""O.K., Mac, if that's what you want."" He was in Boston at the time. (McKelway later told Mehta that if the cabby had not called him ""Mac,"" his nickname, an alarm might have gone off in his head.) 

         Mehta's writerly persona, a disarming mixture of the feline and the naive, is perfect for relating the little scandals that worried The New Yorker in the late '70s (plagiarism, frozen turbot), the drama of finding a worthy candidate to succeed the aging Shawn as editor, the purchase of the magazine by the evil Si Newhouse (""We all took fright"") and the resultant plague of Gottliebs and Florios visited upon it, and what he sees as the final debacle: Tinaji. 

          Lillian Ross, by contrast, takes a rather cheerful view of the Brown dispensation. Indeed, the new editor even coaxed Ross into re-joining the magazine, just as she was booting Mehta out. ""I found that she possessed--under the usual disguises--her own share of Bill's kind of naivete, insight, and sensitivity,"" Ross says of Brown. ""She, too, 'got it.' "" A few months after Brown was appointed editor, Shawn died at the age of 85. He had long since stopped reading his beloved magazine, in sorrow and relief. That's if you believe Mehta. Ross assures us that Mr. Shawn was reading Tina Brown's New Yorker ""with new interest"" in the weeks prior to his death. 

         Has Tina Brown betrayed the legacy of William Shawn, as Mehta fiercely believes, or has she continued and built upon it, as Ross is evidently convinced? Have the changes she has wrought enlivened a stodgy magazine or vulgarized a dignified one--or both? These are weighty questions, and one is of course loath to compromise one's life chances by hazarding unripe opinions in a public forum such as this.

What better way to use a time machine than
 
to handle department store complaints? But
 
pleasing  a customer should have its limits!
The Christmas party at the Boston branch of Hartshorne-Logan was
 threatening to become more legendary than usual this Christmas.


 The farm machinery manager had already collapsed. When he slid under
 the table containing the drinks, Miss Pringle, who sold millinery, had
 screamed: ""He'll drown!""


 One out of every three dirty stories started by party attendees had
 remained unfinished, because each had reminded someone else of another
 story.


 The recently developed liquors which affected the bloodstream three
 times faster had driven away twinges of conscience about untrimmed
 trees and midnight church services.


 The star salesman for mankies and the gentleman who was in charge of
 the janitors were putting on a display of Burmese foot-wrestling in
 one corner of the general office. The janitor foreman weighed fifty
 pounds less than the Burma gentleman, who was the salesman's customary
 opponent. So the climax of one tactic did not simply overturn the
 foreman. He glided through the air, crashing with a very loud thump
 against the wall.


 He wasn't hurt. But the impact knocked the hallowed portrait of H. H.
 Hartshorne, co-founder, from its nail. It tinkled imposingly as its
 glass splintered against the floor.
The noise caused a temporary lull in the gaiety. Several employes even
 felt a passing suspicion that things might be getting out of hand.


 ""It's all in the spirit of good, clean fun!"" cried Mr. Hawkins, the
 assistant general manager. Since he was the highest executive present,
 worries vanished. Everyone felt fine. There was a scurry to shove the
 broken glass out of sight and to turn more attention to another type of
 glasses.


 Mr. Hawkins himself, acting by reflex, attempted to return the portrait
 to its place until new glass could be obtained. But the fall had sprung
 the frame at one corner and it wouldn't hang straight.


 ""We'd better put old H. H. away for safekeeping until after the
 holiday,"" he told a small, blonde salesclerk who was beneath his
 attention on any working day.


 With the proper mixture of respect and bonhommie, he lifted the heavy
 picture out of its frame. A yellowed envelope slipped to the floor as
 the picture came free. Hawkins rolled the picture like a scroll and put
 it into a desk drawer, for later attention. Then he looked around for a
 drink that would make him feel even better.


 A sorting clerk in the mail order department wasn't used to liquor. She
 picked up the envelope and looked around vaguely for the mail-opening
 machine.


 ""Hell, Milly, you aren't working!"" someone shouted at her. ""Have
 another!""


 Milly snapped out of it. She giggled, suppressed a ladylike belch and
 returned to reality. Looking at the envelope, she said: ""Oh, I see.
 They must have stuck it in to tighten the frame. Gee, it's old.""


 Mr. Hawkins had refreshed himself. He decided that he liked Milly's
 voice. To hear more of it, he said to her: ""I'll bet that's been in
 there ever since the picture was framed. There's a company legend that
 that picture was put up the day this branch opened, eighty years ago.""


 ""I didn't know the company ever used buff envelopes like this."" Milly
 turned it over in her hands. The ancient glue crackled as she did so.
 The flap popped open and an old-fashioned order blank fell out.


 Mr. Hawkins' eyes widened. He bent, reached painfully over his potbelly
 and picked up the order form.


 ""This thing has never been processed!"" Raising his voice, he shouted
 jovially, ""Hey, people! You're all fired! Here's an order that
 Hartshorne-Logan never filled! We can't have such carelessness. This
 poor woman has waited eighty years for her merchandise!""
Milly was reading aloud the scrawled words on the order form:


 ""Best electric doorbell. Junior detective kit. Disposable sacks for
 vacuum cleaner. Dress for three-year-old girl."" She turned to the
 assistant general manager, struck with an idea for the first time in
 her young life. ""Let's fill this order right now!""


 ""The poor woman must be dead by now,"" he objected, secretly angry
 that he hadn't thought of such a fine party stunt himself. Then he
 brightened. ""Unless—"" he said it loud enough for the employes to scent
 a great proposal and the room grew quiet—""unless we broke the rules
 just once and used the time warp on a big mission!""


 There was a silence. Finally, from an anonymous voice in one corner:
 ""Would the warp work over eighty years? We were always told that it
 must be used only for complaints within three days.""


 ""Then let's find out!"" Mr. Hawkins downed the rest of his drink and
 pulled a batch of keys from his pocket. ""Someone scoot down to the
 warehouse. Tell the watchman that it's on my authority. Hunt up the
 stuff that's on the order. Get the best of everything. Ignore the
 catalogue numbers—they've changed a hundred times in all these years.""


 Milly was still deciphering the form. Now she let out a little squeal
 of excitement.


 ""Look, Mr. Hawkins! The name on this order—it's my great-grandmother!
 Isn't that wonderful? I was just a little girl when she died. I can
 barely remember her as a real old woman. But I remember that my
 grandmother never bought anything from Hartshorne-Logan because of some
 trouble her mother had once with the firm. My mother didn't want me to
 come to work here because of that.""


 Mr. Hawkins put his arm around Milly in a way that he intended to
 look fatherly. It didn't. ""Well, now. Since it's your relative, let's
 thrill the old girl. We wouldn't have vacuum sacks any more. So we'll
 substitute a manky!""
Ann Hartley was returning from mailing the letter when she found the
 large parcel on her doorstep. She put her hands on her hips and stared
 pugnaciously at the bundle.


 ""The minute I write a letter to complain about you, you turn up!"" she
 told the parcel. She nudged her toe peevishly against the brown paper
 wrappings that were tied with a half-transparent twine she had never
 seen before.


 The label was addressed in a wandering scrawl, a sharp contrast to
 the impersonal typing on the customary Hartshorne-Logan bundles. But
 the familiar RATTLE OK sticker was pasted onto the box, indicating to
 the delivery man that the contents would make a rattling sound and
 therefore hadn't been broken in shipment.


 Ann sighed and picked up her bundle. With a last look at the lovely
 spring afternoon and the quiet suburban landscape, she went into the
 house.


 Two-year-old Sally heard the box rattling. She waddled up on chubby
 legs and grabbed her mother's skirt. ""Want!"" she said decisively.


 ""Your dress ought to be here,"" Ann said. She found scissors in her
 sewing box, tossed a cushion onto the floor, sat on it, and began to
 open the parcel.


 ""Now I'll have to write another letter to explain that they should
 throw away my letter of complaint,"" she told her daughter. ""And by the
 time they get my second letter, they'll have answered my first letter.
 Then they'll write again."" Out of consideration for Sally, she omitted
 the expletives that she wanted to add.


 The translucent cord was too tough for the scissors. Ann was about to
 hunt for a razor blade when Sally clutched at an intersection of the
 cord and yanked. The twine sprang away from the carton as if it were
 alive. The paper wrappings flapped open.


 ""There!"" Sally said.


 Ann repressed an irrational urge to slap her daughter. Instead, she
 tossed the wrappings aside and removed the lid from the carton. A
 slightly crushed thin cardboard box lay on top. Ann pulled out the
 dress and shook it into a freely hanging position. Then she groaned.


 It was green and she had ordered blue. It didn't remotely resemble
 the dress she had admired from the Hartshorne-Logan catalogue
 illustration. Moreover, the shoulders were lumpier than any small
 girl's dress should be.


 But Sally was delighted. ""Mine!"" she shrilled, grabbing for the dress.


 ""It's probably the wrong size, too,"" Ann said, pulling off Sally's
 dress to try it on. ""Let's find as many things to complain about as we
 can.""
The dress fitted precisely, except for the absurd shoulder bumps. Sally
 was radiant for a moment. Then her small face sobered and she started
 to look vacantly at the distant wall.


 ""We'll have to send it back,"" Ann said, ""and get the one we ordered.""


 She tried to take it off, but the child squawked violently. Ann grabbed
 her daughter's arms, held them above her head and pulled at the dress.
 It seemed to be stuck somewhere. When Ann released the child's arms to
 loosen the dress, Sally squirmed away. She took one step forward, then
 began to float three inches above the ground. She landed just before
 she collided with the far wall.
Sally looked scared until she saw her mother's face. Then she squealed
 in delight.


 Ann's legs were rubber. She was shaking her head and wobbling
 uncertainly toward her daughter when the door opened behind her.


 ""It's me,"" her husband said. ""Slow day at the office, so I came home
 early.""


 ""Les! I'm going crazy or something. Sally just—""


 Sally crouched to jump at her father. Before she could leap, he grabbed
 her up bodily and hugged her. Then he saw the box.


 ""Your order's here? Good. What's this thing?"" He was looking at a small
 box he had pulled from the carton. Its lid contained a single word:
 MANKY. The box rattled when he shook it.


 Les pulled off the lid and found inside a circular, shiny metal object.
 A triangular trio of jacks stuck out from one end.


 ""Is this the doorbell? I've never seen a plug like this. And there's no
 wire.""


 ""I don't know,"" Ann said. ""Les, listen. A minute ago, Sally—""


 He peered into the box for an instruction sheet, uselessly. ""They must
 have made a mistake. It looks like some kind of farm equipment.""


 He tossed the manky onto the hassock and delved into the carton again.
 Sally was still in his arms.


 ""That's the doorbell, I think,"" he said, looking at the next object. It
 had a lovely, tubular shape, a half-dozen connecting rods and a plug
 for a wall socket.


 ""That's funny,"" Ann mused, her mind distracted from Sally for a moment.
 ""It looks terribly expensive. Maybe they sent door chimes instead of
 the doorbell.""


 The bottom of the carton contained the detective outfit that they had
 ordered for their son. Ann glanced at its glaringly lithographed cover
 and said: ""Les, about Sally. Put her down a minute and watch what she
 does.""
Les stared at his wife and put the child onto the rug. Sally began to
 walk, then rose and again floated, this time toward the hassock on
 which the manky lay.


 His jaw dropped. ""My God! Ann, what—""


 Ann was staring, too, but not at her daughter. ""Les! The hassock! It
 used to be brown!""


 The hassock was a livid shade of green. A neon, demanding, screaming
 green that clashed horribly with the soft browns and reds in which Ann
 had furnished the room.


 ""That round thing must be leaking,"" Les said. ""But did you see Sally
 when she—""


 Ann's frazzled nerves carried a frantic order to her muscles. She
 jumped up, strode to the hassock and picked up the manky with two
 fingers. She tossed it to Les. Immediately, she regretted her action.


 ""Drop it!"" she yelled. ""Maybe it'll turn you green, too!""


 Les kicked the hassock into the hall closet, tossed the manky in after
 it and shut the door firmly. As the door closed, he saw the entire
 interior of the dark closet brighten into a wet-lettuce green.


 When he turned back to Ann, she was staring at her left hand. The
 wedding band that Les had put there a dozen years ago was a brilliant
 green, shedding its soft glow over the finger up to the first knuckle.


 Ann felt the scream building up inside her. She opened her mouth to let
 it out, then put her hand in front of her mouth to keep it in, finally
 jerked the hand away to prevent the glowing ring from turning her front
 teeth green.


 She collapsed into Les's arms, babbling incomprehensibly.


 He said: ""It's all right. There must be balloons or something in the
 shoulders of that dress. I'll tie a paperweight to Sally's dress and
 that'll hold her down until we undress her. Don't worry. And that green
 dye or whatever it is will wash off.""


 Ann immediately felt better. She put her hands behind her back, pulled
 off her ring and slipped it into her apron pocket. Les was sentimental
 about her removing it.


 ""I'll get dinner,"" she said, trying to keep her voice on an even keel.
 ""Maybe you'd better start a letter to Hartshorne-Logan. Let's go into
 the kitchen, Sally.""


 Ann strode resolutely toward the rear of the house. She kept her eyes
 determinedly off the tinge of green that was showing through the apron
 pocket and didn't dare look back at her daughter's unsettling means of
 propulsion.
A half-hour later, when the meal was almost ready, two things happened:
 Bob came home from school through the back door and a strange voice
 said from the front of the house, ""Don't answer the front door.""


 Ann stared at her son. He stared back at her, the detective outfit
 under his arm.


 She went into the front room. Her husband was standing with fists on
 hips, looking at the front door, chuckling. ""Neatest trick I've seen
 in a long time. That voice you heard was the new doorbell. I put it up
 while you were in the kitchen. Did you hear what happened when old lady
 Burnett out there pushed the button?""


 ""Oh. Something like those name cards with something funny printed on
 them, like 'Another hour shot.' Well, if there's a little tape in there
 repeating that message, you'd better shut that part off. It might get
 boring after a while. And it might insult someone.""


 Ann went to the door and turned the knob. The door didn't open. The
 figure of Mrs. Burnett, half-visible through the heavy curtain, shifted
 impatiently on the porch.


 Les yanked at the doorknob. It didn't yield for him, either. He looked
 up at the doorbell, which he had installed just above the upper part
 of the door frame.


 ""Queer,"" he said. ""That isn't in contact with the door itself. I don't
 see how it can keep the door from opening.""


 Ann put her mouth close to the glass, shouting: ""Won't you come to the
 back door, Mrs. Burnett? This one is stuck.""


 ""I just wanted to borrow some sugar,"" the woman cried from the porch.
 ""I realize that I'm a terrible bother."" But she walked down the front
 steps and disappeared around the side of the house.


 ""Don't open the back door."" The well-modulated voice from the small
 doorbell box threatened to penetrate every corner of the house. Ann
 looked doubtfully at her husband's lips. They weren't moving.


 ""If this is ventriloquism—"" she began icily.


 ""I'll have to order another doorbell just like this one, for the
 office,"" Les said. ""But you'd better let the old girl in. No use
 letting her get peeved.""


 The back door was already open, because it was a warm day. The screen
 door had no latch, held closed by a simple spring. Ann pushed it open
 when Mrs. Burnett waddled up the three back steps, and smiled at her
 neighbor.


 ""I'm so sorry you had to walk around the house. It's been a rather
 hectic day in an awful lot of ways.""
Something seemed to impede Mrs. Burnett as she came to the threshold.
 She frowned and shoved her portly frame against something invisible.
 It apparently yielded abruptly, because she staggered forward into
 the kitchen, nearly falling. She stared grimly at Ann and looked
 suspiciously behind her.


 ""The children have some new toys,"" Ann improvised hastily. ""Sally is
 so excited over a new dress that she's positively feverish. Let's see
 now—it was sugar that you want, wasn't it?""


 ""I already have it,"" Bob said, handing a filled cup to his mother.
 The boy turned back to the detective set which he had spread over the
 kitchen table.


 ""Excitement isn't good for me,"" Mrs. Burnett said testily. ""I've had a
 lot of troubles in my life. I like peace and quiet.""


 ""Your husband is better?""


 ""Worse. I'm sure I don't know why everything happens to me."" Mrs.
 Burnett edged toward the hall, trying to peer into the front of the
 house. Ann stood squarely in front of the door leading to the hall.
 Defeated, Mrs. Burnett left. A muffled volley of handclapping, mixed
 with a few faint cheers, came from the doorbell-box when she crossed
 the threshold.


 Ann went into the hall to order Les to disconnect the doorbell. She
 nearly collided with him, coming in the other direction.


 ""Where did this come from?"" Les held a small object in the palm of
 his hand, keeping it away from his body. A few drops of something
 unpleasant were dripping from his fingers. The object looked remarkably
 like a human eyeball. It was human-size, complete with pupil, iris and
 rather bloodshot veins.


 ""Hey, that's mine,"" Bob said. ""You know, this is a funny detective kit.
 That was in it. But there aren't instructions on how it works.""


 ""Well, put it away,"" Ann told Bob sharply. ""It's slimy.""


 Les laid the eyeball on the table and walked away. The eyeball rolled
 from the smooth, level table, bounced twice when it hit the floor, then
 rolled along, six inches behind him. He turned and kicked at it. The
 eyeball rolled nimbly out of the path of the kick.


 ""Les, I think we've made poor Mrs. Burnett angry,"" Ann said. ""She's so
 upset over her poor husband's health and she thinks we're insulting
 her.""


 Les didn't hear her. He strode to the detective set, followed at a safe
 distance by the eyeball, and picked up the box.


 ""Hey, watch out!"" Bob cried. A small flashlight fell from the box,
 landed on its side and its bulb flashed on, throwing a pencil of light
 across Les's hands.
Bob retrieved the flashlight and turned it off while Les glanced
 through an instruction booklet, frowning.


 ""This toy is too complicated for a ten-year-old boy,"" Les told his
 wife. ""I don't know why you ordered such a thing."" He tossed the
 booklet into the empty box.


 ""I'm going to return it, if you don't smudge it up,"" she replied. ""Look
 at the marks you made on the instructions."" The black finger-marks
 stood out clearly against the shiny, coated paper.


 Les looked at his hands. ""I didn't do it,"" he said, pressing his clean
 fingertips against the kitchen table.


 Black fingerprints, a full set of them, stood out against the sparkling
 polished table's surface.


 ""I think the Detectolite did it,"" Bob said. ""The instructions say
 you've got to be very careful with it, because its effects last for a
 long time.""


 Les began scrubbing his hands vigorously at the sink. Ann watched him
 silently, until she saw his fingerprints appear on the faucet, the soap
 and the towel. She began to yell at him for making such a mess, when
 Sally floated into the kitchen. The girl was wearing a nightgown.


 ""My God!"" Ann forgot her tongue before the children. ""She got out of
 that dress herself. Where did she get that nightgown?""


 Ann fingered the garment. She didn't recognize it as a nightgown. But
 in cut and fold, it was suspiciously like the dress that had arrived in
 the parcel. Her heart sank.


 She picked up the child, felt the hot forehead, and said: ""Les, I think
 it's the same dress. It must change color or something when it's time
 for a nap. It seems impossible, but—"" She shrugged mutely. ""And I
 think Sally's running a temperature. I'm going to put her to bed.""


 She looked worriedly into the reddened eyes of the small girl, who
 whimpered on the way to the bedroom. Ann carried her up the stairs,
 keeping her balance with difficulty, as Sally threatened to pop upward
 out of her arms.


 The whole family decided that bed might be a good idea, soon after
 dinner. When the lights went out, the house seemed to be nearly normal.
 Les put on a pair of gloves and threw a pillowcase over the eyeball.
 Bob rigged up trestles to warn visitors from the front porch. Ann
 put small wads of cotton into her ears, because she didn't like the
 rhythmic rattle, soft but persistent, that emerged from the hall
 closet where the manky sat. Sally was whining occasionally in her sleep.
When daylight entered her room, Sally's nightgown had turned back into
 the new dress. But the little girl was too sick to get out of bed.
 She wasn't hungry, her nose was running, and she had a dry cough. Les
 called the doctor before going to work.


 The only good thing about the morning for Ann was the fact that the
 manky had quieted down some time in the night. After she got Bob to
 school, she gingerly opened the closet door. The manky was now glowing
 a bright pink and seemed slightly larger. Deep violet lettering stood
 out on its side:


 ""
Today is Wednesday. For obvious reasons, the manky will not operate
 today.
""


 The mailman brought a letter from Hartshorne-Logan. Ann stared stupidly
 at the envelope, until she realized that this wasn't an impossibly
 quick answer to the letter she had written yesterday. It must have
 crossed in the mail her complaint about the non-arrival of the order.
 She tore open the envelope and read:


 ""We regret to inform you that your order cannot be filled until the
 balance you owe us has been reduced. From the attached form, you will
 readily ascertain that the payment of $87.56 will enable you to resume
 the purchasing of merchandise on credit. We shall fill your recent
 order as soon....""


 Ann crumpled the letter and threw it into the imitation fireplace,
 knowing perfectly well that it would need to be retrieved for Les after
 work tonight. She had just decided to call Hartshorne-Logan's complaint
 department when the phone rang.


 ""I'm afraid I must ask you to come down to the school, Mrs. Morris,"" a
 voice said. ""Your son is in trouble. He claims that it's connected with
 something that his parents gave him.""


 ""My son?"" Ann asked incredulously. ""Bob?""


 ""Yes. It's a little gadget that looks like a water pistol. Your son
 insists that he didn't know it would make clothing transparent. He
 claims it was just accident that he tried it out when he was walking
 by the gym during calisthenics. We've had to call upon every family
 in the neighborhood for blankets. Bob has always been a good boy and
 we believe that we can expel him quietly without newspaper publicity
 involving his name, if you'll—""


 ""I'll be right down,"" Ann said. ""I mean I won't be right down. I've got
 a sick baby here. Don't do anything till I telephone my husband. And
 I'm sorry for Bob. I mean I'm sorry for the girls, and for the boys,
 too. I'm sorry for—for everything. Good-by.""
Just as she hung up the telephone, the doorbell rang. It rang with a
 normal buzz, then began to play soft music. Ann opened the door without
 difficulty, to admit Dr. Schwartz.


 ""You aren't going to believe me, Doctor,"" Ann said while he took the
 child's temperature, ""but we can't get that dress off Sally.""


 ""Kids are stubborn sometimes."" Dr. Schwartz whistled softly when he
 looked at the thermometer. ""She's pretty sick. I want a blood count
 before I try to move her. Let me undress her.""


 Sally had been mumbling half-deliriously. She made no effort to resist
 as the doctor picked her up. But when he raised a fold of the dress and
 began to pull it back, she screamed.


 The doctor dropped the dress and looked in perplexity at the point
 where it touched Sally's skin.


 ""It's apparently an allergy to some new kind of material. But I don't
 understand why the dress won't come off. It's not stuck tight.""


 ""Don't bother trying,"" Ann said miserably. ""Just cut it off.""


 Dr. Schwartz pulled scissors from his bag and clipped at a sleeve. When
 he had cut it to the shoulder, he gently began to peel back the edges
 of the cloth. Sally writhed and kicked, then collapsed in a faint. The
 physician smoothed the folds hastily back into place.


 He looked helpless as he said to Ann: ""I don't know quite what to do.
 The flesh starts to hemorrhage when I pull at the cloth. She'd bleed to
 death if I yanked it off. But it's such an extreme allergy that it may
 kill her, if we leave it in contact with the skin.""


 The manky's rattle suddenly began rhythmically from the lower part of
 the house. Ann clutched the side of the chair, trying to keep herself
 under control. A siren wailed somewhere down the street, grew louder
 rapidly, suddenly going silent at the peak of its crescendo.


 Dr. Schwartz glanced outside the window. ""An ambulance. Looks as if
 they're stopping here.""


 ""Oh, no,"" Ann breathed. ""Something's happened to Les.""


 ""It sure will,"" Les said grimly, walking into the bedroom. ""I won't
 have a job if I can't get this stuff off my fingers. Big black
 fingerprints on everything I touch. I can't handle correspondence or
 shake hands with customers. How's the kid? What's the ambulance doing
 out front?""


 ""They're going to the next house down the street,"" the physician said.
 ""Has there been sickness there?""


 Les held up his hands, palms toward the doctor. ""What's wrong with me?
 My fingers look all right. But they leave black marks on everything I
 touch.""


 The doctor looked closely at the fingertips. ""Every human has natural
 oil on the skin. That's how detectives get results with their
 fingerprint powder. But I've never heard of nigrification, in this
 sense. Better not try to commit any crimes until you've seen a skin
 specialist.""
Ann was peering through the window, curious about the ambulance despite
 her own troubles. She saw two attendants carry Mr. Burnett, motionless
 and white, on a stretcher from the house next door into the ambulance.
 A third member of the crew was struggling with a disheveled Mrs.
 Burnett at the door. Shrieks that sounded like ""Murder!"" came sharply
 through the window.


 ""I know those bearers,"" Dr. Schwartz said. He yanked the window open.
 ""Hey, Pete! What's wrong?""


 The front man with the stretcher looked up. ""I don't know. This guy's
 awful sick. I think his wife is nuts.""


 Mrs. Burnett had broken free. She dashed halfway down the sidewalk,
 gesticulating wildly to nobody in particular.


 ""It's murder!"" she screamed. ""Murder again! He's been poisoned! He's
 going to die! It means the electric chair!""


 The orderly grabbed her again. This time he stuffed a handkerchief into
 her mouth to quiet her.


 ""Come back to this house as soon as you deliver him,"" Dr. Schwartz
 shouted to the men. ""We've got a very sick child up here.""


 ""I was afraid this would happen,"" Les said. ""The poor woman already has
 lost three husbands. If this one is sick, it's no wonder she thinks
 that somebody is poisoning him.""


 Bob stuck his head around the bedroom door. His mother stared
 unbelievingly for a moment, then advanced on him threateningly.
 Something in his face restrained her, just as she was about to start
 shaking him.


 ""I got something important to tell you,"" Bob said rapidly, ready to
 duck. ""I snuck out of the principal's office and came home. I got to
 tell you what I did.""


 ""I heard all about what you did,"" Ann said, advancing again. ""And
 you're not going to slip away from me.""


 ""Give me a chance to explain something. Downstairs. So he won't hear,""
 Bob ended in a whisper, nodding toward the doctor.
Ann looked doubtfully at Les, then followed Bob down the stairs. The
 doorbell was monotonously saying in a monotone: ""Don't answer me,
 don't answer me, don't go to the door.""


 ""Why did you do it?"" Ann asked Bob, her anger suddenly slumping into
 weary sadness. ""People will suspect you of being a sex maniac for the
 rest of your life. You can't possibly explain—""


 ""Don't bother about the girls' clothing,"" Bob said, ""because it was
 only an accident. The really important thing is something else I did
 before I left the house.""


 Les, cursing softly, hurried past them on the way to answer the
 knocking. He ignored the doorbell's pleas.


 ""I forgot about it,"" Bob continued, ""when that ray gun accidentally
 went off. Then when they put me in the principal's office, I had time
 to think, and I remembered. I put some white stuff from the detective
 kit into that sugar we lent Mrs. Burnett last night. I just wanted to
 see what would happen. I don't know exactly what effect—""


 ""He put stuff in the sugar?"" A deep, booming voice came from the front
 of the house. Mother and son looked through the hall. A policeman stood
 on the threshold of the front door. ""I heard that! The woman next door
 claims that her husband is poisoned. Young man, I'm going to put you
 under arrest.""


 The policeman stepped over the threshold. A blue flash darted from
 the doorbell box, striking him squarely on the chest. The policeman
 staggered back, sitting down abruptly on the porch. A scent of ozone
 drifted through the house.


 ""Close the door, close the door,"" the doorbell was chanting urgently.


 ""Where's that ambulance?"" Dr. Schwartz yelled from the top of the
 steps. ""The child's getting worse.""

Radio is an absolute necessity in modern

 organization—and particularly in modern

 naval organization. If you could silence all

 radio—silence of that sort would be deadly!

The hurried
rat-a-tat
of knuckles hammered on the cabin door.
 Commander Bob Curtis roused himself from his doze, got up from his
 chair, stretched himself to his full, lanky height and yawned. That
 would be Nelson, his navigating officer. Nelson always knocked that
 way—like a man in an external state of jitters over nothing at all.


 Curtis didn't hurry. It pleased him to let Nelson wait. He moved slowly
 to the door, paused there, and flung a backward glance at the man in
 the cabin with him—Zukor Androka, the elderly Czech scientist, a guest
 of the United States navy, here aboard the cruiser
Comerford
.


 The wizened face of the older man was molded in intent lines of
 concentration, as his bushy gray head bent over his drawing board.
 Curtis got a glimpse of the design on which he was working, and his
 lips relaxed in a faint smile.


 Androka had arrived on board the
Comerford
the day before she sailed
 from Norfolk. With him came a boatload of scientific apparatus and
 equipment, including a number of things that looked like oxygen tanks,
 which were now stored in the forward hold. Androka had watched over
 his treasures with the jealous care of a mother hen, and spent hours
 daily in the room in the superstructure that had been assigned as his
 laboratory.


 Sometimes, Curtis thought old Androka was a bit wacky—a scientist
 whose mind had been turned by the horror that had come to his country
 under the domination of the Nazi
gestapo
. At other times, the man
 seemed a genius. Perhaps that was the answer—a mad genius!


 Curtis opened the door and looked out. Rain whipped against his face
 like a stinging wet lash. Overhead, the sky was a storm-racked mass of
 clouds, broken in one spot by a tiny patch of starlit blue.


 His eyes rested inquiringly on the face of the man who stood before
 him. It
was
Nelson, his shaggy blond brows drawn scowlingly down
 over his pale eyes; his thin face a mass of tense lines; his big hands
 fumbling at the neck of his slicker. Rain was coursing down his white
 cheeks, streaking them with glistening furrows.


 The fellow was a headache to Curtis. He was overfriendly with a
 black-browed bos'n's mate named Joe Bradford—the worst trouble maker
 on board. But there was no question of his ability. He was a good
 navigating officer—dependable, accurate, conscientious. Nevertheless,
 his taut face, restless, searching eyes, and eternally nervous manner
 got Curtis' goat.


 ""Come in, Nelson!"" he said.


 Nelson shouldered his way inside, and stood there in his dripping
 oilskins, blinking his eyes against the yellow light.


 Curtis closed the door and nodded toward the bent form of Zukor
 Androka, with a quizzical grin. ""Old Czech-and-Double-Czech is working
 hard on his latest invention to pull Hitler's teeth and re-establish
 the Czech Republic!""


 Nelson had no answering smile, although there had been a great deal
 of good-natured joking aboard the
Comerford
ever since the navy
 department had sent the scientist on board the cruiser to carry on his
 experiments.


 ""I'm worried, sir!"" Nelson said. ""I'm not sure about my dead reckoning.
 This storm—""


 Curtis threw his arm around Nelson's dripping shoulders. ""Forget it!
 Don't let a little error get you down!""


 ""But this storm, sir!"" Nelson avoided Curtis' friendly eyes and slipped
 out from under his arm. ""It's got me worried. Quartering wind of
 undetermined force, variable and gusty. There's a chop to the sea—as
 if from unestimated currents among the islets. No chance to check by
 observation, and now there is a chance—look at me!""


 He held out his hands. They were shaking as if he had the chills.


 ""You say there is a chance?"" Curtis asked. ""Stars out?""


 ""As if by providence, sir, there's a clear patch. I'm wondering—"" His
 voice trailed off, but his eyes swung toward the gleaming sextant on
 the rack.


 Commander Curtis shrugged good-naturedly and reached for the
 instrument. ""Not that I've lost confidence in you, Nels, but just
 because you asked for it!""
Curtis donned his slicker and went outside, sextant in hand. In a few
 minutes he returned and handed Nelson a sheet of paper with figures
 underlined heavily.


 ""Here's what I make it,"" the commander told his navigating officer.
 ""Bet you're not off appreciably.""


 Nelson stared at the computations with shaking head. Then he mutely
 held up his own.


 Curtis stared, frowned, grabbed his own sheet again. ""Any time I'm
 that far off old Figure-'em Nelson's estimate, I'm checking back,"" he
 declared, frowning at the two papers and hastily rechecking his own
 figures.


 ""Call up to the bridge to stop her,"" he told Nelson. ""We can't afford
 to move in these waters with such a possibility of error!""


 Nelson complied, and the throbbing drive of the engines lessened
 at once. Nelson said: ""I've been wondering, sir, if it wouldn't be
 advisable to try getting a radio cross-bearing. With all these rocks
 and islets—""


 ""Radio?"" repeated the little Czech, thrusting his face between the
 other two, in his independent fashion that ignored ship's discipline.
 ""You're using your radio?"" He broke into a knowing chuckle, his keen
 old eyes twinkling behind their thick lenses. ""Go ahead and try it. See
 how much you can get! It will be no more than Hitler can get when Zukor
 Androka decrees silence over the German airways! Try it! Try it, I say!""


 Bob Curtis stared at him, as if questioning his sanity. Then he
 hastened to the radio room, with Nelson at his heels, and the Czech
 trotting along behind.


 The door burst open as they neared it. A frightened operator came out,
 still wearing his earphones, and stood staring upward incredulously at
 the aërial.


 ""Get us a radio cross-bearing for location at once,"" Curtis said
 sharply, for the operator seemed in a daze.


 ""Bearing, sir?"" The man brought his eyes down with difficulty, as if
 still dissatisfied. ""I'm sorry, sir, but the outfit's dead. Went out on
 me about five minutes ago. I was taking the weather report when the set
 conked. I was trying to see if something's wrong.""


 The Czech inventor giggled. Curtis gave him another curious look and
 thrust himself into the radio room.


 ""Try again!"" he told the operator. ""See what you can get!""


 The radio man leaped to his seat and tried frantically. Again and
 again, he sent off a request for a cross-bearing from shore stations
 that had recently been established to insure safety to naval vessels,
 but there was no answer on any of the bands—not even the blare of a
 high-powered commercial program in the higher reach, nor the chatter of
 ships or amateurs on the shorter.


 ""Dead!"" Androka muttered, with a bitter laugh. ""Yet not dead,
 gentlemen! The set is uninjured. The waves are what have been upset. I
 have shattered them around your ship, just as I can eventually shatter
 them all over Central Europe! For the next two hours, no radio messages
 can enter or leave my zone of radio silence—of refracted radio waves,
 set up by my little station on one of the neighboring islets!""
There was a long pause, while commander and navigator stared at him.
 Curtis was the first to speak.


 ""Your secrecy might well cost the United States navy one of its best
 light cruisers—and us our lives!"" he said angrily. ""We need that check
 by radio at once! If you're not talking nonsense, call off your dogs
 till we learn just where we are!""


 Androka held out his palms helplessly. ""I can do nothing. I have given
 orders to my assistant that he must keep two hours of radio silence! I
 can get no message to him, for our radio is dead!""


 As if to mock him, the ship's radio began to answer:


 ""Station 297 calling U. S. Cruiser
Comerford
. Station 297 calling U.
 S. Cruiser
Comerford
—""


 ""U. S. Cruiser
Comerford
calling Station 297!"" the operator intoned,
 winking at the two officers over Androka's discomfiture, and asked for
 the bearings.


 The answer came back: ""Bearings north east by a quarter east, U. S.
 Cruiser
Comerford
!""


 Curtis sighed with relief. He saw that Nelson was staring fiercely
 at the radio operator, as the man went on calling: ""U. S. Cruiser
Comerford
calling Station 364. U. S. Cruiser
Comerford
calling
 Station 364—""


 Then the instrument rasped again: ""Station 364 calling U. S. Cruiser
Comerford
. Bearings north west by three west. Bearings north west by
 three west, U. S. Cruiser
Comerford
from Cay 364.""


 Commander and navigator had both scribbled verifications of the
 numbers. Ignoring the gibbering Androka, who was wailing his
 disappointment that messages had penetrated his veil of silence, they
 raced for the chart room.
Quickly the parallels stepped off the bearing from the designated
 points. Light intersecting lines proclaimed a check on their position.


 Curtis frowned and shook his head. Slowly he forced a reluctant grin as
 he stuck out his hand.


 ""Shake, Nels,"" he said. ""It's my turn to eat crow. You and the radio
 must be right. Continue as you were!""


 ""I'm relieved, sir, just the same,"" Nelson admitted, ""to have the radio
 bearings. We'd have piled up sure if you'd been right.""


 They went on through the night. The starlit gap in the clouds had
 closed. The sky was again a blanket of darkness pouring sheets of rain
 at them.


 Nelson went back to the bridge, and Androka returned to the commander's
 cabin. Curtis lingered in the wireless room with the radio operator.


 ""It's a funny thing,"" the latter said, still dialing and grousing, ""how
 I got that cross-bearing through and can't get another squeak out of
 her. I'm wondering if that old goat really
has
done something to the
 ether. The set seems O. K.""


 He lingered over the apparatus, checking and rechecking. Tubes lighted;
 wires were alive to the touch and set him to shaking his head at the
 tingle they sent through his inquiring fingers.


 Curtis left him at it, and went to rejoin Androka in the cabin. He
 found the little inventor pacing up and down, shaking his fists in the
 air; pausing every now and then to run his bony fingers through his
 tangled mop of gray hair, or to claw nervously at his beard.


 ""You have seen a miracle, commander!"" he shouted at Curtis. ""
My
miracle! My invention has shattered the ether waves hereabouts
 hopelessly.""


 ""Seems to me,"" Curtis said dryly, ""this invention can harm your friends
 as much as your enemies.""


 The scientist drew himself up to his full height—which was only a
 little over five feet. His voice grew shrill. ""Wait! Just wait! There
 are other inventions to supplement this one. Put them together, and
 they will defeat the Nazi hordes which have ravaged my country!""


 Curtis was a little shocked by the hatred that gleamed in Androka's
 eyes, under their bushy brows. There was something of the wild animal
 in the man's expression, as his lips drew back from his yellowed teeth.


 ""Those tanks you have below,"" Curtis said, ""have they some connection
 with this radio silence?""


 A far-away look came into Androka's eyes. He did not seem to hear
 the question. He lowered his voice: ""My daughter is still in Prague.
 So are my sister and her husband, and
their
two daughters. If the
gestapo
knew what I am doing, all of them would be better dead. You
 understand—better dead?""


 Curtis said: ""I understand.""


 ""And if the Nazi agents in America knew of the islet from which my zone
 of silence is projected—"" Androka paused, his head tilted to one side,
 as if he were listening to something—
On deck, there was shouting and commotion. Curtis rushed out, pulling
 on his slicker as he went. The shout from the watch forward had been
 picked up, and was being relayed all over the ship. The words struck on
 Curtis' ears with a note of impending tragedy.


 ""Breakers ahead!""


 He was beside Navigating Officer Nelson on the bridge, and saw the
 helmsman climbing the rapidly spinning wheel like a monkey as he put it
 hard aport.


 Then the ship struck. Everything movable shot ahead until it brought up
 at the end of a swing or smacked against something solid.


 Curtis felt Nelson's hand grip his shoulder, as he put his lips close
 to his ear and shouted: ""You must have been right, sir, and the radio
 bearings and my reckoning wrong. We've hit that reef a terrific smack.
 I'm afraid we're gored!""


 ""Get out the collision mat!"" Curtis ordered. ""We ought to be able to
 keep her up!""


 And then he became aware of a deadly stillness. A vast wall of silence
 enveloped the entire cruiser. Looking over the side, he could no longer
 see the waves that a few minutes before had beaten savagely against the
 ship.


 The
Comerford
was shrouded in a huge pall of yellowish-gray mist, and
 more of it was coming up from below—from ventilators and hatchways and
 skylights—as if the whole ship were flooded with some evil vapor.


 Somehow, Curtis' mind flashed to the stories he'd heard of the forts of
 the Maginot Line, and of other forts in Holland and Belgium that had
 fallen before the early Nazi blitzkrieg, when their defenders found
 themselves struck numb and helpless by a gas that had been flooded into
 the inner compartments of their strongholds.


 There were those who said it was the work of sappers who had tunneled
 under the foundations, while others laid the induction of the gas to
 Fifth Column traitors. There were a hundred more or less plausible
 explanations—


 The vapor clouds that enveloped the
Comerford
were becoming thicker.
 All about the deck lay the forms of unconscious seamen, suddenly
 stricken helpless. And then Curtis saw other forms flitting about the
 deck—forms that looked like creatures from another world, but he
 recognized them for what they were—men wearing gas masks.


 Nelson was nowhere in sight. The steersman lay in a limp heap beside
 the swinging wheel. Then a gas-masked figure appeared through the
 shroud of mist and steadied it, so that the cruiser would not be
 completely at the mercy of the wind and the waves.


 Curtis heard the anchor let down, as if by invisible hands, the chain
 screaming and flailing its clanking way through the hawse hole. Then he
 was completely walled in by the yellowish-gray mist. He felt his senses
 swimming.


 Voices droned all around him in mumbling confusion—guttural voices
 that ebbed and flowed in a tide of excited talk. He caught a word of
 English now and then, mixed in with a flood of Teuton phonetics.


 Two words, in particular, registered clearly on his mind. One was
 ""
Carethusia
""; the other was ""convoy."" But gradually his eardrums
 began to throb, as if someone were pounding on them from the inside. He
 couldn't get his breath; a cloud seemed to be mounting within him until
 it swept over his brain—


 He felt something strike the side of his head, and realized that he had
 fallen in a heap on the bridge. And after that, he wasn't conscious of
 anything—
The rain had abated to a foggy drizzle. The wash of the surf swung the
Comerford
in a lazy, rolling motion, as she lay with her bow nosing
 into the sandbar at the entrance of the inlet.


 From her bridge, Navigating Officer Nelson watched the gas-masked
 figures moving about the decks, descending companionways—like goblins
 from an ancient fairy tale or a modern horror story. Nelson looked like
 a goblin himself, with his face covered by a respirator. At his side,
 stood his fellow conspirator Bos'n's Mate Joe Bradford, also wearing a
 gas mask.


 Nelson spoke in a low tone, his lips close to Bradford's ear. ""It
 worked, Joe!""


 ""Yeah!"" Bradford agreed. ""It worked—fine!""


 The limp bodies of the
Comerford's
crew were being carried to the
 lowered accommodation ladder and transferred into waiting lifeboats.


 Nelson swore under his breath. ""Reckon it'll take a couple of hours
 before the ship's rid of that damn gas!""


 Bradford shook his head in disagreement. ""The old geezer claims he's
 got a neutralizing chemical in one of them tanks of his that'll clear
 everything up inside half an hour.""


 ""I'd rather get along without Androka, if we could!"" Nelson muttered.
 ""He's nothing but a crackpot!""


 ""It was a crackpot who invented the gas we used to break up the
 Maginot Line,"" Bradford reminded him. ""It saved a lot of lives for the
Fuehrer
—lives that'd have been lost if the forts had to be taken by
 our storm troopers!""


 Nelson grunted and turned away. A short, thick-set figure in the
 uniform of a German naval commander had ascended the accommodation
 ladder and was mounting to the bridge. He, too, was equipped with a
 respirator.


 He came up to Nelson, saluted, and held out his hand, introducing
 himself as Herr Kommander Brandt. He began to speak in German, but
 Nelson stopped him.


 ""I don't speak any German,"" he explained. ""I was born and educated in
 the United States—of German parents, who had been ruined in the First
 World War. My mother committed suicide when she learned that we were
 penniless. My father—"" He paused and cleared his throat.


 ""
Ja!
Your father?"" the German officer prompted, dropping into
 accented English. ""Your father?""


 ""My father dedicated me to a career of revenge—to wipe out his
 wrongs,"" Nelson continued. ""If America hadn't gone into the First
 World War, he wouldn't have lost his business; my mother would still
 be living. When he joined the Nazi party, the way became clear to use
 me—to educate me in a military prep school, then send me to Annapolis,
 for a career in the United States navy—and no one suspected me. No
 one—""


 ""Sometimes,"" Bradford put in, ""I think Curtis suspected you.""


 ""Maybe Curtis'll find out his suspicions were justified,"" Nelson said
 bitterly. ""But it won't do Curtis any good—a commander who's lost
 his ship."" He turned to Brandt. ""You have plenty of men to work the
Comerford
?""


 Brandt nodded his square head. ""We have a full crew—two hundred
 men—officers, seamen, mechanics, radio men, technical experts, all
 German naval reservists living in the United States, who've been sent
 here secretly, a few at a time, during the past six weeks!""
The three—Brandt, Nelson and Bradford—stood on the bridge and talked,
 while the efficient stretcher-bearers worked industriously to remove
 the limp bodies of the
Comerford's
unconscious crew and row them
 ashore.


 And when that task was completed, lifeboats began to come alongside
 with strange-looking radio equipment, and more gas tanks like those
 Androka had brought aboard the
Comerford
with him, and dynamos and
 batteries that looked like something out of a scientific nightmare.


 And bustling all over the place, barking excited commands in German,
 pushing and pulling and pointing to emphasize his directions, was the
 strange figure of Professor Zukor Androka!


 ""The professor's in his glory!"" Nelson remarked to Kommander Brandt.


 ""Funny thing about him,"" Bradford put in, ""is that his inventions work.
 That zone of silence cut us off completely.""


 Kommander Brandt nodded. ""Goodt! But you got your message giving your
 bearings—the wrong ones?""


 ""Yes,"" Nelson said. ""That came through all right. And won't Curtis have
 a time explaining it!""


 ""Hereafter,"" Brandt said solemnly, ""the zone of silence vill be
 projected from the
Comerford
; and ve have another invention of
 Androka's vich vill be even more useful vhen ve come to cut the
Carethusia
out of her convoy.""


 ""The
Carethusia
?"" Nelson asked, in a puzzled tone.


 Brandt said: ""She's a freighter in a convoy out of St. Johns—twelve
 thousand tons. The orders are to take her; not sink her.""


 ""What's the idea?""


 ""Her cargo,"" Brandt explained. ""It iss more precious than rubies. It
 includes a large shipment of boarts.""


 ""Boarts?"" Nelson repeated. ""What are they?""


 ""Boarts,"" Brandt told him, ""are industrial diamonds—black,
 imperfectly crystallized stones, but far more valuable to us than
 flawless diamonds from Tiffany's on Fift' Avenue. They are needed for
 making machine tools. They come from northern Brazil—and our supply is
 low.""


 ""I should think we could get a shipment of these boarts direct from
 Brazil—through the blockade,"" Nelson said, ""without taking the risk of
 capturing a United States navy cruiser.""


 ""There are other things Germany needs desperately on board the
Carethusia
,"" Brandt explained. ""Vanadium and nickel and hundreds of
 barrels of lard oil for machine-tool lubrication. Our agents have been
 watching the convoys closely for weeks for just such a cargo as the
Carethusia
is taking over.""


 ""Can we trust Androka?"" Nelson asked, with a sudden note of suspicion
 in his voice.


 ""Yes,"" Brandt assured him. ""Of all men—we can trust Androka!""


 ""But he's a Czech,"" Nelson argued.


 ""The
gestapo
takes care of Czechs and Poles and Frenchmen and other
 foreigners whom it chooses as its agents,"" Brandt pointed out. ""Androka
 has a daughter and other relations in Prague. He knows that if anything
 misfires, if there is the slightest suspicion of treachery on his part,
 his daughter and the others will suffer. Androka's loyalty is assured!""


 Nelson turned to watch the forward fighting top of the
Comerford
.
 The masked German seamen were installing some sort of apparatus
 up there—a strange-looking object that looked something like an
 old-fashioned trench mortar, and which connected with cables to the
 room that served as Androka's laboratory and workshop.


 Another crew was installing radio apparatus in the mizzentop turret.


 Descending a companionway to see what was going on below, Nelson found
 that portholes were being opened, and men were spraying chemical around
 to rid the below-decks atmosphere of the lethal gas that had overcome
 the
Comerford's
American crew.


 Returning to the bridge, he found that the tide in the inlet had risen
 considerably, and that the cruiser was riding more easily at her anchor.


 Then, at Brandt's orders, the anchor was hauled in, and lifeboats and a
 motor launch were used as tugs to work the vessel entirely free of the
 sand bar. This was accomplished without difficulty.


 Brandt came over to where Nelson was standing on the bridge and held
 out his hand.


 ""Congratulations, Herr Kommander Nelson!"" he said. ""Ve have stolen one
 of the United States navy's newest and fastest cruisers!"" He made a
 gesture as if raising a beer stein to drink a toast. ""
Prosit!
"" he
 added.


 ""
Prosit!
"" Nelson repeated, and the two grinned at each other.
Stars were twinkling in a patch of black-blue sky, and broken mountains
 of gray cloud were skudding before the east wind. Commander Bob Curtis
 found himself lying in wet sand, on a beach, somewhere, with the
 rain—now a light, driving mist—beating on his face. He was chilled;
 his limbs were stiff and numb. His nose and throat felt parched inside,
 as if a wave of searing heat had scorched them.


 According to his last calculations, the
Comerford
had been cruising
 off the Maine coast. This probably was one of the islets of that
 region, or it might be the mainland.


 It was hard work getting to his feet, and when he did manage to stand,
 he could only plant his heels in the sand and sway to and fro for fully
 a minute, like a child learning to walk.


 All around him in the nearly total darkness, he could make out the dim
 forms of men sprawled on the beach; and of other men moving about,
 exploring. He heard the murmur of voices and saw the glow of lighted
 cigarettes.


 A man with a flashlight was approaching him. Its white glare shone for
 a moment in Curtis' face, and the familiar voice of Ensign Jack Dillon
 spoke: ""Commander Curtis! Are you O. K., sir?""


 ""I think so!"" Curtis' heart warmed at the eager expression in Dillon's
 face; at the heartfelt concern in his friendly brown eyes. The young
 ensign was red-headed, impetuous, thoroughly genuine in his emotions.
 ""How about yourself, Jack?"" Curtis added.


 ""A bit of a headache from the gas, but that's all. Any orders, sir?""


 Curtis thought for a moment. ""Muster the crew, as best you can. We'll
 try to make a roll call. Is there any sign of the ship?""


 There was a solemn note in Dillon's voice. ""No, sir. She's been worked
 off the sandbar and put to sea!""


 The words struck Curtis with the numbing shock of a blow on some nerve
 center. For the first time, he realized fully the tragedy that had
 swept down on him. He had lost his ship—one of the United States
 navy's fastest and newest small light cruisers—under circumstances
 which smelled strongly of treachery and sabotage.


 As he thought back, he realized that he
might
have prevented the
 loss, if he had been more alert, more suspicious. For it was clear to
 him now that the
Comerford
had been deliberately steered to this
 place; that the men who had seized her had been waiting here for that
 very purpose.


 The pieces of the picture fitted together like a jigsaw
 puzzle—Androka's zone of silence; the bearings given by radio;
 Navigating Officer Nelson's queer conduct. They were all part of a
 carefully laid plan!


 All the suspicious circumstances surrounding Nelson came flooding into
 Curtis' mind. He had never liked the man; never trusted him. Nelson
 always acted as if he had some secret, something to hide.


 Curtis recalled that Nelson and Androka had long conversations
 together—conversations which they would end abruptly when anyone else
 came within earshot. And Nelson had always been chummy with the worst
 trouble maker in the crew—Bos'n's Mate Bradford.


 Curtis went around, finding the officers, issuing orders. There were
 still some unconscious men to be revived. In a sheltered cove among
 the rocks, an exploring group had found enough dry driftwood to make a
 fire—


 In another hour, the skies had cleared, and white moonlight flooded
 the scene with a ghostly radiance. The men of the
Comerford
had
 all regained consciousness and were drying out in front of the big
 driftwood bonfires in the cove.


 Curtis ordered a beacon kept burning on a high promontory. Then he got
 the men lined up, according to their respective classifications, for a
 check-up on the missing.


 When this was completed, it was found that the
Comerford's
entire
 complement of two hundred and twenty men were present—except
 Navigating Officer Nelson, and Bos'n's Mate Bradford! And Zukor Androka
 was also missing!


 With the coming of dawn, a little exploration revealed that the
Comerford's
crew was marooned on an islet, about a square mile in
 area; that they had been put ashore without food or extra clothing or
 equipment of any kind, and that no boats had been left for them.


 One searching party reported finding the remains of what had been a
 radio station on a high promontory on the north shore of the islet.
 Another had found the remains of tents and log cabins, recently
 demolished, in a small, timbered hollow—a well-hidden spot invisible
 from the air, unless one were flying very low; a place where two
 hundred or more men could have camped.


 There was a good water supply—a small creek fed by springs—but
 nothing in the way of food. Evidently food was a precious commodity
 which the recent inhabitants of the islet couldn't afford to leave
 behind.


 Curtis was studying the wreckage of the wireless station, wondering
 if this might have been the source of Androka's zone of silence, when
 Ensign Jack Dillon came up to him.


 ""There's a coast-guard cutter heading for the island, sir,"" he
 announced.

Harvey and Joe were the slickest con-men ever

 to gyp a space-lane sucker. Or so they thought!

 Angus Johnson knew differently. He charged them

 five buckos for a glass of water—and got it!

Characteristically, Harvey Ellsworth tried to maintain his dignity,
 though his parched tongue was almost hanging out. But Joe Mallon, with
 no dignity to maintain, lurched across the rubbish-strewn patch of land
 that had been termed a spaceport. When Harvey staggered pontifically
 into the battered metalloy saloon—the only one on Planetoid 42—his
 tall, gangling partner was already stumbling out, mouthing something
 incoherent. They met in the doorway, violently.


 ""We're delirious!"" Joe cried. ""It's a mirage!""


 ""What is?"" asked Harvey through a mouthful of cotton.


 Joe reeled aside, and Harvey saw what had upset his partner. He stared,
 speechless for once.


 In their hectic voyages from planet to planet, the pair of panacea
 purveyors had encountered the usual strange life-forms. But never had
 they seen anything like the amazing creature in that colonial saloon.


 Paying no attention to them, it was carrying a case of liquor in two
 hands, six siphons in two others, and a broom and dustpan in the
 remaining pair. The bartender, a big man resembling the plumpish
 Harvey in build, was leaning negligently on the counter, ordering this
 impossible being to fill the partly-emptied bottles, squeeze fruit
 juice and sweep the floor, all of which the native did simultaneously.


 ""Nonsense,"" Harvey croaked uncertainly. ""We have seen enough queer
 things to know there are always more.""


 He led the way inside. Through thirst-cracked lips he rasped:
 ""Water—quick!""


 Without a word, the bartender reached under the counter, brought out
 two glasses of water. The interplanetary con-men drank noisily, asked
 for more, until they had drunk eight glasses. Meanwhile, the bartender
 had taken out eight jiggers and filled them with whiskey.


 Harvey and Joe were breathing hard from having gulped the water so
 fast, but they were beginning to revive. They noticed the bartender's
 impersonal eyes studying them shrewdly.


 ""Strangers, eh?"" he asked at last.


 ""Solar salesmen, my colonial friend,"" Harvey answered in his usual
 lush manner. ""We purvey that renowned Martian remedy,
La-anago
 Yergis
, the formula for which was recently discovered by ourselves in
 the ancient ruined city of La-anago. Medical science is unanimous in
 proclaiming this magic medicine the sole panacea in the entire history
 of therapeutics.""


 ""Yeah?"" said the bartender disinterestedly, polishing the chaser
 glasses without washing them. ""Where you heading?""


 ""Out of Mars for Ganymede. Our condenser broke down, and we've gone
 without water for five ghastly days.""


 ""Got a mechanic around this dumping ground you call a port?"" Joe asked.


 ""We did. He came near starving and moved on to Titan. Ships don't land
 here unless they're in trouble.""


 ""Then where's the water lead-in? We'll fill up and push off.""


 ""Mayor takes care of that,"" replied the saloon owner. ""If you gents're
 finished at the bar, your drinks'll be forty buckos.""


 Harvey grinned puzzledly. ""We didn't take any whiskey.""


 ""Might as well. Water's five buckos a glass. Liquor's free with every
 chaser.""


 Harvey's eyes bulged. Joe gulped. ""That—that's robbery!"" the lanky man
 managed to get out in a thin quaver.


 The barkeeper shrugged. ""When there ain't many customers, you gotta
 make more on each one. Besides—""


 ""Besides nothing!"" Joe roared, finding his voice again. ""You dirty
 crook—robbing poor spacemen! You—""
""You dirty crook!"" Joe roared. ""Robbing honest spacemen!""
Harvey nudged him warningly. ""Easy, my boy, easy."" He turned to the
 bartender apologetically. ""Don't mind my friend. His adrenal glands are
 sometimes overactive. You were going to say—?""
The round face of the barkeeper had assumed an aggrieved expression.


 ""Folks are always thinkin' the other feller's out to do 'em,"" he said,
 shaking his head. ""Lemme explain about the water here. It's bitter
 as some kinds of sin before it's purified. Have to bring it in with
 buckets and make it sweet. That takes time and labor. Waddya think—I
 was chargin' feller critters for water just out of devilment? I charge
 because I gotta.""


 ""Friend,"" said Harvey, taking out a wallet and counting off eight
 five-bucko bills, ""here is your money. What's fair is fair, and you
 have put a different complexion on what seemed at first to be an
 unconscionable interjection of a middleman between Nature and man's
 thirst.""


 The saloon man removed his dirty apron and came around the bar.


 ""If that's an apology, I accept it. Now the mayor'll discuss filling
 your tanks. That's me. I'm also justice of the peace, official
 recorder, fire chief....""


 ""And chief of police, no doubt,"" said Harvey jocosely.


 ""Nope. That's my son, Jed. Angus Johnson's my name. Folks here just
 call me Chief. I run this town, and run it right. How much water will
 you need?""


 Joe estimated quickly. ""About seventy-five liters, if we go on half
 rations,"" he answered. He waited apprehensively.


 ""Let's say ten buckos a liter,"" the mayor said. ""On account of the
 quantity, I'm able to quote a bargain price. Shucks, boys, it hurts me
 more to charge for water than it does for you to pay. I just got to,
 that's all.""


 The mayor gestured to the native, who shuffled out to the tanks with
 them. The planetoid man worked the pump while the mayor intently
 watched the crude level-gauge, crying ""Stop!"" when it registered the
 proper amount. Then Johnson rubbed his thumb on his index finger and
 wetted his lips expectantly.


 Harvey bravely counted off the bills. He asked: ""But what are we to
 do about replenishing our battery fluid? Ten buckos a liter would be
 preposterous. We simply can't afford it.""


 Johnson's response almost floored them. ""Who said anything about
 charging you for battery water? You can have all you want for nothing.
 It's just the purified stuff that comes so high.""


 After giving them directions that would take them to the free-water
 pool, the ponderous factotum of Planetoid 42 shook hands and headed
 back to the saloon. His six-armed assistant followed him inside.


 ""Now do you see, my hot-tempered colleague?"" said Harvey as he and Joe
 picked up buckets that hung on the tank. ""Johnson, as I saw instantly,
 is the victim of a difficult environment, and must charge accordingly.""


 ""Just the same,"" Joe griped, ""paying for water isn't something you can
 get used to in ten minutes.""


 In the fragile forest, they soon came across a stream that sprang from
 the igneous soil and splashed into the small pond whose contents,
 according to the mayor, was theirs for the asking. They filled their
 buckets and hauled them to the ship, then returned for more.
It was on the sixth trip that Joe caught a glimpse of Jupiter-shine on
 a bright surface off to the left. The figure, 750, with the bucko sign
 in front of it, was still doing acrobatics inside his skull and keeping
 a faint suspicion alive in him. So he called Harvey and they went to
 investigate.


 Among the skimpy ground-crawling vines, they saw a long slender mound
 that was unmistakably a buried pipe.


 ""What's this doing here?"" Harvey asked, puzzled. ""I thought Johnson had
 to transport water in pails.""


 ""Wonder where it leads to,"" Joe said uneasily.


 ""It leads
to
the saloon,"" said Harvey, his eyes rapidly tracing the
 pipe back toward the spaceport. ""What I am concerned with is where it
 leads
from
.""


 Five minutes later, panting heavily from the unaccustomed exertion of
 scrambling through the tangle of planetorial undergrowth, they burst
 into the open—before a clear, sparkling pool.


 Mutely, Harvey pointed out a pipe-end jutting under the water.


 ""I am growing suspicious,"" he said in a rigidly controlled voice.


 But Joe was already on his knees, scooping up a handful of water and
 tasting it.


 ""Sweet!"" he snarled.


 They rushed back to the first pool, where Joe again tasted a sample.
 His mouth went wry. ""Bitter! He uses only one pool, the sweet one! The
 only thing that needs purifying around here is that blasted mayor's
 conscience.""


 ""The asteroidal Poobah has tricked us with a slick come-on,"" said
 Harvey slowly. His eyes grew cold. ""Joseph, the good-natured artist in
 me has become a hard and merciless avenger. I shall not rest until we
 have had the best of this colonial con-man! Watch your cues from this
 point hence.""


 Fists clenched, the two returned to the saloon. But at the door they
 stopped and their fists unclenched.


 ""Thought you gents were leaving,"" the mayor called out, seeing them
 frozen in the doorway. ""Glad you didn't. Now you can meet my son, Jed.
 Him and me are the whole Earthman population of Johnson City.""


 ""You don't need any more,"" said Harvey, dismayed.


 Johnson's eight-foot son, topped by a massive roof of sun-bleached hair
 and held up by a foundation that seemed immovable, had obviously been
 born and raised in low gravity. For any decent-sized world would have
 kept him down near the general dimensions of a man.


 He held out an acre of palm. Harvey studied it worriedly, put his own
 hand somewhere on it, swallowed as it closed, then breathed again when
 his fingers were released in five units instead of a single compressed
 one.


 ""Pleased to meet you,"" piped a voice that had never known a dense
 atmosphere.


 The pursuit of vengeance, Harvey realized, had taken a quick and
 unpleasant turn. Something shrewd was called for....


 ""Joseph!"" he exclaimed, looking at his partner in alarm. ""Don't you
 feel well?""


 Even before the others could turn to him, Joe's practiced eyes were
 gently crossing. He sagged against the door frame, all his features
 drooping like a bloodhound's.


 ""Bring him in here!"" Johnson cried. ""I mean, get him away! He's coming
 down with asteroid fever!""


 ""Of course,"" replied Harvey calmly. ""Any fool knows the first symptoms
 of the disease that once scourged the universe.""


 ""What do you mean,
once
?"" demanded Johnson. ""I come down with it
 every year, and I ain't hankering to have it in an off-season. Get him
 out of here!""


 ""In good time. He can't be moved immediately.""


 ""Then he'll be here for months!""


 Harvey helped Joe to the counter and lifted him up on it. The mayor and
 his gigantic offspring were cowering across the room, trying to breathe
 in tiny, uncontaminating gasps.


 ""You'll find everything you want in the back room,"" Johnson said
 frantically, ""sulfopyridine, mustard plasters, rubs, inhalers, suction
 cups—""


 ""Relics of the past,"" Harvey stated. ""One medication is all modern man
 requires to combat the dread menace, asteroid fever.""


 ""What's that?"" asked the mayor without conviction.


 Instead of replying, Harvey hurried outside to the ungainly second-hand
 rocket ship in the center of the shabby spaceport. He returned within a
 few minutes, carrying a bottle.
Joe was still stretched out on the bar, panting, his eyes slowly
 crossing and uncrossing. Harvey lifted the patient's head tenderly,
 put the bottle to his lips and tilted it until he was forced to drink.
 When Joe tried to pull away, Harvey was inexorable. He made his partner
 drink until most of the liquid was gone. Then he stepped back and
 waited for the inevitable result.


 Joe's performance was better than ever. He lay supine for several
 moments, his face twisted into an expression that seemed doomed
 to perpetual wryness. Slowly, however, he sat up and his features
 straightened out.


 ""Are—are you all right?"" asked the mayor anxiously.


 ""Much better,"" said Joe in a weak voice.


 ""Maybe you need another dose,"" Harvey suggested.


 Joe recoiled. ""I'm fine now!"" he cried, and sprang off the bar to prove
 it.


 Astonished, Johnson and his son drew closer. They searched Joe's face,
 and then the mayor timidly felt his pulse.


 ""Well, I'll be hanged!"" Johnson ejaculated.


 ""
La-anago Yergis
never fails, my friend,"" Harvey explained. ""By
 actual test, it conquers asteroid fever in from four to twenty-three
 minutes, depending on the severity of the attack. Luckily, we caught
 this one before it grew formidable.""


 The mayor's eyes became clouded mirrors of an inward conflict. ""If you
 don't charge too much,"" he said warily, ""I might think of buying some.""


 ""We do not sell this unbelievable remedy,"" Harvey replied with dignity.
 ""It sells itself.""


 ""'Course, I'd expect a considerable reduction if I bought a whole
 case,"" said Johnson.


 ""That would be the smallest investment you could make, compared with
 the vast loss of time and strength the fever involves.""


 ""How much?"" asked the mayor unhappily.


 ""For you, since you have taken us in so hospitably, a mere five hundred
 buckos.""


 Johnson did not actually stagger back, but he gave the impression of
 doing so. ""F-four hundred,"" he offered.


 ""Not a red cent less than four seventy-five,"" Harvey said flatly.


 ""Make it four fifty,"" quavered Johnson.


 ""I dislike haggling,"" said Harvey.


 The final price, however, was four hundred and sixty-nine buckos and
 fifty redsents. Magnanimously, Harvey added: ""And we will include,
gratis
, an elegant bottle-opener, a superb product of Mercurian
 handicraftsmanship.""


 Johnson stabbed out a warning finger. ""No tricks now. I want a taste of
 that stuff. You're not switching some worthless junk on me.""


 Harvey took a glass from the bar and poured him a generous sample. The
 mayor sniffed it, grimaced, then threw it down his gullet. The ensuing
 minute saw a grim battle between a man and his stomach, a battle which
 the man gradually won.


 ""There ain't no words for that taste,"" he gulped when it was safe to
 talk again.


 ""Medicine,"" Harvey propounded, ""should taste like medicine."" To Joe he
 said: ""Come, my esteemed colleague. We must perform the sacred task to
 which we have dedicated ourselves.""


 With Joe stumbling along behind, he left the saloon, crossed the
 clearing and entered the ship. As soon as they were inside, Joe dropped
 his murderous silence and cried:


 ""What kind of a dirty trick was that, giving me poison instead of that
 snake oil?""


 ""That was not poison,"" Harvey contradicted quietly. ""It was
La-anago
 Yergis
extract, plus.""


 ""Plus what—arsenic?""


 ""Now, Joseph! Consider my quandary when I came back here to manufacture
 our specific for all known ailments, with the intention of selling
 yonder asteroidal tin-horn a bill of medical goods—an entire case,
 mind you. Was I to mix the extract with the water for which we had been
 swindled to the tune of ten buckos a liter? Where would our profit have
 been, then? No; I had to use the bitter free water, of course.""


 ""But why use it on me?"" Joe demanded furiously.


 Harvey looked reprovingly at his gangling partner. ""Did Johnson ask to
 taste it, or did he not? One must look ahead, Joseph. I had to produce
 the same
medicine
that we will now manufacture. Thus, you were a
 guinea pig for a splendid cause.""


 ""Okay, okay,"" Joe said. ""But you shoulda charged him more.""


 ""Joseph, I promise you that we shall get back every redsent of which
 that swindler cheated us, besides whatever other funds or valuables he
 possesses. We could not be content with less.""


 ""Well, we're starting all right,"" admitted Joe. ""How about that thing
 with six arms? He looks like a valuable. Can't we grab him off?""


 Harvey stopped filling bottles and looked up pensively.


 ""I have every hope of luring away the profitable monstrosity.
 Apparently you have also surmised the fortune we could make with him.
 At first I purpose to exhibit him on our interplanetary tours with our
 streamlined panacea; he would be a spectacular attraction for bucolic
 suckers. Later, a brief period of demonstrating his abilities on the
 audio-visiphone. Then our triumph—we shall sell him at a stupendous
 figure to the zoo!""
Joe was still dazed by that monetary vista when he and Harvey carried
 the case of medicine to the saloon. The mayor had already cleared a
 place of honor in the cluttered back room, where he told them to put it
 down carefully. Then he took the elaborate bottle-opener Harvey gave
 him, reverently uncorked a bottle and sampled it. It must have been at
 least as good as the first; he gagged.


 ""That's the stuff, all right,"" he said, swallowing hard. He counted
 out the money into Harvey's hand, at a moderate rate that precariously
 balanced between his pleasure at getting the fever remedy and his pain
 at paying for it. Then he glanced out to see the position of Jupiter,
 and asked: ""You gents eaten yet? The restaurant's open now.""


 Harvey and Joe looked at each other. They hadn't been thinking about
 food at all, but suddenly they realized that they were hungry.


 ""It's only water we were short of,"" Harvey said apprehensively. ""We've
 got rations back at the ship.""


 ""
H-mph!
"" the mayor grunted. ""Powdered concentrates. Compressed pap.
 Suit yourselves. We treat our stomachs better here. And you're welcome
 to our hospitality.""


 ""Your hospitality,"" said Harvey, ""depends on the prices you charge.""


 ""Well, if that's what's worrying you, you can stop worrying,"" answered
 the mayor promptly. ""What's more, the kind of dinner I serve here you
 can't get anywhere else for any price.""


 Swiftly, Harvey conned the possibilities of being bilked again. He saw
 none.


 ""Let's take a look at the menu, anyhow, Joe,"" he said guardedly.


 Johnson immediately fell into the role of ""mine host.""


 ""Come right in, gents,"" he invited. ""Right into the dining room.""


 He seated them at a table, which a rope tied between posts made more or
 less private, though nobody else was in the saloon and there was little
 chance of company.


 Genius, the six-armed native, appeared from the dingy kitchen with
 two menus in one hand, two glasses of water in another, plus napkins,
 silverware, a pitcher, plates, saucers, cups, and their cocktails,
 which were on the house. Then he stood by for orders.


 Harvey and Joe studied the menu critically. The prices were
 phenomenally low. When they glanced up at Johnson in perplexity, he
 grinned, bowed and asked: ""Everything satisfactory, gents?""


 ""Quite,"" said Harvey. ""We shall order.""


 For an hour they were served amazing dishes, both fresh and canned, the
 culinary wealth of this planetoid and all the system. And the service
 was as extraordinary as the meal itself. With four hands, Genius played
 deftly upon a pair of mellow Venusian
viotars
, using his other two
 hands for waiting on the table.


 ""We absolutely must purchase this incredible specimen,"" Harvey
 whispered excitedly when Johnson and the native were both in the
 kitchen, attending to the next course. ""He would make any society
 hostess's season a riotous success, which should be worth a great sum
 to women like Mrs. van Schuyler-Morgan, merely for his hire.""


 ""Think of a fast one fast,"" Joe agreed. ""You're right.""


 ""But I dislike having to revise my opinion of a man so often,""
 complained Harvey. ""I wish Johnson would stay either swindler or honest
 merchant. This dinner is worth as least twenty buckos, yet I estimate
 our check at a mere bucko twenty redsents.""


 The mayor's appearance prevented them from continuing the discussion.


 ""It's been a great honor, gents,"" he said. ""Ain't often I have
 visitors, and I like the best, like you two gents.""


 As if on cue, Genius came out and put the check down between Joe and
 Harvey. Harvey picked it up negligently, but his casual air vanished in
 a yelp of horror.


 ""What the devil is this?"" he shouted.—""How do you arrive at this
 fantastic, idiotic figure—
three hundred and twenty-eight buckos
!""
Johnson didn't answer. Neither did Genius; he simply put on the table,
 not a fingerbowl, but a magnifying glass. With one of his thirty
 fingers he pointed politely to the bottom of the menu.


 Harvey focused on the microscopic print, and his face went pasty with
 rage. The minute note read: ""Services and entertainment, 327 buckos 80
 redsents.""


 ""You can go to hell!"" Joe growled. ""We won't pay it!""


 Johnson sighed ponderously. ""I was afraid you'd act like that,"" he said
 with regret. He pulled a tin badge out of his rear pocket, pinned it on
 his vest, and twisted his holstered gun into view. ""Afraid I'll have to
 ask the sheriff to take over.""


 Johnson, the ""sheriff,"" collected the money, and Johnson, the
 ""restaurateur,"" pocketed it. Meanwhile, Harvey tipped Joe the sign to
 remain calm.


 ""My friend,"" he said to the mayor, and his tones took on a
 schoolmasterish severity, ""your long absence from Earth has perhaps
 made you forget those elements of human wisdom that have entered the
 folk-lore of your native planet. Such as, for example: 'It is folly
 to kill a goose that lays golden eggs,' and 'Penny wise is pound
 foolish.'""


 ""I don't get the connection,"" objected Johnson.


 ""Well, by obliging us to pay such a high price for your dinner, you put
 out of your reach the chance of profiting from a really substantial
 deal. My partner and I were prepared to make you a sizable offer for
 the peculiar creature you call Genius. But by reducing our funds the
 way you have—""


 ""Who said I wanted to sell him?"" the mayor interrupted. He rubbed his
 fingers together and asked disinterestedly: ""What were you going to
 offer, anyhow?""


 ""It doesn't matter any longer,"" Harvey said with elaborate
 carelessness. ""Perhaps you wouldn't have accepted it, anyway.""


 ""That's right,"" Johnson came back emphatically. ""But what would your
 offer have been which I would have turned down?""


 ""Which one? The one we were going to make, or the one we can make now?""


 ""Either one. It don't make no difference. Genius is too valuable to
 sell.""


 ""Oh, come now, Mr. Johnson. Don't tell me no amount of money would
 tempt you!""


 ""Nope. But how much did you say?""


 ""Ah, then you will consider releasing Genius!""


 ""Well, I'll tell you something,"" said the mayor confidentially. ""When
 you've got one thing, you've got one thing. But when you've got money,
 it's the same as having a lot of things. Because, if you've got money,
 you can buy this and that and this and that and—""


 ""This and that,"" concluded Joe. ""We'll give you five hundred buckos.""


 ""Now, gents!"" Johnson remonstrated. ""Why, six hundred would hardly—""


 ""You haven't left us much money,"" Harvey put in.


 The mayor frowned. ""All right, we'll split the difference. Make it
 five-fifty.""


 Harvey was quick to pay out, for this was a genuine windfall. Then he
 stood up and admired the astonishing possession he had so inexpensively
 acquired.


 ""I really hate to deprive you of this unique creature,"" he said to
 Johnson. ""I should imagine you will be rather lonely, with only your
 filial mammoth to keep you company.""


 ""I sure will,"" Johnson confessed glumly. ""I got pretty attached to
 Genius, and I'm going to miss him something awful.""


 Harvey forcibly removed his eyes from the native, who was clearing off
 the table almost all at once.


 ""My friend,"" he said, ""we take your only solace, it is true, but in his
 place we can offer something no less amazing and instructive.""


 The mayor's hand went protectively to his pocket. ""What is it?"" he
 asked with the suspicion of a man who has seen human nature at its
 worst and expects nothing better.


 ""Joseph, get our most prized belonging from the communications room of
 the ship,"" Harvey instructed. To Johnson he explained: ""You must see
 the wondrous instrument before its value can be appreciated. My partner
 will soon have it here for your astonishment.""


 Joe's face grew as glum as Johnson's had been. ""Aw, Harv,"" he
 protested, ""do we have to sell it? And right when I thought we were
 getting the key!""


 ""We must not be selfish, my boy,"" Harvey said nobly. ""We have had our
 chance; now we must relinquish Fate to the hands of a man who might
 have more success than we. Go, Joseph. Bring it here.""


 Unwillingly, Joe turned and shuffled out.
On a larger and heavier world than Planetoid 42, Johnson's curiosity
 would probably have had weight and mass. He was bursting with
 questions, but he was obviously afraid they would cost him money. For
 his part, Harvey allowed that curiosity to grow like a Venusian amoeba
 until Joe came in, lugging a radio.


 ""Is that what you were talking about?"" the mayor snorted. ""What makes
 you think I want a radio? I came here to get away from singers and
 political speech-makers.""


 ""Do not jump to hasty conclusions,"" Harvey cautioned. ""Another word,
 and I shall refuse you the greatest opportunity any man has ever had,
 with the sole exceptions of Joseph, myself and the unfortunate inventor
 of this absolutely awe-inspiring device.""


 ""I ain't in the market for a radio,"" Johnson said stubbornly.


 Harvey nodded in relief. ""We have attempted to repay our host, Joseph.
 He has spurned our generosity. We have now the chance to continue our
 study, which I am positive will soon reward us with the key to an
 enormous fortune.""


 ""Well, that's no plating off our bow,"" Joe grunted. ""I'm glad he did
 turn it down. I hated to give it up after working on it for three whole
 years.""


 He picked up the radio and began walking toward the door.


 ""Now, hold on!"" the mayor cried. ""I ain't
saying
I'll buy, but what
 is it I'm turning down?""


 Joe returned and set the instrument down on the bar. His face
 sorrowful, Harvey fondly stroked the scarred plasticoid cabinet.


 ""To make a long story, Mr. Johnson,"" he said, ""Joseph and I were among
 the chosen few who knew the famous Doctor Dean intimately. Just before
 his tragic death, you will recall, Dean allegedly went insane."" He
 banged his fist on the bar. ""I have said it before, and I repeat again,
 that was a malicious lie, spread by the doctor's enemies to discredit
 his greatest invention—this fourth dimensional radio!""


 ""This what?"" Johnson blurted out.


 ""In simple terms,"" clarified Harvey, ""the ingenious doctor discovered
 that the yawning chasm between the dimensions could be bridged by
 energy of all quanta. There has never been any question that the
 inhabitants of the super-dimension would be far more civilized than
 ourselves. Consequently, the man who could tap their knowledge would
 find himself in possession of a powerful, undreamt-of science!""


 The mayor looked respectfully at the silent box on the bar.


 ""And this thing gets broadcasts from the fourth dimension?""


 ""It does, Mr. Johnson! Only charlatans like those who envied Doctor
 Dean's magnificent accomplishments could deny that fact.""


 The mayor put his hands in his pockets, unswiveled one hip and stared
 thoughtfully at the battered cabinet.


 ""Well, let's say it picks up fourth dimensional broadcasts,"" he
 conceded. ""But how could you understand what they're saying? Folks up
 there wouldn't talk our language.""


 Again Harvey smashed his fist down. ""Do you dare to repeat the scurvy
 lie that broke Dean's spirit and drove him to suicide?""


 Johnson recoiled. ""No—no,
of course not
. I mean, being up here, I
 naturally couldn't get all the details.""


 ""Naturally,"" Harvey agreed, mollified. ""I'm sorry I lost my temper.
 But it is a matter of record that the doctor proved the broadcasts
 emanating from the super-dimension were in English! Why should that be
 so difficult to believe? Is it impossible that at one time there was
 communication between the dimensions, that the super-beings admired
 our language and adopted it in all its beauty, adding to it their own
 hyper-scientific trimmings?""


 ""Why, I don't know,"" Johnson said in confusion.


 ""For three years, Joseph and I lost sleep and hair, trying to detect
 the simple key that would translate the somewhat metamorphosed
 broadcasts into our primitive English. It eluded us. Even the doctor
 failed. But that was understandable; a sensitive soul like his could
 stand only so much. And the combination of ridicule and failure to
 solve the mystery caused him to take his own life.""


 Johnson winced. ""Is that what you want to unload on me?""


 ""For a very good reason, sir. Patience is the virtue that will be
 rewarded with the key to these fourth dimensional broadcasts. A man who
 could devote his life to improving this lonely worldlet is obviously a
 person with unusual patience.""


 ""Yeah,"" the mayor said grudgingly, ""I ain't exactly flighty.""


 ""Therefore, you are the man who could unravel the problem!""


 Johnson asked skeptically: ""How about a sample first?""

 Crossing
by Alan E. Nourse
JAMES BARON was not pleased to hear that he had had
 a visitor when he reached the Red Lion that evening. He
 had no stomach for mysteries, vast or trifling, and there
 were pressing things to think about at this time. Yet the doorman
 had flagged him as he came in from the street: “A thousand
 pardons, Mr. Baron. The gentleman—he would leave no
 name. He said you’d want to see him. He will be back by
 eight.”
Now Baron drummed his fingers on the table top, staring
 about the quiet lounge. Street trade was discouraged at the
 Red Lion, gently but persuasively; the patrons were few in
 number. Across to the right was a group that Baron knew
 vaguely—Andean climbers, or at least two of them were. Over
 near the door he recognized old Balmer, who had mapped
 the first passage to the core of Vulcan Crater on Venus. Baron
 returned his smile with a nod. Then he settled back and
 waited impatiently for the intruder who demanded his time
 without justifying it.
Presently a small, grizzled man crossed the room and sat
 down at Baron’s table. He was short and wiry. His face held
 no key to his age—he might have been thirty or a thousand—but
 he looked weary and immensely ugly. His cheeks and
 forehead were twisted and brown, with scars that were still
 healing.
The stranger said, “I’m glad you waited. I’ve heard you’re
 planning to attempt the Brightside.”
Baron stared at the man for a moment. “I see you can read
 telecasts,” he said coldly. “The news was correct. We are going
 to make a Brightside Crossing.”
“At perihelion?”
“Of course. When else?”
The grizzled man searched Baron’s face for a moment
 without expression. Then he said slowly, “No, I’m afraid you’re
 not going to make the Crossing.”
“Say, who are you, if you don’t mind?” Baron demanded.
“The name is Claney,” said the stranger.
There was a silence. Then: “Claney?
Peter
Claney?”
“That’s right.”
Baron’s eyes were wide with excitement, all trace of anger
 gone. “Great balls of fire, man—
where have you been hiding?
We’ve been trying to contact you for months!”
“I know. I was hoping you’d quit looking and chuck the
 whole idea.”
“Quit looking!” Baron bent forward over the table. “My
 friend, we’d given up hope, but we’ve never quit looking.
 Here, have a drink. There’s so much you can tell us.” His
 fingers were trembling.
Peter Claney shook his head. “I can’t tell you anything you
 want to hear.”
“But you’ve
got
to. You’re the only man on Earth who’s
 attempted a Brightside Crossing and lived through it! And the
 story you cleared for the news—it was nothing. We need
details
. Where did your equipment fall down? Where did you
 miscalculate? What were the trouble spots?” Baron jabbed a
 finger at Claney’s face. “That, for instance—epithelioma?
 Why? What was wrong with your glass? Your filters? We’ve
 got to know those things. If you can tell us, we can make
 it across where your attempt failed—”
“You want to know why we failed?” asked Claney.
“Of course we want to know. We
have
to know.”
“It’s simple. We failed because it can’t be done. We couldn’t
 do it and neither can you. No human beings will ever cross
 the Brightside alive, not if they try for centuries.”
“Nonsense,” Baron declared. “We will.”
Claney shrugged. “I was there. I know what I’m saying. You
 can blame the equipment or the men—there were flaws in
 both quarters—but we just didn’t know what we were fighting.
 It was the
planet
that whipped us, that and the
Sun
. They’ll
 whip you, too, if you try it.”
“Never,” said Baron.
“Let me tell you,” Peter Claney said.
I’d been interested in the Brightside for almost as long as
 I can remember (Claney said). I guess I was about ten when
 Wyatt and Carpenter made the last attempt—that was in 2082,
 I think. I followed the news stories like a tri-V serial and then
 I was heartbroken when they just disappeared.
I know now that they were a pair of idiots, starting off without
 proper equipment, with practically no knowledge of surface
 conditions, without any charts—they couldn’t have made
 a hundred miles—but I didn’t know that then and it was a
 terrible tragedy. After that, I followed Sanderson’s work in the
 Twilight Lab up there and began to get Brightside into my
 blood, sure as death.
But it was Mikuta’s idea to attempt a Crossing. Did you ever
 know Tom Mikuta? I don’t suppose you did. No, not Japanese—Polish-American.
 He was a major in the Interplanetary Service
 for some years and hung onto the title after he gave up
 his commission.
He was with Armstrong on Mars during his Service days,
 did a good deal of the original mapping and surveying for
 the Colony there. I first met him on Venus; we spent five
 years together up there doing some of the nastiest exploring
 since the Matto Grasso. Then he made the attempt on Vulcan
 Crater that paved the way for Balmer a few years later.
I’d always liked the Major—he was big and quiet and cool,
 the sort of guy who always had things figured a little further
 ahead than anyone else and always knew what to do in a tight
 place. Too many men in this game are all nerve and luck,
 with no judgment. The Major had both. He also had the kind
 of personality that could take a crew of wild men and
 make them work like a well-oiled machine across a thousand
 miles of Venus jungle. I liked him and I trusted him.
He contacted me in New York and he was very casual at
 first. We spent an evening here at the Red Lion, talking about
 old times; he told me about the Vulcan business, and how he’d
 been out to see Sanderson and the Twilight Lab on Mercury,
 and how he preferred a hot trek to a cold one any day of the
 year—and then he wanted to know what I’d been doing since
 Venus and what my plans were.
“No particular plans,” I told him. “Why?”
He looked me over. “How much do you weigh, Peter?”
I told him one-thirty-five.
“That much!” he said. “Well, there can’t be much fat on
 you, at any rate. How do you take heat?”
“You should know,” I said. “Venus was no icebox.”
“No, I mean
real
heat.”
Then I began to get it. “You’re planning a trip.”
“That’s right. A hot trip.” He grinned at me. “Might be
 dangerous, too.”
“What trip?”
“Brightside of Mercury,” the Major said.
I whistled cautiously. “At aphelion?”
He threw his head back. “Why try a Crossing at aphelion?
 What have you done then? Four thousand miles of butcherous
 heat, just to have some joker come along, use your data and
 drum you out of the glory by crossing at perihelion forty-four
 days later? No, thanks. I want the Brightside without any nonsense
 about it.” He leaned across me eagerly. “I want to make
 a Crossing at perihelion and I want to cross on the surface. If
 a man can do that, he’s got Mercury. Until then,
nobody’s
got
 Mercury. I want Mercury—but I’ll need help getting it.”
I’d thought of it a thousand times and never dared consider
 it. Nobody had, since Wyatt and Carpenter disappeared. Mercury
 turns on its axis in the same time that it wheels around
 the Sun, which means that the Brightside is always facing in.
 That makes the Brightside of Mercury at perihelion the hottest
 place in the Solar System, with one single exception: the
 surface of the Sun itself.
It would be a hellish trek. Only a few men had ever learned
 just
how
hellish and they never came back to tell about it. It
 was a real hell’s Crossing, but someday, I thought, somebody
 would cross it.
I wanted to be along.
The Twilight Lab, near the northern pole of Mercury, was the
 obvious jumping-off place. The setup there wasn’t very extensive—a
 rocket landing, the labs and quarters for Sanderson’s
 crew sunk deep into the crust, and the tower that housed
 the Solar ’scope that Sanderson had built up there ten years
 before.
Twilight Lab wasn’t particularly interested in the Brightside,
 of course—the Sun was Sanderson’s baby and he’d picked
 Mercury as the closest chunk of rock to the Sun that could
 hold his observatory. He’d chosen a good location, too. On
 Mercury, the Brightside temperature hits 770° F. at perihelion
 and the Darkside runs pretty constant at -410° F. No permanent
 installation with a human crew could survive at either
 extreme. But with Mercury’s wobble, the twilight zone between
 Brightside and Darkside offers something closer to survival
 temperatures.
Sanderson built the Lab up near the pole, where the zone
 is about five miles wide, so the temperature only varies 50 to
 60 degrees with the libration. The Solar ’scope could take that
 much change and they’d get good clear observation of the Sun
 for about seventy out of the eighty-eight days it takes the planet
 to wheel around.
The Major was counting on Sanderson knowing something
 about Mercury as well as the Sun when we camped at the Lab
 to make final preparations.
Sanderson did. He thought we’d lost our minds and he said
 so, but he gave us all the help he could. He spent a week
 briefing Jack Stone, the third member of our party, who had
 arrived with the supplies and equipment a few days earlier.
 Poor Jack met us at the rocket landing almost bawling, Sanderson
 had given him such a gloomy picture of what Brightside
 was like.
Stone was a youngster—hardly twenty-five, I’d say—but
 he’d been with the Major at Vulcan and had begged to join
 this trek. I had a funny feeling that Jack really didn’t care for
 exploring too much, but he thought Mikuta was God, followed
 him around like a puppy.
It didn’t matter to me as long as he knew what he was getting
 in for. You don’t go asking people in this game why they do it—they’re
 liable to get awfully uneasy and none of them can
 ever give you an answer that makes sense. Anyway, Stone had
 borrowed three men from the Lab, and had the supplies and
 equipment all lined up when we got there, ready to check
 and test.
We dug right in. With plenty of funds—tri-V money and
 some government cash the Major had talked his way around—our
 equipment was new and good. Mikuta had done the designing
 and testing himself, with a big assist from Sanderson.
 We had four Bugs, three of them the light pillow-tire models,
 with special lead-cooled cut-in engines when the heat set in,
 and one heavy-duty tractor model for pulling the sledges.
The Major went over them like a kid at the circus. Then he
 said, “Have you heard anything from McIvers?”
“Who’s he?” Stone wanted to know.
“He’ll be joining us. He’s a good man—got quite a name
 for climbing, back home.” The Major turned to me. “You’ve
 probably heard of him.”
I’d heard plenty of stories about Ted McIvers and I wasn’t
 too happy to hear that he was joining us. “Kind of a daredevil,
 isn’t he?”
“Maybe. He’s lucky and skillful. Where do you draw the
 line? We’ll need plenty of both.”
“Have you ever worked with him?” I asked.
“No. Are you worried?”
“Not exactly. But Brightside is no place to count on luck.”
The Major laughed. “I don’t think we need to worry about
 McIvers. We understood each other when I talked up the
 trip to him and we’re going to need each other too much to
 do any fooling around.” He turned back to the supply list.
 “Meanwhile, let’s get this stuff listed and packed. We’ll need
 to cut weight sharply and our time is short. Sanderson says
 we should leave in three days.”
Two days later, McIvers hadn’t arrived. The Major didn’t
 say much about it. Stone was getting edgy and so was I. We
 spent the second day studying charts of the Brightside, such as
 they were. The best available were pretty poor, taken from so
 far out that the detail dissolved into blurs on blow-up. They
 showed the biggest ranges of peaks and craters and faults, and
 that was all. Still, we could use them to plan a broad outline
 of our course.
“This range here,” the Major said as we crowded around
 the board, “is largely inactive, according to Sanderson. But
 these to the south and west
could
be active. Seismograph
 tracings suggest a lot of activity in that region, getting worse
 down toward the equator—not only volcanic, but sub-surface
 shifting.”
Stone nodded. “Sanderson told me there was probably constant
 surface activity.”
The Major shrugged. “Well, it’s treacherous, there’s no
 doubt of it. But the only way to avoid it is to travel over the
 Pole, which would lose us days and offer us no guarantee of
 less activity to the west. Now we might avoid some if we could
 find a pass through this range and cut sharp east—”
It seemed that the more we considered the problem, the
 further we got from a solution. We knew there were active
 volcanoes on the Brightside—even on the Darkside, though
 surface activity there was pretty much slowed down and
 localized.
But there were problems of atmosphere on Brightside, as
 well. There was an atmosphere and a constant atmospheric
 flow from Brightside to Darkside. Not much—the lighter gases
 had reached escape velocity and disappeared from Brightside
 millennia ago—but there was CO
 2
 , and nitrogen, and traces of
 other heavier gases. There was also an abundance of sulfur
 vapor, as well as carbon disulfide and sulfur dioxide.
The atmospheric tide moved toward the Darkside, where it
 condensed, carrying enough volcanic ash with it for Sanderson
 to estimate the depth and nature of the surface upheavals on
 Brightside from his samplings. The trick was to find a passage
 that avoided those upheavals as far as possible. But in the final
 analysis, we were barely scraping the surface. The only way
 we would find out what was happening where was to be there.
Finally, on the third day, McIvers blew in on a freight
 rocket from Venus. He’d missed the ship that the Major and
 I had taken by a few hours, and had conned his way to Venus
 in hopes of getting a hop from there. He didn’t seem too upset
 about it, as though this were his usual way of doing things and
 he couldn’t see why everyone should get so excited.
He was a tall, rangy man with long, wavy hair prematurely
 gray, and the sort of eyes that looked like a climber’s—half-closed,
 sleepy, almost indolent, but capable of abrupt alertness.
 And he never stood still; he was always moving, always doing
 something with his hands, or talking, or pacing about.
Evidently the Major decided not to press the issue of his
 arrival. There was still work to do, and an hour later we were
 running the final tests on the pressure suits. That evening,
 Stone and McIvers were thick as thieves, and everything was
 set for an early departure after we got some rest.
“And that,” said Baron, finishing his drink and signaling
 the waiter for another pair, “was your first big mistake.”
Peter Claney raised his eyebrows. “McIvers?”
“Of course.”
Claney shrugged, glanced at the small quiet tables around
 them. “There are lots of bizarre personalities around a place
 like this, and some of the best wouldn’t seem to be the most
 reliable at first glance. Anyway, personality problems weren’t
 our big problem right then.
Equipment
worried us first and
route
next.”
Baron nodded in agreement. “What kind of suits did you
 have?”
“The best insulating suits ever made,” said Claney. “Each
 one had an inner lining of a fiberglass modification, to avoid
 the clumsiness of asbestos, and carried the refrigerating unit
 and oxygen storage which we recharged from the sledges every
 eight hours. Outer layer carried a monomolecular chrome reflecting
 surface that made us glitter like Christmas trees. And
 we had a half-inch dead-air space under positive pressure between
 the two layers. Warning thermocouples, of course—at
 770 degrees, it wouldn’t take much time to fry us to cinders
 if the suits failed somewhere.”
“How about the Bugs?”
“They were insulated, too, but we weren’t counting on
 them too much for protection.”
“You weren’t!” Baron exclaimed. “Why not?”
“We’d be in and out of them too much. They gave us mobility
 and storage, but we knew we’d have to do a lot of
 forward work on foot.” Claney smiled bitterly. “Which meant
 that we had an inch of fiberglass and a half-inch of dead air
 between us and a surface temperature where lead flowed like
 water and zinc was almost at melting point and the pools of
 sulfur in the shadows were boiling like oatmeal over a campfire.”
Baron licked his lips. His fingers stroked the cool, wet glass
 as he set it down on the tablecloth.
“Go on,” he said tautly. “You started on schedule?”
“Oh, yes,” said Claney, “we started on schedule, all right.
 We just didn’t quite end on schedule, that was all. But I’m
 getting to that.”
He settled back in his chair and continued.
We jumped off from Twilight on a course due southeast
 with thirty days to make it to the Center of Brightside. If we
 could cross an average of seventy miles a day, we could hit
 Center exactly at perihelion, the point of Mercury’s closest
 approach to the Sun—which made Center the hottest part of
 the planet at the hottest it ever gets.
The Sun was already huge and yellow over the horizon
 when we started, twice the size it appears on Earth. Every day
 that Sun would grow bigger and whiter, and every day the
 surface would get hotter. But once we reached Center, the job
 was only half done—we would still have to travel another
 two thousand miles to the opposite twilight zone. Sanderson
 was to meet us on the other side in the Laboratory’s scout ship,
 approximately sixty days from the time we jumped off.
That was the plan, in outline. It was up to us to cross those
 seventy miles a day, no matter how hot it became, no matter
 what terrain we had to cross. Detours would be dangerous and
 time-consuming. Delays could cost us our lives. We all knew
 that.
The Major briefed us on details an hour before we left.
 “Peter, you’ll take the lead Bug, the small one we stripped
 down for you. Stone and I will flank you on either side, giving
 you a hundred-yard lead. McIvers, you’ll have the job of
 dragging the sledges, so we’ll have to direct your course pretty
 closely. Peter’s job is to pick the passage at any given point.
 If there’s any doubt of safe passage, we’ll all explore ahead
 on foot before we risk the Bugs. Got that?”
McIvers and Stone exchanged glances. McIvers said: “Jack
 and I were planning to change around. We figured he could
 take the sledges. That would give me a little more mobility.”
The Major looked up sharply at Stone. “Do you buy that,
 Jack?”
Stone shrugged. “I don’t mind. Mac wanted—”
McIvers made an impatient gesture with his hands. “It
 doesn’t matter. I just feel better when I’m on the move. Does
 it make any difference?”
“I guess it doesn’t,” said the Major. “Then you’ll flank
 Peter along with me. Right?”
“Sure, sure.” McIvers pulled at his lower lip. “Who’s going
 to do the advance scouting?”
“It sounds like I am,” I cut in. “We want to keep the lead
 Bug light as possible.”
Mikuta nodded. “That’s right. Peter’s Bug is stripped down
 to the frame and wheels.”
McIvers shook his head. “No, I mean the
advance
work.
 You need somebody out ahead—four or five miles, at least—to
 pick up the big flaws and active surface changes, don’t you?”
 He stared at the Major. “I mean, how can we tell what sort of
 a hole we may be moving into, unless we have a scout up
 ahead?”
“That’s what we have the charts for,” the Major said
 sharply.
“Charts! I’m talking about
detail
work. We don’t need to
 worry about the major topography. It’s the little faults you
 can’t see on the pictures that can kill us.” He tossed the charts
 down excitedly. “Look, let me take a Bug out ahead and work
 reconnaissance, keep five, maybe ten miles ahead of the column.
 I can stay on good solid ground, of course, but scan the
 area closely and radio back to Peter where to avoid the flaws.
 Then—”
“No dice,” the Major broke in.
“But why not? We could save ourselves days!”
“I don’t care what we could save. We stay together. When
 we get to the Center, I want live men along with me. That
 means we stay within easy sight of each other at all times. Any
 climber knows that everybody is safer in a party than one man
 alone—any time, any place.”
McIvers stared at him, his cheeks an angry red. Finally he
 gave a sullen nod. “Okay. If you say so.”
“Well, I say so and I mean it. I don’t want any fancy stuff.
 We’re going to hit Center together, and finish the Crossing together.
 Got that?”
McIvers nodded. Mikuta then looked at Stone and me and
 we nodded, too.
“All right,” he said slowly. “Now that we’ve got it straight,
 let’s go.”
It was hot. If I forget everything else about that trek, I’ll
 never forget that huge yellow Sun glaring down, without a
 break, hotter and hotter with every mile. We knew that the
 first few days would be the easiest and we were rested and
 fresh when we started down the long ragged gorge southeast of
 the Twilight Lab.
I moved out first; back over my shoulder, I could see the
 Major and McIvers crawling out behind me, their pillow tires
 taking the rugged floor of the gorge smoothly. Behind them,
 Stone dragged the sledges.
Even at only 30 per cent Earth gravity they were a strain on
 the big tractor, until the ski-blades bit into the fluffy volcanic
 ash blanketing the valley. We even had a path to follow for
 the first twenty miles.
I kept my eyes pasted to the big polaroid binocs, picking out
 the track the early research teams had made out into the edge
 of Brightside. But in a couple of hours we rumbled past Sanderson’s
 little outpost observatory and the tracks stopped. We
 were in virgin territory and already the Sun was beginning to
 bite.
We didn’t
feel
the heat so much those first days out. We
saw
it. The refrig units kept our skins at a nice comfortable seventy-five
 degrees Fahrenheit inside our suits, but our eyes watched
 that glaring Sun and the baked yellow rocks going past, and
 some nerve pathways got twisted up, somehow. We poured
 sweat as if we were in a superheated furnace.
We drove eight hours and slept five. When a sleep period
 came due, we pulled the Bugs together into a square, threw up
 a light aluminum sun-shield and lay out in the dust and rocks.
 The sun-shield cut the temperature down sixty or seventy
 degrees, for whatever help that was. And then we ate from the
 forward sledge—sucking through tubes—protein, carbohydrates,
 bulk gelatin, vitamins.
The Major measured water out with an iron hand, because
 we’d have drunk ourselves into nephritis in a week otherwise.
 We were constantly, unceasingly thirsty. Ask the physiologists
 and psychiatrists why—they can give you have a dozen interesting
 reasons—but all we knew, or cared about, was that it
 happened to be so.
We didn’t sleep the first few stops, as a consequence. Our
 eyes burned in spite of the filters and we had roaring headaches,
 but we couldn’t sleep them off. We sat around looking
 at each other. Then McIvers would say how good a beer would
 taste, and off we’d go. We’d have murdered our grandmothers
 for one ice-cold bottle of beer.
After a few driving periods, I began to get my bearings at
 the wheel. We were moving down into desolation that made
 Earth’s old Death Valley look like a Japanese rose garden.
 Huge sun-baked cracks opened up in the floor of the gorge,
 with black cliffs jutting up on either side; the air was filled
 with a barely visible yellowish mist of sulfur and sulfurous
 gases.
It was a hot, barren hole, no place for any man to go, but
 the challenge was so powerful you could almost feel it. No one
 had ever crossed this land before and escaped. Those who had
 tried it had been cruelly punished, but the land was still there,
 so it had to be crossed. Not the easy way. It had to be crossed
 the hardest way possible: overland, through anything the land
 could throw up to us, at the most difficult time possible.
Yet we knew that even the land might have been conquered
 before, except for that Sun. We’d fought absolute cold before
 and won. We’d never fought heat like this and won. The only
 worse heat in the Solar System was the surface of the Sun
 itself.
Brightside was worth trying for. We would get it or it would
 get us. That was the bargain.
I learned a lot about Mercury those first few driving periods.
 The gorge petered out after a hundred miles and we moved
 onto the slope of a range of ragged craters that ran south and
 east. This range had shown no activity since the first landing
 on Mercury forty years before, but beyond it there were active
 cones. Yellow fumes rose from the craters constantly; their
 sides were shrouded with heavy ash.
We couldn’t detect a wind, but we knew there was a hot,
 sulfurous breeze sweeping in great continental tides across the
 face of the planet. Not enough for erosion, though. The craters
 rose up out of jagged gorges, huge towering spears of rock and
 rubble. Below were the vast yellow flatlands, smoking and hissing
 from the gases beneath the crust. Over everything was gray
 dust—silicates and salts, pumice and limestone and granite
 ash, filling crevices and declivities—offering a soft, treacherous
 surface for the Bug’s pillow tires.
I learned to read the ground, to tell a covered fault by the
 sag of the dust; I learned to spot a passable crack, and tell it
 from an impassable cut. Time after time the Bugs ground to
 a halt while we explored a passage on foot, tied together with
 light copper cable, digging, advancing, digging some more
 until we were sure the surface would carry the machines. It
 was cruel work; we slept in exhaustion. But it went smoothly,
 at first.
Too smoothly, it seemed to me, and the others seemed to
 think so, too.
McIvers’ restlessness was beginning to grate on our nerves.
 He talked too much, while we were resting or while we were
 driving; wisecracks, witticisms, unfunny jokes that wore thin
 with repetition. He took to making side trips from the route
 now and then, never far, but a little further each time.
Jack Stone reacted quite the opposite; he grew quieter with
 each stop, more reserved and apprehensive. I didn’t like it, but
 I figured that it would pass off after a while. I was apprehensive
 enough myself; I just managed to hide it better.
And every mile the Sun got bigger and whiter and higher in
 the sky and hotter. Without our ultra-violet screens and glare
 filters we would have been blinded; as it was our eyes ached
 constantly and the skin on our faces itched and tingled at the
 end of an eight-hour trek.
But it took one of those side trips of McIvers’ to deliver the
 penultimate blow to our already fraying nerves. He had driven
 down a side-branch of a long canyon running off west of our
 route and was almost out of sight in a cloud of ash when we
 heard a sharp cry through our earphones.
I wheeled my Bug around with my heart in my throat and
 spotted him through the binocs, waving frantically from the
 top of his machine. The Major and I took off, lumbering down
 the gulch after him as fast as the Bugs could go, with a thousand
 horrible pictures racing through our minds....
We found him standing stock-still, pointing down the gorge
 and, for once, he didn’t have anything to say. It was the wreck
 of a Bug; an old-fashioned half-track model of the sort that
 hadn’t been in use for years. It was wedged tight in a cut in
 the rock, an axle broken, its casing split wide open up the
 middle, half-buried in a rock slide. A dozen feet away were
 two insulated suits with white bones gleaming through the
 fiberglass helmets.
This was as far as Wyatt and Carpenter had gotten on
their
Brightside Crossing.
On the fifth driving period out, the terrain began to change.
 It looked the same, but every now and then it
felt
different.
 On two occasions I felt my wheels spin, with a howl of protest
 from my engine. Then, quite suddenly, the Bug gave a lurch;
 I gunned my motor and nothing happened.
I could see the dull gray stuff seeping up around the hubs,
 thick and tenacious, splattering around in steaming gobs as
 the wheels spun. I knew what had happened the moment the
 wheels gave and, a few minutes later, they chained me to the
 tractor and dragged me back out of the mire. It looked for
 all the world like thick gray mud, but it was a pit of molten
 lead, steaming under a soft layer of concealing ash.
I picked my way more cautiously then. We were getting into
 an area of recent surface activity; the surface was really treacherous.
 I caught myself wishing that the Major had okayed
 McIvers’ scheme for an advanced scout; more dangerous for
 the individual, maybe, but I was driving blind now and I didn’t
 like it.
One error in judgment could sink us all, but I wasn’t thinking
 much about the others. I was worried about
me
, plenty
 worried. I kept thinking, better McIvers should go than me.
 It wasn’t healthy thinking and I knew it, but I couldn’t get the
 thought out of my mind.
It was a grueling eight hours and we slept poorly. Back in
 the Bug again, we moved still more slowly—edging out on a
 broad flat plateau, dodging a network of gaping surface cracks—winding
 back and forth in an effort to keep the machines on
 solid rock. I couldn’t see far ahead, because of the yellow haze
 rising from the cracks, so I was almost on top of it when I saw
 a sharp cut ahead where the surface dropped six feet beyond
 a deep crack.
I let out a shout to halt the others; then I edged my Bug
 forward, peering at the cleft. It was deep and wide. I moved
 fifty yards to the left, then back to the right.
There was only one place that looked like a possible crossing;
 a long, narrow ledge of gray stuff that lay down across
 a section of the fault like a ramp. Even as I watched it, I could
 feel the surface crust under the Bug trembling and saw the
 ledge shift over a few feet.

 GREEN

 BERET
By TOM PURDOM
It's not so much the decisions a man does make that mark
 him as a Man—but the ones he refrains from making. Like the
 decision ""I've had enough!""
Illustrated by Schoenherr
Read locked the door and drew his pistol. Sergeant Rashid handed
 Premier Umluana the warrant.


 ""We're from the UN Inspector Corps,"" Sergeant Rashid said. ""I'm
 very sorry, but we have to arrest you and bring you in for trial
 by the World Court.""


 If Umluana noticed Read's gun, he didn't show it. He read the
 warrant carefully. When he finished, he said something in Dutch.


 ""I don't know your language,"" Rashid said.


 ""Then I'll speak English."" Umluana was a small man with wrinkled
 brow, glasses and a mustache. His skin was a shade lighter than
 Read's. ""The Inspector General doesn't have the power to arrest a
 head of state—especially the Premier of Belderkan. Now, if
 you'll excuse me, I must return to my party.""


 In the other room people laughed and talked. Glasses clinked in
 the late afternoon. Read knew two armed men stood just outside
 the door. ""If you leave, Premier, I'll have to shoot you.""


 ""I don't think so,"" Umluana said. ""No, if you kill me, all Africa
 will rise against the world. You don't want me dead. You want me
 in court.""


 Read clicked off the safety.


 ""Corporal Read is very young,"" Rashid said, ""but he's a crack
 shot. That's why I brought him with me. I think he
likes
to
 shoot, too.""


 Umluana turned back to Rashid a second too soon. He saw the
 sergeant's upraised hand before it collided with his neck.


 ""Help!
Kidnap.
""


 Rashid judo chopped him and swung the inert body over his
 shoulders. Read pulled a flat grenade from his vest pocket. He
 dropped it and yellow psycho gas hissed from the valve.


 ""Let's be off,"" Rashid said.


 The door lock snapped as they went out the window. Two men with
 rifles plunged into the gas; sighing, they fell to the floor in a
 catatonic trance.


 A little car skimmed across the lawn. Bearing the Scourge of
 Africa, Rashid struggled toward it. Read walked backward,
 covering their retreat.


 The car stopped, whirling blades holding it a few inches off the
 lawn. They climbed in.


 ""How did it go?"" The driver and another inspector occupied the
 front seat.


 ""They'll be after us in half a minute.""


 The other inspector carried a light machine gun and a box of
 grenades. ""I better cover,"" he said.


 ""Thanks,"" Rashid said.


 The inspector slid out of the car and ran to a clump of bushes.
 The driver pushed in the accelerator. As they swerved toward the
 south, Read saw a dozen armed men run out of the house. A grenade
 arced from the bushes and the pursuers recoiled from the cloud
 that rose before them.


 ""Is he all right?"" the driver asked.


 ""I don't think I hurt him."" Rashid took a syrette from his vest
 pocket. ""Well, Read, it looks like we're in for a fight. In a few
 minutes Miaka Station will know we're coming. And God knows what
 will happen at the Game Preserve.""


 Read wanted to jump out of the car. He could die any minute. But
 he had set his life on a well-oiled track and he couldn't get off
 until they reached Geneva.


 ""They don't know who's coming,"" he said. ""They don't make them
 tough enough to stop this boy.""


 Staring straight ahead, he didn't see the sergeant smile.
Two types of recruits are accepted by the UN Inspector Corps:
 those with a fanatic loyalty to the ideals of peace and world
 order, and those who are loyal to nothing but themselves. Read
 was the second type.


 A tall, lanky Negro he had spent his school days in one of the
 drab suburbs that ring every prosperous American city. It was the
 home of factory workers, clerks, semiskilled technicians, all who
 do the drudge work of civilization and know they will never do
 more. The adults spent their days with television, alcohol and
 drugs; the young spent their days with gangs, sex, television and
 alcohol. What else was there? Those who could have told him
 neither studied nor taught at his schools. What he saw on the
 concrete fields between the tall apartment houses marked the
 limits of life's possibilities.


 He had belonged to a gang called The Golden Spacemen. ""Nobody
 fools with me,"" he bragged. ""When Harry Read's out, there's a
 tiger running loose."" No one knew how many times he nearly ran
 from other clubs, how carefully he picked the safest spot on the
 battle line.


 ""A man ought to be a man,"" he once told a girl. ""He ought to do a
 man's work. Did you ever notice how our fathers look, how they
 sleep so much? I don't want to be like that. I want to be
 something proud.""


 He joined the UN Inspector Corps at eighteen, in 1978. The
 international cops wore green berets, high buttonless boots, bush
 jackets. They were very special men.


 For the first time in his life, his father said something about
 his ambitions.


 ""Don't you like America, Harry? Do you
want
to be without a
 country? This is the best country in the world. All my life I've
 made a good living. Haven't you had everything you ever wanted?
 I've been a king compared to people overseas. Why, you stay here
 and go to trade school and in two years you'll be living just
 like me.""


 ""I don't want that,"" Read said.


 ""What do you mean, you don't want that?""


 ""You could join the American Army,"" his mother said. ""That's as
 good as a trade school. If you have to be a soldier.""


 ""I want to be a UN man. I've already enlisted. I'm in! What do
 you care what I do?""


 The UN Inspector Corps had been founded to enforce the Nuclear
 Disarmament Treaty of 1966. Through the years it had acquired
 other jobs. UN men no longer went unarmed. Trained to use small
 arms and gas weapons, they guarded certain borders, bodyguarded
 diplomats and UN officials, even put down riots that threatened
 international peace. As the UN evolved into a strong world
 government, the UN Inspector Corps steadily acquired new powers.


 Read went through six months training on Madagascar.


 Twice he nearly got expelled for picking fights with smaller men.
 Rather than resign, he accepted punishment which assigned him to
 weeks of dull, filthy extra labor. He hated the restrictions and
 the iron fence of regulations. He hated boredom, loneliness and
 isolation.


 And yet he responded with enthusiasm. They had given him a job. A
 job many people considered important.


 He took his turn guarding the still disputed borders of Korea. He
 served on the rescue teams that patrol the busy Polar routes. He
 mounted guard at the 1980 World's Fair in Rangoon.


 ""I liked Rangoon,"" he even told a friend. ""I even liked Korea.
 But I think I liked the Pole job best. You sit around playing
 cards and shooting the bull and then there's a plane crash or
 something and you go out and win a medal. That's great for me.
 I'm lazy and I like excitement.""
One power implied in the UN Charter no Secretary General or
 Inspector General had ever tried to use. The power to arrest any
 head of state whose country violated international law. Could the
 World Court try and imprison a politician who had conspired to
 attack another nation?


 For years Africa had been called ""The South America of the Old
 World."" Revolution followed revolution. Colonies became
 democracies. Democracies became dictatorships or dissolved in
 civil war. Men planted bases on the moon and in four years,
 1978-82, ringed the world with matter transmitters; but the black
 population of Africa still struggled toward political equality.


 Umluana took control of Belderkan in 1979. The tiny, former Dutch
 colony, had been a tottering democracy for ten years. The very
 day he took control the new dictator and his African party began
 to build up the Belderkan Army. For years he had preached a new
 Africa, united, free of white masters, the home of a vigorous and
 perfect Negro society. His critics called him a hypocritical
 racist, an opportunist using the desires of the African people to
 build himself an empire.


 He began a propaganda war against neighboring South Africa,
 promising the liberation of that strife-torn land. Most Negro
 leaders, having just won representation in the South African
 Parliament, told him to liberate his own country. They believed
 they could use their first small voice in the government to win
 true freedom for their people.


 But the radio assault and the arms buildup continued. Early in
 1982, South Africa claimed the Belderkan Army exceeded the size
 agreed to in the Disarmament Treaty. The European countries and
 some African nations joined in the accusation. China called the
 uproar a vicious slur on a new African nation. The United States
 and Russia, trying not to get entangled, asked for more
 investigation by the UN.


 But the evidence was clear. Umluana was defying world law. If he
 got away with it, some larger and more dangerous nation might
 follow his precedent. And the arms race would begin again.


 The Inspector General decided. They would enter Belderkan, arrest
 Umluana and try him by due process before the World Court. If the
 plan succeeded, mankind would be a long step farther from nuclear
 war.


 Read didn't know much about the complicated political reasons for
 the arrest. He liked the Corp and he liked being in the Corp. He
 went where they sent him and did what they told him to do.
The car skimmed above the tree-tops. The driver and his two
 passengers scanned the sky.


 A plane would have been a faster way to get out of the country.
 But then they would have spent hours flying over Africa, with
 Belderkan fighters in hot pursuit, other nations joining the
 chase and the world uproar gaining volume. By transmitter, if all
 went well, they could have Umluana in Geneva in an hour.


 They were racing toward Miaka, a branch transmitter station. From
 Miaka they would transmit to the Belderkan Preserve, a famous
 tourist attraction whose station could transmit to any point on
 the globe. Even now a dozen inspectors were taking over the Game
 Preserve station and manning its controls.


 They had made no plans to take over Miaka. They planned to get
 there before it could be defended.


 ""There's no military base near Miaka,"" Rashid said. ""We might get
 there before the Belderkans.""


 ""Here comes our escort,"" Read said.


 A big car rose from the jungle. This one had a recoilless rifle
 mounted on the roof. The driver and the gunner waved and fell in
 behind them.


 ""One thing,"" Read said, ""I don't think they'll shoot at us while
he's
in the car.""


 ""Don't be certain, corporal. All these strong-arm movements are
 alike. I'll bet Umluana's lieutenants are hoping he'll become a
 dead legend. Then they can become live conquerors.""


 Sergeant Rashid came from Cairo. He had degrees in science and
 history from Cambridge but only the Corp gave him work that
 satisfied his conscience. He hated war. It was that simple.


 Read looked back. He saw three spots of sunlight about two
 hundred feet up and a good mile behind.


 ""Here they come, Sarge.""


 Rashid turned his head. He waved frantically. The two men in the
 other car waved back.


 ""Shall I duck under the trees?"" the driver asked.


 ""Not yet. Not until we have to.""


 Read fingered the machine gun he had picked up when he got in the
 car. He had never been shot at. Twice he had faced an unarmed
 mob, but a few shots had sent them running.


 Birds flew screaming from their nests. Monkeys screeched and
 threw things at the noisy, speeding cars. A little cloud of birds
 surrounded each vehicle.


 The escort car made a sharp turn and charged their pursuers. The
 big rifle fired twice. Read saw the Belderkan cars scatter.
 Suddenly machine-gun bullets cracked and whined beside him.


 ""Evade,"" Rashid said. ""Don't go down.""


 Without losing any forward speed, the driver took them straight
 up. Read's stomach bounced.


 A shell exploded above them. The car rocked. He raised his eyes
 and saw a long crack in the roof.


 ""Hit the floor,"" Rashid said.


 They knelt on the cramped floor. Rashid put on his gas mask and
 Read copied him. Umluana breathed like a furnace, still
 unconscious from the injection Rashid had given him.
I can't do anything
, Read thought.
They're too far away to
 shoot back. All we can do is run.
The sky was clear and blue. The jungle was a noisy bazaar of
 color. In the distance guns crashed. He listened to shells
 whistle by and the whipcrack of machine-gun bullets. The car
 roller-coastered up and down. Every time a shell passed, he
 crawled in waves down his own back.


 Another explosion, this time very loud.


 Rashid raised his eyes above the seat and looked out the rear
 window. ""Two left. Keep down, Read.""


 ""Can't we go down?"" Read said.


 ""They'll get to Miaka before us.""


 He shut his eyes when he heard another loud explosion.


 Sergeant Rashid looked out the window again. He swore bitterly in
 English and Egyptian. Read raised his head. The two cars behind
 them weren't fighting each other. A long way back the tree-tops
 burned.


 ""How much farther?"" Rashid said. The masks muffled their voices.


 ""There it is now. Shall I take us right in?""


 ""I think you'd better.""
The station was a glass diamond in a small clearing. The driver
 slowed down, then crashed through the glass walls and hovered by
 the transmitter booth.


 Rashid opened the door and threw out two grenades. Read jumped
 out and the two of them struggled toward the booth with Umluana.
 The driver, pistol in hand, ran for the control panel.


 There were three technicians in the station and no passengers.
 All three panicked when the psycho gas enveloped them. They ran
 howling for the jungle.


 Through the window of his mask, Read saw their pursuers land in
 the clearing. Machine-gun bullets raked the building. They got
 Umluana in the booth and hit the floor. Read took aim and opened
 fire on the largest car.


 ""Now, I can shoot back,"" he said. ""Now we'll see what they do.""


 ""Are you ready, Rashid?"" yelled the driver.


 ""Man, get us out of here!""


 The booth door shut. When it opened, they were at the Game
 Preserve.


 The station jutted from the side of a hill. A glass-walled
 waiting room surrounded the bank of transmitter booths. Read
 looked out the door and saw his first battlefield.


 Directly in front of him, his head shattered by a bullet, a dead
 inspector lay behind an overturned couch.


 Read had seen dozens of training films taken during actual
 battles or after atomic attacks. He had laughed when other
 recruits complained. ""That's the way this world is. You people
 with the weak stomachs better get used to it.""


 Now he slid against the rear wall of the transmitter booth.


 A wounded inspector crawled across the floor to the booth. Read
 couldn't see his wound, only the pain scratched on his face and
 the blood he deposited on the floor.


 ""Did you get Umluana?"" he asked Sergeant Rashid.


 ""He's in the booth. What's going on?"" Rashid's Middle East Oxford
 seemed more clipped than ever.


 ""They hit us with two companies of troops a few minutes ago. I
 think half our men are wounded.""


 ""Can we get out of here?""


 ""They machine-gunned the controls.""


 Rashid swore. ""You heard him, Read! Get out there and help those
 men.""


 He heard the screams of the wounded, the crack of rifles and
 machine guns, all the terrifying noise of war. But since his
 eighteenth year he had done everything his superiors told him to
 do.


 He started crawling toward an easy-chair that looked like good
 cover. A bullet cracked above his head, so close he felt the
 shock wave. He got up, ran panicky, crouched, and dove behind the
 chair.


 An inspector cracked the valve on a smoke grenade. A white fog
 spread through the building. They could see anyone who tried to
 rush them but the besiegers couldn't pick out targets.


 Above the noise, he heard Rashid.


 ""I'm calling South Africa Station for a copter. It's the only way
 out of here. Until it comes, we've got to hold them back.""


 Read thought of the green beret he had stuffed in his pocket that
 morning. He stuck it on his head and cocked it. He didn't need
 plain clothes anymore and he wanted to wear at least a part of
 his uniform.


 Bullets had completely shattered the wall in front of him. He
 stared through the murk, across the broken glass. He was Corporal
 Harry Read, UN Inspector Corps—a very special man. If he didn't
 do a good job here, he wasn't the man he claimed to be. This
 might be the only real test he would ever face.
He heard a shout in rapid French. He turned to his right. Men in
 red loincloths ran zigzagging toward the station. They carried
 light automatic rifles. Half of them wore gas masks.


 ""Shoot the masks,"" he yelled. ""Aim for the masks.""


 The machine gun kicked and chattered on his shoulder. He picked a
 target and squeezed off a burst. Tensely, he hunted for another
 mask. Three grenades arced through the air and yellow gas spread
 across the battlefield. The attackers ran through it. A few yards
 beyond the gas, some of them turned and ran for their own lines.
 In a moment only half a dozen masked men still advanced. The
 inspectors fired a long, noisy volley. When they stopped only
 four attackers remained on their feet. And they were running for
 cover.


 The attackers had come straight up a road that led from the Game
 Preserve to the station. They had not expected any resistance.
 The UN men had already taken over the station, chased out the
 passengers and technicians and taken up defense positions; they
 had met the Belderkans with a dozen grenades and sent them
 scurrying for cover. The fight so far had been vicious but
 disorganized. But the Belderkans had a few hundred men and knew
 they had wrecked the transmitter controls.


 The first direct attack had been repulsed. They could attack many
 more times and continue to spray the building with bullets. They
 could also try to go around the hill and attack the station from
 above; if they did, the inspectors had a good view of the hill
 and should see them going up.


 The inspectors had taken up good defensive positions. In spite of
 their losses, they still had enough firepower to cover the area
 surrounding the station.


 Read surveyed his sector of fire. About two hundred yards to his
 left, he saw the top of a small ditch. Using the ditch for cover,
 the Belderkans could sneak to the top of the hill.


 Gas grenades are only three inches long. They hold cubic yards of
 gas under high pressure. Read unclipped a telescoping rod from
 his vest pocket. He opened it and a pair of sights flipped up. A
 thin track ran down one side.


 He had about a dozen grenades left, three self-propelling. He
 slid an SP grenade into the rod's track and estimated windage and
 range. Sighting carefully, not breathing, muscles relaxed, the
 rod rock steady, he fired and lobbed the little grenade into the
 ditch. He dropped another grenade beside it.


 The heavy gas would lie there for hours.


 Sergeant Rashid ran crouched from man to man. He did what he
 could to shield the wounded.


 ""Well, corporal, how are you?""


 ""Not too bad, sergeant. See that ditch out there? I put a little
 gas in it.""


 ""Good work. How's your ammunition?""


 ""A dozen grenades. Half a barrel of shells.""


 ""The copter will be here in half an hour. We'll put Umluana on,
 then try to save ourselves. Once he's gone, I think we ought to
 surrender.""


 ""How do you think they'll treat us?""


 ""That we'll have to see.""


 An occasional bullet cracked and whined through the misty room.
 Near him a man gasped frantically for air. On the sunny field a
 wounded man screamed for help.


 ""There's a garage downstairs,"" Rashid said. ""In case the copter
 doesn't get here on time, I've got a man filling wine bottles
 with gasoline.""


 ""We'll stop them, Sarge. Don't worry.""
Rashid ran off. Read stared across the green land and listened to
 the pound of his heart. What were the Belderkans planning? A mass
 frontal attack? To sneak in over the top of the hill?


 He didn't think, anymore than a rabbit thinks when it lies hiding
 from the fox or a panther thinks when it crouches on a branch
 above the trail. His skin tightened and relaxed on his body.


 ""Listen,"" said a German.


 Far down the hill he heard the deep-throated rumble of a big
 motor.


 ""Armor,"" the German said.


 The earth shook. The tank rounded the bend. Read watched the
 squat, angular monster until its stubby gun pointed at the
 station. It stopped less than two hundred yards away.


 A loud-speaker blared.


 ATTENTION UN SOLDIERS.

 ATTENTION UN SOLDIERS.

 YOU MAY THINK US SAVAGES

 BUT WE HAVE MODERN WEAPONS.

 WE HAVE ATOMIC WARHEADS,

 ALL GASES, ROCKETS

 AND FLAME THROWERS. IF

 YOU DO NOT SURRENDER

 OUR PREMIER, WE WILL DESTROY YOU.



 ""They know we don't have any big weapons,"" Read said. ""They know
 we have only gas grenades and small arms.""


 He looked nervously from side to side. They couldn't bring the
 copter in with that thing squatting out there.


 A few feet away, sprawled behind a barricade of tables, lay a man
 in advanced shock. His deadly white skin shone like ivory. They
 wouldn't even look like that. One nuclear shell from that gun and
 they'd be vaporized. Or perhaps the tank had sonic projectors;
 then the skin would peel off their bones. Or they might be
 burned, or cut up by shrapnel, or gassed with some new mist their
 masks couldn't filter.


 Read shut his eyes. All around him he heard heavy breathing,
 mumbled comments, curses. Clothes rustled as men moved restlessly.


 But already the voice of Sergeant Rashid resounded in the murky
 room.


 ""We've got to knock that thing out before the copter comes.
 Otherwise, he can't land. I have six Molotov cocktails here. Who
 wants to go hunting with me?""


 For two years Read had served under Sergeant Rashid. To him, the
 sergeant was everything a UN inspector should be. Rashid's
 devotion to peace had no limits.


 Read's psych tests said pride alone drove him on. That was good
 enough for the UN; they only rejected men whose loyalties might
 conflict with their duties. But an assault on the tank required
 something more than a hunger for self-respect.


 Read had seen the inspector who covered their getaway. He had
 watched their escort charge three-to-one odds. He had seen
 another inspector stay behind at Miaka Station. And here, in this
 building, lay battered men and dead men.


 All UN inspectors. All part of his life.


 And he was part of their life. Their blood, their sacrifice, and
 pain, had become a part of him.


 ""I'll take a cocktail, Sarge.""


 ""Is that Read?""


 ""Who else did you expect?""


 ""Nobody. Anybody else?""


 ""I'll go,"" the Frenchman said. ""Three should be enough. Give us a
 good smoke screen.""
Rashid snapped orders. He put the German inspector in charge of
 Umluana. Read, the Frenchman and himself, he stationed at
 thirty-foot intervals along the floor.


 ""Remember,"" Rashid said. ""We have to knock out that gun.""


 Read had given away his machine gun. He held a gas-filled bottle
 in each hand. His automatic nestled in its shoulder holster.


 Rashid whistled.


 Dozens of smoke grenades tumbled through the air. Thick mist
 engulfed the tank. Read stood up and ran forward. He crouched but
 didn't zigzag. Speed counted most here.


 Gunfire shook the hill. The Belderkans couldn't see them but they
 knew what was going on and they fired systematically into the
 smoke.


 Bullets ploughed the ground beside him. He raised his head and
 found the dim silhouette of the tank. He tried not to think about
 bullets ploughing through his flesh.


 A bullet slammed into his hip. He fell on his back, screaming.
 ""Sarge.
Sarge.
""


 ""I'm hit, too,"" Rashid said. ""Don't stop if you can move.""
Listen to him. What's he got, a sprained ankle?
But he didn't feel any pain. He closed his eyes and threw himself
 onto his stomach. And nearly fainted from pain. He screamed and
 quivered. The pain stopped. He stretched out his hands, gripping
 the wine bottles, and inched forward. Pain stabbed him from
 stomach to knee.


 ""I can't move, Sarge.""


 ""Read, you've got to. I think you're the only—""


 ""What?""


 Guns clattered. Bullets cracked.


 ""Sergeant Rashid! Answer me.""


 He heard nothing but the lonely passage of the bullets in the
 mist.


 ""I'm a UN man,"" he mumbled. ""You people up there know what a UN
 man is? You know what happens when you meet one?""


 When he reached the tank, he had another bullet in his right arm.
 But they didn't know he was coming and when you get within ten
 feet of a tank, the men inside can't see you.


 He just had to stand up and drop the bottle down the gun barrel.
 That was all—with a broken hip and a wounded right arm.


 He knew they would see him when he stood up but he didn't think
 about that. He didn't think about Sergeant Rashid, about the
 complicated politics of Africa, about crowded market streets. He
 had to kill the tank. That was all he thought about. He had
 decided something in the world was more important than himself,
 but he didn't know it or realize the psychologists would be
 surprised to see him do this. He had made many decisions in the
 last few minutes. He had ceased to think about them or anything
 else.


 With his cigarette lighter, he lit the rag stuffed in the end of
 the bottle.


 Biting his tongue, he pulled himself up the front of the tank.
 His long arm stretched for the muzzle of the gun. He tossed the
 bottle down the dark throat.


 As he fell, the machine-gun bullets hit him in the chest, then in
 the neck. He didn't feel them. He had fainted the moment he felt
 the bottle leave his hand.


 The copter landed ten minutes later. Umluana left in a shower of
 bullets. A Russian private, the ranking man alive in the station,
 surrendered the survivors to the Belderkans.
His mother hung the Global Medal above the television set.


 ""He must have been brave,"" she said. ""We had a fine son.""


 ""He was our only son,"" her husband said. ""What did he volunteer
 for? Couldn't somebody else have done it?""


 His wife started to cry. Awkwardly, he embraced her. He wondered
 what his son had wanted that he couldn't get at home.

Revolt was brewing on Venus, led by the

 descendant of the first Earthmen to

 land. Svan was the leader making the final

 plans—plotting them a bit too well.

The Officer of the Deck was pleased as he returned to the main lock.
 There was no reason why everything shouldn't have been functioning
 perfectly, of course, but he was pleased to have it confirmed, all the
 same. The Executive Officer was moodily smoking a cigarette in the open
 lock, staring out over the dank Venusian terrain at the native town. He
 turned.


 ""Everything shipshape, I take it!"" he commented.


 The OD nodded. ""I'll have a blank log if this keeps up,"" he said.
 ""Every man accounted for except the delegation, cargo stowed, drivers
 ready to lift as soon as they come back.""


 The Exec tossed away his cigarette. ""
If
they come back.""


 ""Is there any question?""


 The Exec shrugged. ""I don't know, Lowry,"" he said. ""This is a funny
 place. I don't trust the natives.""


 Lowry lifted his eyebrows. ""Oh? But after all, they're human beings,
 just like us—""


 ""Not any more. Four or five generations ago they were. Lord, they don't
 even look human any more. Those white, flabby skins—I don't like them.""


 ""Acclimation,"" Lowry said scientifically. ""They had to acclimate
 themselves to Venus's climate. They're friendly enough.""


 The Exec shrugged again. He stared at the wooden shacks that were the
 outskirts of the native city, dimly visible through the ever-present
 Venusian mist. The native guard of honor, posted a hundred yards from
 the Earth-ship, stood stolidly at attention with their old-fashioned
 proton-rifles slung over their backs. A few natives were gazing
 wonderingly at the great ship, but made no move to pass the line of
 guards.


 ""Of course,"" Lowry said suddenly, ""there's a minority who are afraid
 of us. I was in town yesterday, and I talked with some of the natives.
 They think there will be hordes of immigrants from Earth, now that we
 know Venus is habitable. And there's some sort of a paltry underground
 group that is spreading the word that the immigrants will drive the
 native Venusians—the descendants of the first expedition, that
 is—right down into the mud. Well—"" he laughed—""maybe they will.
 After all, the fittest survive. That's a basic law of—""


 The annunciator over the open lock clanged vigorously, and a metallic
 voice rasped: ""Officer of the Deck! Post Number One! Instruments
 reports a spy ray focused on the main lock!""


 Lowry, interrupted in the middle of a word, jerked his head back and
 stared unbelievingly at the tell-tale next to the annunciator. Sure
 enough, it was glowing red—might have been glowing for minutes. He
 snatched at the hand-phone dangling from the wall, shouted into it.
 ""Set up a screen! Notify the delegation! Alert a landing party!"" But
 even while he was giving orders, the warning light flickered suddenly
 and went out. Stricken, Lowry turned to the Exec.


 The Executive Officer nodded gloomily. He said, ""You see!""
""You see?""


 Svan clicked off the listening-machine and turned around. The five
 others in the room looked apprehensive. ""You see?"" Svan repeated. ""From
 their own mouths you have heard it. The Council was right.""


 The younger of the two women sighed. She might have been beautiful, in
 spite of her dead-white skin, if there had been a scrap of hair on her
 head. ""Svan, I'm afraid,"" she said. ""Who are we to decide if this
 is a good thing? Our parents came from Earth. Perhaps there will be
 trouble at first, if colonists come, but we are of the same blood.""


 Svan laughed harshly. ""
They
don't think so. You heard them. We are
 not human any more. The officer said it.""


 The other woman spoke unexpectedly. ""The Council was right,"" she
 agreed. ""Svan, what must we do?""


 Svan raised his hand, thoughtfully. ""One moment. Ingra, do you still
 object?""


 The younger woman shrank back before the glare in his eyes. She looked
 around at the others, found them reluctant and uneasy, but visibly
 convinced by Svan.


 ""No,"" she said slowly. ""I do not object.""


 ""And the rest of us? Does any of us object?""


 Svan eyed them, each in turn. There was a slow but unanimous gesture of
 assent.


 ""Good,"" said Svan. ""Then we must act. The Council has told us that we
 alone will decide our course of action. We have agreed that, if the
 Earth-ship returns, it means disaster for Venus. Therefore, it must not
 return.""


 An old man shifted restlessly. ""But they are strong, Svan,"" he
 complained. ""They have weapons. We cannot force them to stay.""


 Svan nodded. ""No. They will leave. But they will never get back to
 Earth.""


 ""Never get back to Earth?"" the old man gasped. ""Has the Council
 authorized—murder?""


 Svan shrugged. ""The Council did not know what we would face. The
 Councilmen could not come to the city and see what strength the
 Earth-ship has."" He paused dangerously. ""Toller,"" he said, ""do you
 object?""


 Like the girl, the old man retreated before his eyes. His voice was
 dull. ""What is your plan?"" he asked.


 Svan smiled, and it was like a dark flame. He reached to a box at his
 feet, held up a shiny metal globe. ""One of us will plant this in the
 ship. It will be set by means of this dial—"" he touched a spot on the
 surface of the globe with a pallid finger—""to do nothing for forty
 hours. Then—it will explode. Atomite.""


 He grinned triumphantly, looking from face to face. The grin
 faded uncertainly as he saw what was in their eyes—uncertainty,
 irresolution. Abruptly he set the bomb down, savagely ripped six leaves
 off a writing tablet on the table next him. He took a pencil and made a
 mark on one of them, held it up.


 ""We will let chance decide who is to do the work,"" he said angrily. ""Is
 there anyone here who is afraid? There will be danger, I think....""


 No answer. Svan jerked his head. ""Good,"" he said. ""Ingra, bring me that
 bowl.""


 Silently the girl picked up an opaque glass bowl from the broad arm
 of her chair. It had held Venus-tobacco cigarettes; there were a few
 left. She shook them out and handed the bowl to Svan, who was rapidly
 creasing the six fatal slips. He dropped them in the bowl, stirred it
 with his hand, offered it to the girl. ""You first, Ingra,"" he said.


 She reached in mechanically, her eyes intent on his, took out a slip
 and held it without opening it. The bowl went the rounds, till Svan
 himself took the last. All eyes were on him. No one had looked at their
 slips.


 Svan, too, had left his unopened. He sat at the table, facing them.
 ""This is the plan,"" he said. ""We will go, all six of us, in my ground
 car, to look at the Earth-ship. No one will suspect—the whole city
 has been to see it already. One will get out, at the best point we can
 find. It is almost dusk now. He can hide, surely, in the vegetation.
 The other five will start back. Something will go wrong with the
 car—perhaps it will run off the road, start to sink in the swamp. The
 guards will be called. There will be commotion—that is easy enough,
 after all; a hysterical woman, a few screams, that's all there is to
 it. And the sixth person will have his chance to steal to the side
 of the ship. The bomb is magnetic. It will not be noticed in the
 dark—they will take off before sunrise, because they must travel away
 from the sun to return—in forty hours the danger is removed.""


 There was comprehension in their eyes, Svan saw ... but still that
 uncertainty. Impatiently, he crackled: ""Look at the slips!""


 Though he had willed his eyes away from it, his fingers had rebelled.
 Instinctively they had opened the slip, turned it over and over,
 striving to detect if it was the fatal one. They had felt nothing....


 And his eyes saw nothing. The slip was blank. He gave it but a second's
 glance, then looked up to see who had won the lethal game of chance.
 Almost he was disappointed.


 Each of the others had looked in that same second. And each was looking
 up now, around at his neighbors. Svan waited impatiently for the chosen
 one to announce it—a second, ten seconds....


 Then gray understanding came to him.
A traitor!
his subconscious
 whispered.
A coward!
He stared at them in a new light, saw their
 indecision magnified, became opposition.


 Svan thought faster than ever before in his life. If there was a
 coward, it would do no good to unmask him. All were wavering, any might
 be the one who had drawn the fatal slip. He could insist on inspecting
 every one, but—suppose the coward, cornered, fought back? In fractions
 of a second, Svan had considered the evidence and reached his decision.
 Masked by the table, his hand, still holding the pencil, moved swiftly
 beneath the table, marked his own slip.


 In the palm of his hand, Svan held up the slip he had just marked in
 secret. His voice was very tired as he said, ""I will plant the bomb.""
The six conspirators in Svan's old ground car moved slowly along the
 main street of the native town. Two Earth-ship sailors, unarmed except
 for deceptively flimsy-looking pistols at their hips, stood before the
 entrance to the town's Hall of Justice.


 ""Good,"" said Svan, observing them. ""The delegation is still here. We
 have ample time.""


 He half turned in the broad front seat next to the driver, searching
 the faces of the others in the car. Which was the coward? he wondered.
 Ingra? Her aunt? One of the men?


 The right answer leaped up at him.
They all are
, he thought.
Not one
 of them understands what this means. They're afraid.
He clamped his lips. ""Go faster, Ingra,"" he ordered the girl who was
 driving. ""Let's get this done with.""


 She looked at him, and he was surprised to find compassion in her
 eyes. Silently she nodded, advanced the fuel-handle so that the clumsy
 car jolted a trace more rapidly over the corduroy road. It was quite
 dark now. The car's driving light flared yellowishly in front of them,
 illuminating the narrow road and the pale, distorted vegetation of the
 jungle that surrounded them. Svan noticed it was raining a little. The
 present shower would deepen and intensify until midnight, then fall off
 again, to halt before morning. But before then they would be done.


 A proton-bolt lanced across the road in front of them. In the silence
 that followed its thunderous crash, a man's voice bellowed: ""Halt!""


 The girl, Ingra, gasped something indistinguishable, slammed on the
 brakes. A Venusian in the trappings of the State Guard advanced on them
 from the side of the road, proton-rifle held ready to fire again.


 ""Where are you going?"" he growled.


 Svan spoke up. ""We want to look at the Earth-ship,"" he said. He opened
 the door beside him and stepped out, careless of the drizzle. ""We heard
 it was leaving tonight,"" he continued, ""and we have not seen it. Is
 that not permitted?""


 The guard shook his head sourly. ""No one is allowed near the ship. The
 order was just issued. It is thought there is danger.""


 Svan stepped closer, his teeth bared in what passed for a smile. ""It
 is urgent,"" he purred. His right hand flashed across his chest in a
 complicated gesture. ""Do you understand?""


 Confusion furrowed the guard's hairless brows, then was replaced by
 a sudden flare of understanding—and fear. ""The Council!"" he roared.
 ""By heaven, yes, I understand! You are the swine that caused this—""
 He strove instinctively to bring the clumsy rifle up, but Svan was
 faster. His gamble had failed; there was only one course remaining.
 He hurled his gross white bulk at the guard, bowled him over against
 the splintery logs of the road. The proton-rifle went flying, and Svan
 savagely tore at the throat of the guard. Knees, elbows and claw-like
 nails—Svan battered at the astonished man with every ounce of strength
 in his body. The guard was as big as Svan, but Svan had the initial
 advantage ... and it was only a matter of seconds before the guard
 lay unconscious, his skull a mass of gore at the back where Svan had
 ruthlessly pounded it against the road.
Svan grunted as his fingers constricted brutally.
Svan rose, panting, stared around. No one else was in sight, save the
 petrified five and the ground car. Svan glared at them contemptuously,
 then reached down and heaved on the senseless body of the guard. Over
 the shoulder of the road the body went, onto the damp swampland of the
 jungle. Even while Svan watched the body began to sink. There would be
 no trace.


 Svan strode back to the car. ""Hurry up,"" he gasped to the girl. ""Now
 there is danger for all of us, if they discover he is missing. And keep
 a watch for other guards.""
Venus has no moon, and no star can shine through its vast cloud layer.
 Ensign Lowry, staring anxiously out through the astro-dome in the bow
 of the Earth-ship, cursed the blackness.


 ""Can't see a thing,"" he complained to the Exec, steadily writing away
 at the computer's table. ""Look—are those lights over there?""


 The Exec looked up wearily. He shrugged. ""Probably the guards. Of
 course, you can't tell. Might be a raiding party.""


 Lowry, stung, looked to see if the Exec was smiling, but found no
 answer in his stolid face. ""Don't joke about it,"" he said. ""Suppose
 something happens to the delegation?""


 ""Then we're in the soup,"" the Exec said philosophically. ""I told you
 the natives were dangerous. Spy-rays! They've been prohibited for the
 last three hundred years.""


 ""It isn't all the natives,"" Lowry said. ""Look how they've doubled the
 guard around us. The administration is co-operating every way they
 know how. You heard the delegation's report on the intercom. It's this
 secret group they call the Council.""


 ""And how do you know the guards themselves don't belong to it?"" the
 Exec retorted. ""They're all the same to me.... Look, your light's gone
 out now. Must have been the guard. They're on the wrong side to be
 coming from the town, anyhow....""
Svan hesitated only a fraction of a second after the girl turned the
 lights out and stopped the car. Then he reached in the compartment
 under the seat. If he took a little longer than seemed necessary to get
 the atomite bomb out of the compartment, none of the others noticed.
 Certainly it did not occur to them that there had been
two
bombs in
 the compartment, though Svan's hand emerged with only one.


 He got out of the car, holding the sphere. ""This will do for me,"" he
 said. ""They won't be expecting anyone to come from behind the ship—we
 were wise to circle around. Now, you know what you must do?""


 Ingra nodded, while the others remained mute. ""We must circle back
 again,"" she parroted. ""We are to wait five minutes, then drive the car
 into the swamp. We will create a commotion, attract the guards.""


 Svan, listening, thought:
It's not much of a plan. The guards would
 not be drawn away. I am glad I can't trust these five any more. If
 they must be destroyed, it is good that their destruction will serve a
 purpose.
Aloud, he said, ""You understand. If I get through, I will return to the
 city on foot. No one will suspect anything if I am not caught, because
 the bomb will not explode until the ship is far out in space. Remember,
 you are in no danger from the guards.""
From the guards
, his mind echoed. He smiled. At least, they would
 feel no pain, never know what happened. With the amount of atomite in
 that bomb in the compartment, they would merely be obliterated in a
 ground-shaking crash.


 Abruptly he swallowed, reminded of the bomb that was silently counting
 off the seconds. ""Go ahead,"" he ordered. ""I will wait here.""


 ""Svan."" The girl, Ingra, leaned over to him. Impulsively she reached
 for him, kissed him. ""Good luck to you, Svan,"" she said.


 ""Good luck,"" repeated the others. Then silently the electric motor of
 the car took hold. Skilfully the girl backed it up, turned it around,
 sent it lumbering back down the road. Only after she had traveled a few
 hundred feet by the feel of the road did she turn the lights on again.


 Svan looked after them. The kiss had surprised him. What did it mean?
 Was it an error that the girl should die with the others?


 There was an instant of doubt in his steel-shackled mind, then it was
 driven away. Perhaps she was loyal, yet certainly she was weak. And
 since he could not know which was the one who had received the marked
 slip, and feared to admit it, it was better they all should die.


 He advanced along the midnight road to where the ground rose and the
 jungle plants thinned out. Ahead, on an elevation, were the rain-dimmed
 lights of the Earth-ship, set down in the center of a clearing made by
 its own fierce rockets. Svan's mist-trained eyes spotted the circling
 figures of sentries, and knew that these would be the ship's own.
 They would not be as easily overcome as the natives, not with those
 slim-shafted blasters they carried. Only deceit could get him to the
 side of the ship.


 Svan settled himself at the side of the road, waiting for his chance.
 He had perhaps three minutes to wait; he reckoned. His fingers went
 absently to the pouch in his wide belt, closed on the slip of paper. He
 turned it over without looking at it, wondering who had drawn the first
 cross, and been a coward. Ingra? One of the men?
He became abruptly conscious of a commotion behind him. A ground car
 was racing along the road. He spun around and was caught in the glare
 of its blinding driving-light, as it bumped to a slithering stop.


 Paralyzed, he heard the girl's voice. ""Svan! They're coming! They found
 the guard's rifle, and they're looking for us! Thirty Earthmen, Svan,
 with those frightful guns. They fired at us, but we got away and came
 for you. We must flee!""


 He stared unseeingly at the light. ""Go away!"" he croaked unbelievingly.
 Then his muscles jerked into action. The time was almost up—the bomb
 in the car—


 ""Go away!"" he shrieked, and turned to run. His fists clenched and
 swinging at his side, he made a dozen floundering steps before
 something immense pounded at him from behind. He felt himself lifted
 from the road, sailing, swooping, dropping with annihilating force
 onto the hard, charred earth of the clearing. Only then did he hear the
 sound of the explosion, and as the immense echoes died away he began to
 feel the pain seeping into him from his hideously racked body....


 The Flight Surgeon rose from beside him. ""He's still alive,"" he said
 callously to Lowry, who had just come up. ""It won't last long, though.
 What've you got there?""


 Lowry, a bewildered expression on his beardless face, held out the two
 halves of a metallic sphere. Dangling ends of wires showed where a
 connection had been broken. ""He had a bomb,"" he said. ""A magnetic-type,
 delayed-action atomite bomb. There must have been another in the car,
 and it went off. They—they were planning to bomb us.""


 ""Amazing,"" the surgeon said dryly. ""Well, they won't do any bombing
 now.""


 Lowry was staring at the huddled, mutilated form of Svan. He shuddered.
 The surgeon, seeing the shudder, grasped his shoulder.


 ""Better them than us,"" he said. ""It's poetic justice if I ever saw it.
 They had it coming...."" He paused thoughtfully, staring at a piece of
 paper between his fingers. ""This is the only part I don't get,"" he said.


 ""What's that?"" Lowry craned his neck. ""A piece of paper with a cross on
 it? What about it?""


 The surgeon shrugged. ""He had it clenched in his hand,"" he said. ""Had
 the devil of a time getting it loose from him."" He turned it over
 slowly, displayed the other side. ""Now what in the world would he be
 doing carrying a scrap of paper with a cross marked on both sides?""

There should be an epitaph for every

 man, big or little, but a really grand

 and special one for Loner Charlie.

Charles turned over on his side to look at her. She lay quietly in the
 other bed, the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. She was blonde to
 perfection, exquisitely shaped, and the rich promise of her body was
 exposed to his view.


 ""Why?"" he thought as he looked at her. ""Why did it have to happen like
 this?""


 The whole thing was still like a dream to him, and as yet he couldn't
 decide whether it was a good or a bad dream. A year ago she had been
 unattainable, a face to conjure with in erotic dreams, far beyond his
 ken. A year ago she had been a public idol, the most popular actress of
 the day. And he had been a nobody, full of a nobody's idle hopes and
 schemes.


 And now he was lying in the bed next to hers in her swank Manhattan
 apartment in the most exclusive hotel in town. The unrealness of the
 situation overwhelmed him. His mind was a picture of confused thoughts.
 Meanings and answers to his questions slithered out of his reach.


 ""God,"" he said. It was not an exclamation, nor yet an expletive. It was
 a mere statement of fact.


 A thought teased at him. Charles looked at the woman again and decided
 that she still looked beautiful in spite of the harshness of the
 room's lighting. He touched buttons by the edge of the bed and the
 illumination quieted to a soft glow, wrapping her in a radiant halo.
 Charles smiled wanly and got up. He stood by the bed looking at her.


 ""I could have fallen in love with you once. A year ago, perhaps, or
 longer. But not now. Not now."" He turned away and walked to the window.
 ""Now the world is dead. The whole world is dead.""


 New York lay quietly below him. It was the hour of indecision when
 day has not quite made up its mind to leave and night has not yet
 attacked in force. The streetlights were already on, making geometric
 patterns through the dusk of Central Park. Some of the billboards were
 shining, their relays activated by darkness-sensitized solenoids. A
 reddish-orange pallor hung from the sky.


 It had been very pleasant that afternoon. She had given of herself
 freely, warmly, and Charles had accepted. But then he had known
 that she would. It was not him, it was the circumstances. Under the
 circumstances, she would have given herself to any man—


 ""Why did it have to be her—or me? Why should it have to happen to
 anybody! Why!""
She would have given herself to any man—
His thoughts beat a rapid crescendo, activating emotions, stimulating
 sensations of angry rage. He wanted to cry, to weep angry tears of
 protest.


 To any man, WHO HAPPENED TO BE THE LAST MAN ON EARTH!


 Charles picked up a heavy book end off the table and crashed it through
 the thick pane of window glass.


 A gust of wind from the outside breezed through the shattered opening,
 attacking his olfactory patch with the retching smell of decaying
 flesh. Charles ignored it. Even smells had lost their customary
 meanings.


 He felt the rage build up inside again, tearing at his viscera. His
 stomach clenched up like an angry fist.


 ""But I don't want to be the last man alive!"" he shouted. ""I don't know
 what to do! I don't know where to go, how to act! I just don't know—""


 A paroxysm of sobbing shook his body. Trembling, he dropped to his
 knees, his head against the cold firmness of the sill, his hands
 clutched tightly around the jagged edges of the window pane. In spite
 of the sharp pain that raced through his system, in spite of the
 bright, warm, red stream that trickled down his face, he knelt by the
 window for several minutes.


 ""
Maybe I'm not the last!
""


 The thought struck him with suddenness, promisingly, edged with
 swelling comfort to fill his emptiness.


 Charles got up slowly, noticing for the first time that his fingers
 were badly cut. He wrapped a handkerchief around them and forgot them.
 He had to know—he had to find out.
As he turned to leave, he noticed again the woman lying in radiant
 state upon the bed. He walked to her side and leaned over, kissing her
 gently on the forehead. As he straightened up, his leg caught against
 her arm, pushing it slightly. The woman's arm slipped from its position
 and dangled from the edge of the bed like a crazy pendulum. Charles
 picked it up and folded it across her now cold breasts. He started
 to pull the sheet over her nude form, then stopped, smiling at his
 conventionality. After all, it didn't make any difference now.


 The phonograph was near the door. On sudden impulse he switched it
 on, turned the volume up full, and in grim jest left it playing
 Rachmaninoff's
Isle of the Dead
on full automatic. The music haunted
 him down the hall to the elevator that he had to run himself.


 The lobby was littered with debris, human and otherwise. Charles
 ignored it. The street that led towards the Bureau of Vital Statistics
 was a mess of desolate carnage. Charles overlooked it. Shop fronts
 smashed, stores looted, gyro-cars wrecked, proud buildings defaced.


 ""That was it,"" he said to himself. ""Pride. We called this the 'Proud
 Era.' Everything was better and bigger and nicer to have. Buildings
 were taller, men were healthier, most of the problems of humanity
 seemed licked, or nearly so. It was a time of free power, each small
 unit of population, each section of town operating on perpetual,
 ever-lasting, automatic atomic piles.


 ""We were free. We seemed, almost, to have accomplished something. The
 world was running well. No wonder we called it the 'Proud Era.' Life
 was fun, just a bowl of cherries, until....""


 Two years ago the animals had started dying. Strangely enough the
 rats had gone first, to anybody's notice. Sales of poison dropped,
 scientific laboratories chained to a perpetual rodent-cycle began to
 complain bitterly.


 Then the lovers who hunted out and haunted the lonely lanes through the
 countryside began to remark that the locusts were late that year. The
 Southern states joyously reported that mosquito control was working to
 an unprecedented degree. The largest cotton crop ever was forecast and
 rumors from Mexico had it that no one had died from scorpion bite in
 several weeks.


 A month later the meat animals, the birds and the household pets
 began dropping as rapidly as the flies which had dropped earlier.
 Congress was called into special session, as were all of the national
 governments around the world. The U.N. met at emergency sessions to
 cope with the situation. The president of the world-wide Society for
 the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals committed suicide.


 Within a year it was obvious to everyone that man was the only animal
 left on earth.


 The panic which had begun with the death of the animals was quieted
 somewhat by the fact that humans seemed immune to the pandemic. But the
 lakes full of dead fish caused a great stink and residents along the
 coasts began to move inland. Sales of perfumes and deodorants soared.


 Then just one year ago, the first human became infected with the
 strange malady. Within six months, half of the world's population was
 gone. Less than a month ago no more than a few thousand people remained
 in New York. And now....


 ""I've got to find out,"" Charles told himself. He meant it, of course,
 but in a sense he was afraid—afraid that his trip to the Bureau might
 give him an answer he didn't dare listen to. ""But I've got to try."" He
 walked on down the bloody street.


 Before the plague the Bureau of Vital Statistics had been one of man's
 crowning achievements. Housed as it was in a huge metallic globe of
 a building, it contained computers which kept exact account of every
 human on earth.


 Compulsory registration and the classification of each individual by
 means of the discrete patterns of his brain waves had accomplished for
 man what no ordinary census could have. The machine knew who was alive,
 who was dead, and where everybody was.


 Once a year the Bureau issued The Index, an exact accounting of Earth's
 four billion inhabitants. Four billion names and addresses, compressed
 into microprint, a tremendous achievement even for the ""Proud Era.""
 In all of his life, Charles had never once glanced at The Index.
 The average person had little necessity to do so since the Bureau
 information service would answer questions free of charge at any time.


 Reaching the gigantic building, Charles pushed aside the body of a
 young man and walked into the main foyer. Passing behind once-guarded
 doors, he entered the giant computer room and paused in admiration.
Only once, before the plague, had he seen the interior of this room.
 But he still remembered it and he still recalled the powerful emotional
 experience it had been those many years ago.


 All children had to have a brain-wave recording made by the Bureau
 during the first month of their life. And again at the age of 10 each
 child returned to the Bureau for a recheck. It was for this latter
 recording that Charles had come to the Bureau some twenty-two years
 before and a friendly guard had let him peep briefly into the computer
 room. The impression of intense activity, of organized confusion, of
 mechanical wonder had remained with him the rest of his life.


 ""So different now,"" he thought, surveying the room. ""Now it's empty, so
 empty."" The machine seemed to reflect the stillness, the very deadness
 of the world. The silence became unbearable.


 Charles walked to the master control panel. With newly acquired
 dexterity he switched the computer screens on and watched them glow
 to life. All around the world sensitive receiving stations pulsed to
 activity, sending out searching fingers, hunting for elusive patterns
 of neutral energy, mapping and tabulating the results.


 The main computer screen dominated one wall of the room. Other smaller
 screens clustered around it. On these screens could be graphed the
 population of any and every part of the globe. An illuminated counter
 immediately above it would give the numerical strength of the area
 being sampled while the screen would show population density by
 individual pinpoints of light that merged to form brightness patterns.


 ""I'll try New York first,"" he said to himself, knowing that he was a
 coward, afraid to check the whole world from the start. ""I'll start
 with New York and work up.""


 Charles activated the switches that would flash a schematic map of New
 York on the screen. ""There's bound to be somebody else left here. After
 all, there were at least twenty of us just a couple of days ago."" And
 one of them, a beautiful woman, had invited him up to her apartment,
 not because she liked him, but because....


 The main screen focused itself, the patterns shifting into a
 recognizable perceptual image.


 ""Why, it was just yesterday (or was it the day before?) that ten of
 us, at least, met here to check the figures. There were lots of us
 alive then."" Including the blond young woman who had died just this
 afternoon....


 Charles stopped talking and forced his eyes upwards. Peripheral vision
 caught first the vague outlines of the lower part of the map. His eyes
 continued to move, slowly, reluctantly. They caught the over-all relief
 of Greater New York City—and then concentrated on the single, shining
 dot at the very heart of the map—and he understood.


 His eyes stabbed quickly for the counter above the screen.


 One.


 He gasped.


 The counter read
one
.


 Charles was by himself, the last person alive in all of New York City.


 He began to tremble violently. The silence of the room began to press
 quickly in on him. His frantic fingers searched for the computer
 controls.


 New York State. One.


 The entire United States. One.


 The western hemisphere, including islands.


 (Was that a point of light in Brazil? No. Just a ghost image).


 One.


 The Pacific area, Asia, Australia, Asia Minor, Russia and the Near
 East, Africa and then Europe.


 England!


 There was a light in England! Someone else still lived! The counter
 clicked forward.


 Two!


 His trembling stopped. He breathed again.


 ""Of course. London was at least as populous as New York City before the
 plague. It's only logical that—""


 He stopped. For even as he spoke, the light winked out! The counter
 clicked again.


 One.


 Alone.


 Alone!


 Charles screamed.


 The bottom dropped out from under him!
Why?


 Such a simple question, but in those three letters lay the essence of
 human nature. Why. The drive of curiosity. Stronger, in a way, than
 the so-called ""basic"" drives: hunger, thirst, sex, shelter, warmth,
 companionship, elimination. Certainly more decisive in the history of
 the race. Man began to think, to differentiate himself from the other
 animals, when he first asked the question: ""Why?""


 But thinking about ""why"" didn't answer the question itself, Charles
 thought. He looked around him. He was sitting on a bench in Central
 Park, alone except for a few stray corpses. But the park was fairly
 free of bodies.


 ""You've got about ten minutes warning,"" he said to himself. ""I guess
 that most people wanted to die inside of something—inside of anything.
 Not out in the unprotected open.""


 The silence was like a weight hanging around his neck. Not an insect
 noise, not the chirp of a bird, not the sound of a car nor the scream
 of a plane. Not even a breeze to whisper among the leaves, he thought.
 Civilization equals life equals noise. Silence equals....


 Why. His mind kept returning to the question. Of all the people on
 earth, me. The last. Why me?


 Average, that's what he was. Height: 5'11"". Weight: 165. Age: 32.
 Status: Married, once upon a time.


 The Norm, with no significant departures, all down the line. Church
 member, but not a good one. Could that be it? Could the most normal be
 the most perfect? Had he led the best of all possible lives? Was that
 it? Had God, in His infinite wisdom and mercy, spared his life, saved
 him, singled him out because he was most nearly a saint, most nearly
 Christ-like, most nearly....


 Lies—His mind snapped back to reality. He half smiled. Saint? Christ?
 The Second Coming?


 He was no saint.


 Charles sighed.


 What about—?
Chance. That was it! The laws of probability, the bell-shaped curve,
 normal distribution, rectilinear regression. More people per square
 foot in New York than elsewhere. The first person who died was from New
 York, so the last person who gave way to the disease should come from
 here too. Spin the wheel; throw the dice; toss the coin.


 So simple to explain by the laws of chance. No need for any underlying
 assumptions about good and evil, no need for teleological arguments
 concerning cause and effect. Simply explain it by chance. Somebody had
 to be the last to go and that was—


 ""No,"" Charles said, standing up in the quiet of the spring evening.
 ""No, chance won't do it. No man can reckon with chance. The mind
 rejects such things. There must be something beyond mere accident.
 There must be!""


 He sighed slowly.


 ""So now I'm a hermit, whether or not I like it,"" he said in derision to
 the gravel path as he walked along it. ""A hermit in the midst of a city
 of millions of—No, I forgot. There aren't any more people, are there?""
 It was hard to realize, even now. ""A hermit, alone—and I haven't even
 got a cave....""


 Charles stopped walking suddenly. No cave, he thought. No place to
 sleep out the long one, no place to rest while time came to change
 things around and make them for the better. No place to hide.


 And suddenly it was the most important thing in life to him to find his
 ""cave.""


 It took him almost an hour to find the proper tools, and better than
 two hours more of hard, nighttime work to get the hole dug to his
 satisfaction. It took almost three hours to find the right sort of
 casket, durable but not too heavy for one man to handle. He carted it
 out to a grassy plot close to the center of the park where the grave
 was. He let the coffin down slowly into the depression, then piled up
 loose dirt on the sloping sides of the hole so that the rain would wash
 it down over him.


 ""I can't very well bury myself,"" he said. ""I guess it will rain after
 I'm gone."" He looked carefully down at the metallic container.


 Wait now. There was something wrong, something missing. It was—oh,
 yes, he caught it. It was the stone. There wasn't any stone to go at
 the head of the grave. ""I'll have to fix that.""


 A sheet of metal, bent double, served for the monument proper. A nearby
 tool shed yielded up a can of paint and a brush. By the glow of one of
 the streetlights Charles worked out the inscription.


 ""It ought to be something impressive,"" he thought out loud. ""Something
 fitting the occasion.""


 What did one say on these situations? There was so little chance to
 practice up for things like this. But it ought to be good, it ought to
 be proper.


 ""'In this now hallowed corner of the planet Earth—' No. That sounds
 too ... too....""


 Make it simple, he thought. And he finally wrote:
HERE LIES THE BODY OF

 THE LAST MAN ON EARTH


 Yes. That was it. Simple. Let whoever came afterwards figure out the
 rest. Let them decide. He smiled and finished the painting.


 Charles was hungry. He got up and started for one of the restaurants
 near the park. Later on, when there was more time, he'd find a piece
 of granite and move it to the plot. He could spend his free time
 carving on it, copying the inscription. He would make it into a real
 shrine; maybe he would practice up a bit and try to carve a statue to
 go with the stone.


 Somehow, though, since things were ready and it didn't make too much
 difference, it seemed to Charles that he'd probably have a long time
 to wait. ""Maybe it's just a disease, and I'm immune. I was immune to
 smallpox. The vaccination never took. That's probably it.""


 He smiled. Strange, but now he wanted very much to go on living,
 alone or not. There were things he could do, ways to keep occupied.
 He wouldn't mind it so much. But he wanted more and more desperately
 with each passing second to retain his foothold on the tenuous path of
 physical existence.


 The tantalizing thought of ""why"" puzzled its way back into his mind.
 But it seemed less pressing now that he had almost come to the
 conclusion that he would live for a long time. Later, in a few days
 perhaps, he would think about it. In a little while he'd have plenty of
 opportunity for hunting down the answer. This seemed good to him, for
 now he thought he almost had the answer, if there were an answer. He
 thought he had seen the solution peering out at him from the recesses
 of his mind, and he didn't like the expression on its face. Better to
 forget.
Charles reached the broad boulevard. There was a large cafe just across
 from him, its front window caved in by a large truck. He stumbled and
 almost fell as he stepped from the curb.


 ""Look at me, nervous as a cat.""


 He was trembling noticeably as he started across the street.


 ""I—"" He started to say something, to think something. But some hidden
 part of his mind clamped down, obscuring the thought, rejecting the
 concept.


 The tremor turned to a shake before he reached the far curb, and the
 first burst of wild pain came as he laid his shoulder against the door
 to the restaurant. This was the way the plague began, but—His mind
 quickly repressed the idea. It couldn't be the plague. He was immune!


 Another burst of pulsating, shattering pain crashed through his body,
 tearing down the defenses of his mind, putting an end of his thoughts
 of immunity. Colors flared before his eyes, a persistent, irresistible
 susurrus flooded his ears.


 He wanted to protest, but there was no one to listen to him. He
 appealed to every divinity he knew, all the time knowing it would be
 useless. His body, out of his voluntary control, tried to run off in
 all directions at once.


 Charles struggled to end his body's disorganized responses, to
 channelize all his energy into one direction. His mind came back into
 action. He set up his goal; everything else seemed irrelevant: he had
 to get back to the park, to his hermit's cave, to his long, narrow
 home. He couldn't die until then.


 Ten minutes.


 He was allotted ten minutes before the end.


 It could have been ten years or ten seconds, for now objective time
 meant nothing to him. It was not a matter of measuring seconds and
 minutes. It was a matter of forgetting time and measuring space.


 He concentrated on the grave; he forced his body to become an unwilling
 machine. While he could, he walked, forcing himself on. When his legs
 gave way, he crawled. When his knees buckled, he rolled. When his
 stomach protested, he vomited. It made no difference.


 Charles refused to think. Machines, especially half-broken machines, do
 not think; they only work. Sweating, straining, bleeding, retching, he
 pushed himself towards his goal, trying to add one final touch of grace
 and custom to the rude irrationalness of it all.


 His eyes gave out a few feet from the pit. He felt his way towards it.
 Convulsions shook his body like a cat shakes a captive mouse. He humped
 his body forward between the seizures, hands outstretched, searching
 for the grave.


 And then he was upon it. One arm reached out for grass, and clutched
 bare space instead.


 He was home.


 He gathered energy from his final reservoirs of strength for one final
 movement that would throw him headlong into the shallow grave. He
 tensed his muscles, pulled his limbs up under him and started to roll
 into the hole.


 Instantly the thought struck him with paralyzing devastation. The
 answer to it all poked its face out from the recesses of his mind and
 sapped the last bit of his energy, corroding his nerves and dying
 muscles. Now he knew, and the knowing was the end of it.


 He collapsed at the edge of the pit. Only one arm hung loosely down
 into it, swinging senseless in the air, pointing accusingly at the
 empty coffin.


 The world will end, not with a bang, nor with a whimper, but with the
 last man's anguished cry at the unreasonableness of it all.


 Charles screamed.
The large, invisible, ovular being that hung suspended over the Empire
 State Building rested from its exertion. Soon it was approached by
 another of its kind.


 ""It is finished?"" asked the second.


 ""Yes. Just now. I am resting.""


 ""I can feel the emptiness of it.""


 ""It was very good. Where were you?""


 ""On the next planet out. No beauty to it at all; no system. How was
 yours?""

 The first being moved imperceptably and the heavy plastoid binding of
 the book disappeared. The thousands of pages dropped softly, caught
 at the wind like hungry sails, separated, and pulled by the fingers of
 gravity, went their disparate ways.
Here a page scuttled into a broken window of the Chrysler Building
 (read the names: Aabat, Aabbs, Aabbt).


 Here a page landed upright on the head of one of the library lions
 and sloughed softly to the ground (read the names: Looman, Loomana,
 Loomanabsky).


 Here another page crept in between the cracks of a pier on the
 riverfront, dropping gently to the caressing eddies of the water (read
 the names: Smith, Smitha, Smitj).


 And here two pages danced down into Central Park, pirouetted,
 promenaded, and finally came to rest against a propped-up piece of
 metal (read the names: Whit, Whita, Whitacomb).


 It was not until the dusty morning sun stirred up the breezes that they
 fluttered down into the shallow hole beneath, unnoticed. The writing on
 the metal, until then partially obscured by the papers, became legible:
HERE LIES THE BODY OF

 THE LAST MAN ON EARTH—

 CHARLES J. ZZYZST

 GO TO HELL!

         No movie in the last decade has succeeded in psyching out critics and audiences as fully as the powerful, rambling war epic The Thin Red Line , Terrence Malick's return to cinema after 20 years. I've sat through it twice and am still trying to sort out my responses, which run from awe to mockery and back. Like Saving Private Ryan , the picture wallops you in the gut with brilliant, splattery battle montages and Goyaesque images of hell on earth. But Malick, a certified intellectual and the Pynchonesque figure who directed Badlands and Days                 of                 Heaven in the 1970s and then disappeared, is in a different philosophical universe from Steven Spielberg. Post-carnage, his sundry characters philosophize about their experiences in drowsy, runic voice-overs that come at you like slow bean balls: ""Why does nature vie with itself? ... Is there an avenging power in nature, not one power but two?"" Or ""This great evil: Where's it come from? What seed, what root did it grow from? Who's doin' this? Who's killin' us, robbin' us of life and light?"" First you get walloped with viscera, then you get beaned by blather. 

         Those existential speculations don't derive from the screenplay's source, an archetypal but otherwise down-to-earth 1962 novel by James Jones (who also wrote From Here to Eternity ) about the American invasion of the South Pacific island of Guadalcanal. They're central to Malick's vision of the story, however, and not specious. In the combat genre, the phrase ""war is hell"" usually means nothing more than that it's a bummer to lose a limb or two, or to see your buddy get his head blown off. A true work of art owes us more than literal horrors, and Malick obliges by making his theater of war the setting for nothing less than a meditation on the existence of God. 

         He tells the story solemnly, in three parts, with a big-deal cast (Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, John Cusack) and a few other major stars (John Travolta, Woody Harrelson, George Clooney) dropping by for cameos. After an Edenic prelude, in which a boyishly idealistic absent without leave soldier, Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel), swims with native youths to the accompaniment of a heavenly children's choir, the first part sees the arrival of the Allied forces on the island, introduces the principal characters (none of whom amounts to a genuine protagonist), and lays out the movie's geographical and philosophical terrain. The centerpiece--the fighting--goes on for over an hour and features the most frantic and harrowing sequences, chiefly the company's initially unsuccessful frontal assault on a Japanese hilltop bunker. The coda lasts nearly 40 minutes and is mostly talk and cleanup, the rhythms growing more relaxed until a final, incongruous spasm of violence--whereupon the surviving soldiers pack their gear and motor off to another South Pacific battle. In the final shot, a twisted tree grows on the waterline of the beach, the cycle of life beginning anew. 

                         The Thin Red Line has a curious sound-scape, as the noise of battle frequently recedes to make room for interior monologues and Hans Zimmer's bump-bump, minimalist New Age music. Pvt. Bell (Ben Chaplin) talks to his curvy, redheaded wife, viewed in deliriously sensual flashbacks. (""Love: Where does it come from? Who lit this flame in us?"") Lt. Col. Tall (Nolte), a borderline lunatic passed over one too many times for promotion and itching to win a battle no matter what the human cost, worries groggily about how his men perceive him. The dreamer Witt poses folksy questions about whether we're all a part of one big soul. If the movie has a spine, it's his off-and-on dialogue with Sgt. Welsh (Penn), who's increasingly irritated by the private's beatific, almost Billy Budd-like optimism. Says Welsh, ""In this world, a man himself is nothin', and there ain't no world but this one."" Replies Witt, high cheekbones glinting, ""I seen another world."" At first it seems as if Witt will indeed be Billy Budd to Welsh's vindictive Claggart. But if Witt is ultimately an ethereal martyr, Welsh turns out to be a Bogart-like romantic who can't stop feeling pain in the face of an absent God. He speaks the movie's epitaph, ""Darkness and light, strife and love: Are they the workings of one mind, the feature of the same face? O my soul, let me be in you now. Look out through my eyes. Look out at the things you made, all things shining."" 

         Malick puts a lot of shining things on the screen: soldiers, natives, parrots, bats, rodents, visions of Eden by way of National Geographic and of the Fall by way of Alpo. Malick's conception of consciousness distributes it among the animate and inanimate alike; almost every object is held up for rapturous contemplation. I could cite hundreds of images: A soldier in a rocking boat hovers over a letter he's writing, which is crammed from top to bottom and side to side with script. (You don't know the man, but you can feel in an instant his need to cram everything in.) A small, white-bearded Melanesian man strolls nonchalantly past a platoon of tensely trudging grunts who can't believe they're encountering this instead of a hail of Japanese bullets. Two shots bring down the first pair of soldiers to advance on the hill; a second later, the sun plays mystically over the tall, yellow grass that has swallowed their bodies. John Toll's camera rushes in on a captured Japanese garrison: One Japanese soldier shrieks; another, skeletal, laughs and laughs; a third weeps over a dying comrade. The face of a Japanese soldier encased in earth speaks from the dead, ""Are you righteous? Know that I was, too."" 

         Whether or not these pearllike epiphanies are strung is another matter. Malick throws out his overarching theme--is nature two-sided, at war with itself?--in the first few minutes but, for all his startling juxtapositions, he never dramatizes it with anything approaching the clarity of, say, Brian De Palma's Casualties of War (1989). Besides the dialogue between Welsh and Witt, The Thin Red Line 's other organizing story involves a wrenching tug of war between Nolte's ambition-crazed Tall and Capt. Staros (Elias Koteas), who refuses an order to send his men on what will surely be a suicidal--and futile--assault on a bunker. But matters of cause and effect don't really interest Malick. Individual acts of conscience can and do save lives, and heroism can win a war or a battle, he acknowledges. But Staros is ultimately sent packing, and Malick never bothers to trace the effect of his action on the Guadalcanal operation. In fact, the entire battle seems to take place in a crazed void. Tall quotes Homer's ""rosy-fingered dawn"" and orders a meaningless bombardment to ""buck the men up--it'll look like the Japs are catching hell."" Soldiers shoot at hazy figures, unsure whether they're Japanese or American. Men collide, blow themselves in half with their own mishandled grenades, stab themselves frantically with morphine needles, shove cigarettes up their noses to keep the stench of the dying and the dead at bay. A tiny bird, mortally wounded, flutters in the grass. 

         Malick is convincing--at times overwhelming--on the subject of chaos. It's when he tries to ruminate on order that he gets gummed up, retreating to one of his gaseous multiple mouthpieces: ""Where is it that we were together? Who is it that I lived with? Walked with? The brother. ... The friend. ... One mind."" I think I'd have an easier time with Malick's metaphysical speculations if I had a sense of some concomitant geopolitical ones--central to any larger musings on forces of nature as viewed through the prism of war. Couldn't it be that the German and Japanese fascist orders were profoundly anti-natural, and that the Allies' cause was part of a violent but natural correction? You don't have to buy into Spielberg's Lincolnesque pieties in Saving Private Ryan to believe that there's a difference between World War II and Vietnam (or, for that matter, World War II and the invasion of Grenada or our spats with Iraq). While he was at Harvard, Malick might have peeled himself off the lap of his pointy-headed mentor, Stanley Cavell, the philosopher and film theorist, and checked out a few of Michael Waltzer's lectures on just and unjust wars. Maybe then he'd view Guadalcanal not in an absurdist vacuum (the soldiers come, they kill and are killed, they leave) but in the larger context of a war that was among the most rational (in its aims, if not its methods) fought in the last several centuries. For all his visionary filmmaking, Malick's Zen neutrality sometimes seems like a cultivated--and pretentious--brand of fatuousness. 

         John Travolta's empty nightclub impersonation of Bill Clinton in Primary Colors (1998) had one positive result: It gave him a jump-start on Jan Schlichtmann, the reckless personal injury lawyer at the center of A Civil Action . Travolta's Schlichtmann is much more redolent of Clinton: slick and selfish and corrupt in lots of ways but basically on the side of the angels, too proud and arrogant to change tactics when all is certainly lost. Schlichtmann pursued--and more or less blew--a civil liability case against the corporate giants Beatrice and W.R. Grace over the allegedly carcinogenic water supply of Woburn, Mass. Boston writer Jonathan Harr, in the book the movie is based on, went beyond the poison in the Woburn wells to evoke (stopping just short of libel) the poison of the civil courts, where platoons of overpaid corporate lawyers can drive opponents with pockets less deep and psyches less stable into bankruptcy and hysteria. 

         Director Steven Zaillian's version doesn't capture the mounting rage that one experiences while reading Harr's book, or even the juicy legal machinations that Francis Ford Coppola giddily manipulated in his underrated adaptation of John Grisham's The Rainmaker (1997). But A Civil Action is a sturdy piece of work, an old-fashioned conversion narrative with some high-tech zip. Schlichtmann doesn't take this ""orphan"" case--brought by the parents of several children who died of leukemia--because he wants to do good but because he figures that Grace and Beatrice will fork over huge sums of money to keep the parents from testifying publicly about their children's last days. He might succeed, too, if it weren't for Jerome Facher (Robert Duvall), the Beatrice lawyer who knows how to keep Schlichtmann shadowboxing while his small firm's financial resources dwindle to nothing. 

         Zaillian is at his most assured when he cuts back and forth between Facher's Harvard Law School lectures on what not to do in court and Schlichtmann's fumbling prosecution. The sequence has the extra dimension of good journalism: It dramatizes and comments simultaneously. Plus, it gives Duvall a splendid platform for impish understatement. (Duvall has become more fun to watch than just about anyone in movies.) Elsewhere, Zaillian takes a more surface approach, sticking to legal minutiae and rarely digging for the deeper evil. As in his Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993), the outcome of every scene is predictable, but how Zaillian gets from beat to beat is surprisingly fresh. He also gets sterling bit performances from Sydney Pollack as the spookily sanguine Grace CEO, William H. Macy as Schlichtmann's rabbity accountant, and Kathleen Quinlan as the mother of one of the victims. Quinlan knows that when you're playing a woman who has lost a child you don't need to emote--you reveal the emotion by trying not to emote. 

         To the families involved in the Woburn tragedy, the real climax of this story isn't the downbeat ending of the book or the sleight of hand, ""let's call the Environmental Protection Agency,"" upbeat ending of the movie. The climax is the publication of a book that takes the plaintiffs' side and that remains on the best-seller list in hardcover and paperback for years. The climax is the movie starring John Travolta.

THE LITTLE RED BAG

About an hour out of San Francisco on the flight to Los Angeles, I made
 the discovery. I had finished reading the
Chronicle
, folded and put
 it beside me, turned and looked out the window, expecting to see the
 San Joaquin Valley but finding only a sea of clouds instead. So I
 returned my attention to the inside of the plane, to the overstuffed
 gray-haired woman asleep beside me, to the backs of heads in seats
 before me, across the aisle to other heads, and down to the blonde.


 I had seen her in the concourse and at the gate, a shapely thing. Now
 she had crossed her legs and I was privileged to view a trim ankle and
 calf, and her profile as she stared moodily across the aisle and out a
 window where there was nothing to see.


 I slid my eyes past her to others. A crossword-puzzle worker, a
 togetherness-type-magazine reader.


 Inventory completed, I went back to looking at the clouds, knowing I
 should be thinking about the printing order I was going to Los Angeles
 for, and not wanting to.


 So I started going through the purse of the woman next to me. Perhaps
 that sounds bad. It wasn't. I'd been doing it for years and nobody ever
 complained.


 It started when I was a kid, this business of being able to explore
 the insides of things like purses and sealed boxes and locked drawers
 and—well, human beings. But human beings aren't worth the trouble.
 It's like swimming through spaghetti. And I've got to stay away from
 electric wires. They hurt. Now don't ask me
how
they hurt.


 Maybe you think it's fun. For the most part, it really isn't. I always
 knew what was in Christmas presents before I unwrapped them, and
 therefore Christmas was always spoiled for me as a kid. I can't feel
 the color of anything, just its consistency. An apple senses about the
 same as a potato, except for the core and the stem. I can't even tell
 if there's writing on a piece of paper. So you see it isn't much. Just
 the feel of shapes, the hardnesses and softnesses. But I've learned to
 become pretty good at guessing.


 Like this woman next to me. She had a short, cylindrical metal object
 in her purse with waxlike stuff inside it—a lipstick. A round, hard
 object with dust inside—a compact. Handkerchief, chewing gum, a small
 book, probably an address book, money in a change purse—a few bills
 and coins. Not much else.


 I was a little disappointed. I've run across a gun or two in my time.
 But I never say anything.
I learned the wisdom of keeping my mouth shut in the fourth grade when
 Miss Winters, a stern, white-haired disciplinarian, ordered me to eat
 my sack lunch in the classroom with her instead of outside with some
 of the other kids. This was the punishment for some minor infraction.
 Lunchtime was nearly over and we'd both finished eating; she said she'd
 be gone for a few moments and that I was to erase the blackboard during
 her absence, which I dutifully did.


 Class had hardly resumed when she started looking around the desk for
 her favorite mechanical pencil, asking if any of us had seen it, and
 looking straight at me. I didn't want her to think I had taken it while
 she was out of the room, so I probed the contents of her purse, which
 she always kept in the upper right drawer of her desk.


 ""It's in your purse,"" I blurted out.


 I was sent home with a stinging note.


 Since then I've kept quiet. At one time I assumed everybody was able
 to sense. I've known better for years. Still, I wonder how many other
 people are as close-mouthed about their special gift as I am about mine.


 I used to think that some day I'd make a lot of money out of it, but
 how? I can't read thoughts. I can't even be sure what some of the
 things I sense in probing really are.


 But I've learned to move things. Ever so little. A piece of paper. A
 feather. Once I stopped one of those little glass-enclosed light or
 heat-powered devices with vanes you see now and then in a jeweler's
 window. And I can stop clocks.


 Take this morning, for example. I had set my alarm for five-thirty
 because I had to catch the seven o'clock plane at San Francisco
 International Airport. This being earlier than I usually get up, it
 seems all I did during the night was feel my way past the escapement
 and balance wheel to see where the notch for the alarm was. The last
 time I did it there was just the merest fraction of an inch between the
 pawl and the notch. So I sighed and moved to the balance wheel and its
 delicate ribbon of spiraling steel. I hung onto the wheel, exerting
 influence to decrease the restoring torque.


 The wheel slowed down until there was no more ticking. It took quite
 a bit of effort, as it always does, but I did it, as I usually do. I
 can't stand the alarm.


 When I first learned to do this, I thought I had it made. I even went
 to Las Vegas to try my hand, so to speak, with the ratchets and pawls
 and cams and springs on the slot machines. But there's nothing delicate
 about a slot machine, and the spring tensions are too strong. I dropped
 quite a lot of nickels before I finally gave up.


 So I'm stuck with a talent I've found little real use for. Except that
 it amuses me. Sometimes. Not like this time on the plane.


 The woman beside me stirred, sat up suddenly and looked across me out
 the window. ""Where are we?"" she asked in a surprised voice. I told her
 we were probably a little north of Bakersfield. She said, ""Oh,"" glanced
 at her wristwatch and sank back again.


 Soon the stewardesses would bring coffee and doughnuts around, so I
 contented myself with looking at the clouds and trying to think about
 Amos Magaffey, who was purchasing agent for a Los Angeles amusement
 chain, and how I was going to convince him our printing prices were
 maybe a little higher but the quality and service were better. My mind
 wandered below where I was sitting, idly moving from one piece of
 luggage to another, looking for my beat-up suitcase. I went through
 slips and slippers, lingerie and laundry, a jig saw puzzle and a
 ukulele.


 I never did find my suitcase because I found the bomb first.
The bomb was in a small bag—a woman's bag judging by the soft,
 flimsy things you'd never find in a man's—and I didn't know it was a
 bomb right away. I thought it was just a clock, one of those small,
 quiet alarms. I was going to pass it by and go on, but what held me
 was that something was taped to it. By the feel, I knew it must be
 electrician's tape. Interested and curious, I explored the clock more
 closely, found two wires. One went to a battery and the other to hard
 round cylinders taped together. The hairs stood up at the base of my
 neck when I suddenly realized what it was.


 The clock's balance wheel was rocking merrily. Quickly I went up past
 the train of gears to the alarm wheel. If this was anything like my own
 alarm clock, this one had something like ten minutes to go.


 It was forty minutes to Burbank and Lockheed Air Terminal.


 My mind was churning when I turned from the window to look around
 at the unconcerned passengers, the woman at my side asleep again. I
 thought: Which one of these.... No, none of them would know it was
 there. I glanced out the window again; clouds were still in the way.
 We'd be leaving the valley for the mountain range north of Los Angeles
 soon, if we hadn't left it already. No place to land the plane there.


 But of course that had been the plan!


 My heart was beating in jackhammer rhythm; my mouth was dry and my mind
 was numb. Tell somebody about the bomb before it's too late! No, they'd
 think I put it there. Besides, what good would it do? There would be
 panic and they'd never get the plane down in time—if they believed me.


 ""Sir."" My head jerked around. The stewardess stood in the aisle,
 smiling, extending a tray to me, a brown plastic tray bearing a small
 paper cup of tomato juice, a cup of coffee, a cellophane-wrapped
 doughnut, paper spoon, sugar and dehydrated cream envelopes, and a
 napkin.


 I goggled at her, managed to croak, ""No, thanks."" She gave me an odd
 look and moved along. My seatmate had accepted hers and was tearing at
 the cellophane. I couldn't bear to watch her.


 I closed my eyes, forced my mind back to the luggage compartment, spent
 a frantic moment before I found the bag again. I had to stop that
 balance wheel, just as I stopped my alarm clock every morning. I tried
 to close everything off—the throb of engines, the rush of air, the
 woman sipping coffee noisily beside me—and I went into the clock and
 surrounded the seesawing wheel. When it went forward, I pulled it back;
 when it went back, I pulled it forward. I struggled with it, and it was
 like trying to work with greasy hands, and I was afraid I wasn't going
 to be able to stop it.


 Then, little by little, it started to slow its beat. But I could not
 afford to relax. I pushed and pulled and didn't dare release my hold
 until it came to a dead stop.


 ""Anything the matter?""


 My eyelids flew open and I looked into the eyes of the woman next to
 me. There was sugar from the doughnut around her mouth and she was
 still chewing.


 ""No,"" I said, letting out my breath. ""I'm all right.""


 ""You were moaning, it sounded like. And you kept moving your head back
 and forth.""


 ""Must have been dreaming,"" I said as I rang for the stewardess. When
 she came I told her I'd take some of that coffee now. No, nothing else,
 just coffee. I didn't tell her how much I needed it. I sat there clammy
 with sweat until she returned. Coffee never tasted so good.
All right, so I had stopped the bomb's timer. My mind raced ahead to
 the landing. When they unloaded the luggage, the balance wheel would
 start again. I wouldn't be able to stay with it, keeping it still.
 I considered telling the authorities as soon as we landed, or maybe
 calling in ahead, but wouldn't that just bring suspicion, questions.
 Maybe I could convince them I could stop a clock—but not before the
 bomb exploded. And then what? My secret would be out and my life would
 be changed. I'd be a man not to be trusted, a prying man, a man
 literally with gimlet eyes.


 Mountain crags jutted through the clouds. We were in the range north of
 the city. Here and there were clear spots and I could see roads below,
 but there were also clouds far above us. It was very beautiful, but it
 was also very bumpy, and we started to slip and slide.


 To my horror I found that the balance wheel was rocking again. Closing
 my eyes and gritting my teeth, I forced my senses to the wheel, tugging
 and pulling and shoving and pushing until it finally stopped.


 A jab in the shoulder. I jumped, startled.


 ""Your cup,"" my seat partner said, pointing.


 I looked down at the coffee cup I had crushed in my hands. Then I
 looked up into the eyes of the stewardess. I handed it to her. She took
 it without a word and went away.


 ""Were you really asleep that time?""


 ""Not really,"" I said. I was tempted to tell the woman I was subject to
 fits, but I didn't.


 It was only a few minutes to landing, but they became the longest
 minutes of my life as time after time I stopped the rocking wheel when
 the plane dipped and bumped to a landing.


 Leaving the apron with the other passengers, I tried to walk as
 unconcernedly as they through the exit gate. I would have liked walking
 through the terminal and out the entrance and away, but I could not. I
 had my suitcase to get, for one thing. The damned bomb was the other.
 So I strolled out into the concourse again to look at the plane and
 watch the baggagemen at work, transferring the luggage to two airfield
 carts. They weren't as careful as I would have been.


 It was impossible to tell from this distance just which bag contained
 the bomb; I could hardly identify my own scarred suitcase. The
 assortment of bags—a strange conglomeration of sizes and colors—was
 packed in some places six deep, and it rolled toward the gate where
 I was standing. I didn't know whether to stay or run, imagining the
 balance wheel now happily rocking again. The load went past me down a
 ramp to the front of the air terminal where the luggage was unloaded
 and placed in a long rack. I went with it.


 There was a flurry of ticket matching, hands grabbing for suitcases,
 and a general exodus on the part of my fellow passengers, too fast to
 determine who had got the one with the bomb. Now all that was left was
 the attendant and I had two bags—my own battered veteran of years, and
 a fine new red overnight case, small enough to be the one.


 I lit a cigarette, reached out. Inside were a woman's things and—a
 clock. The escapement was clicking vigorously.


 I didn't moan this time. I just closed my eyes, stretched toward
 and grabbed the balance wheel I was getting to know like my own. I
 entered into a union with it so strong that after I had reduced it to
 immobility, it was like waking when I opened my eyes.
The baggage claim attendant was staring at me. For only a moment I
 stared back. Then I quickly reached for my baggage check and presented
 it to him. His hand hovered over the handle of the little red bag and I
 was ready to yell at him. But then, matching numbers on the tags with
 his eyes, his hand grasped the handle of my own suitcase and pushed it
 toward me.


 ""Thanks,"" I said, taking it. I glanced ever so casually toward the
 remaining bag. ""One left over, eh?""


 ""Yeah."" He was so bored I was tempted to tell him what was in it. But
 he was eying me with a ""well-why-don't-you-get-along?"" look.


 I said, ""What happens if nobody claims it?""


 ""Take it inside. Why?""


 He was getting too curious. ""Oh, I just wondered, that's all.""


 I stepped on my cigarette and walked toward the air terminal entrance
 and put my suitcase on the stone steps there. A redcap came hurrying
 over.


 ""Cab?""


 I shook my head. ""Just waiting.""


 Just waiting for somebody to pick up a bomb.


 I lit another cigarette and glanced now and then toward the baggage
 claim area. The red bag was still there. All sorts of theories ran
 through my head as to why it should still be there, and none satisfied
 me.


 I should not have been there, that much I knew; I should be with a
 man named Amos Magaffey on Sixth Street at ten o'clock, discussing
 something very mundane, the matter of a printing order. But what could
 I do? If I left the airport, the attendant would eventually take the
 bag inside and there would be an explosion, and I wouldn't be able to
 live with myself.


 No. I had to stay to keep the balance wheel stationary until—until
 what?


 A man in tan gabardine, wearing a police cap and badge, walked out of
 the entrance to stand on the stone steps beside me while he put on a
 pair of dark glasses. A member of the airport police detail. I could
 tell him. I could take him down to the little red bag and explain the
 whole thing. Then it would be his baby and I would be off on my own
 business.


 But he moved on down the steps, nodded at the redcap, and started
 across the street to the parking area. I could have called to him,
 ""Hey, officer, let me tell you about a bomb in a little red bag."" But
 I didn't. I didn't because I caught a movement at the baggage claim
 counter out of the side of my eye.


 The attendant had picked up the bag and was walking with it up the ramp
 to the rear of the air terminal. Picking up my own suitcase, I went
 inside in time to see him enter through a side door and deposit the bag
 on the scales at the airline desk and say something to the clerk. The
 clerk nodded and moved the bag to the rear room.


 I could visualize the balance wheel once again rocking like crazy. How
 many minutes—or seconds—were left? I was sweating when I moved to the
 counter, and it wasn't because of the sunshine I'd been soaking in. I
 had to get as close to the bag as I could if I was going to stop the
 clock again.


 ""Can I help you?"" the clerk asked.


 ""No. I'm waiting for someone.""


 I turned my back to him, put down my suitcase, leaned against the
 counter and reached out for the wheel. I found I could reach the
 device, but it was far away. When I tried to dampen it, the wheel
 escaped my grasp.


 ""Do you have my suitcase?""


 I blinked my eyes open and looked around. The blonde in the plane stood
 there looking very fresh and bright and unconcerned. In her right hand
 she had a green baggage claim check.


 The clerk took it, nodded, and in a moment brought out the overnight
 case and set it on the scales. The girl thanked him, picked it up,
 glanced at me indifferently, and then started for the entrance with it.


 ""Just a moment,"" I found myself saying, grabbing my bag and hurrying
 after her.
At her side and a little ahead of her, I said, ""Listen to me.""


 She looked annoyed and increased her stride toward the door.


 ""It's a matter of life or death,"" I said. I wanted to wrest the bag
 from her and hurl it out through the doorway into the street, but I
 restrained myself.


 She stopped and stared. I noticed a short, fat man in a rumpled
 suitcoat and unpressed pants staring, too. Ignoring him, I said,
 ""Please put the bag down. Over there."" I indicated a spot beside a
 telephone booth where it would be out of the way.


 She didn't move. She just said, ""Why?""


 ""For God's sake!"" I took the case. She offered no resistance. I put her
 bag and mine next to the booth. When I turned around she was standing
 there looking at me as if I had gone out of my mind. Her eyes were blue
 and brown-flecked, very pretty eyes, and my thought at the moment was,
 I'm glad the bomb didn't go off; these eyes wouldn't be looking at me
 or anything else right now if it had.


 ""I've got to talk to you. It's very important.""


 The girl said, ""Why?"" I was beginning to think it was the only word she
 knew. At the same time I was wondering why anyone would want to kill
 someone so lovely.


 ""I'll explain in a moment. Please stand right here while I make a
 telephone call."" I moved toward the phone booth, paused and said, ""And
 don't ask me why.""


 She gave me a speculative look.


 I must not have seemed a complete idiot because she said, ""All right,
 but—""


 I didn't listen for the rest. I went into the booth, closed the door,
 pretended to drop a coin and dial a number. But all the time I was in
 there, I was reaching out through the glass for the clock. At this
 range it wasn't difficult to stop the balance wheel.


 Just the same, when I came out I was wringing wet.


 ""Now will you please tell me what this is all about?"" she said stiffly.


 ""Gladly. Let me buy you a cup of coffee and I'll explain.""


 She glanced at the bags. I told her they'd be all right. We followed
 the short, fat man into the coffee shop.


 Over coffee I explained it all to her, how I had this extrasensory
 ability, how she was the first person I had ever revealed it to, and
 how I had discovered what was in her overnight bag.


 During the telling, her untouched coffee grew a skin, her face grew
 pale, her eyes grew less curious and more troubled. There were tears
 there when I finished. I asked her who put the bomb in her bag.


 ""Joe did,"" she said in a toneless voice, not looking at me any more but
 staring vacantly across the room. ""Joe put it there."" Behind her eyes
 she was reliving some recent scene.


 ""Who is Joe?""


 ""My husband."" I thought she was going to really bawl, but she got
 control again. ""This trip was his idea, my coming down here to visit my
 sister."" Her smile was bleak. ""I see now why he wanted to put in those
 books. I'd finished packing and was in the bathroom. He said he'd put
 in some books we'd both finished reading—for my sister. That's when he
 must have put the—put it in there.""


 I said gently, ""Why would he want to do a thing like that?""


 ""I don't know."" She shook her head. ""I just don't know."" And she was
 close to bawling again. Then she recovered and said, ""I'm not sure I
 want to know."" I admired her for saying it. Joe must have been crazy.


 ""It's all right now?"" she asked.


 I nodded. ""As long as we don't move it.""


 I told her I didn't know how much more time there was, that I'd been
 thinking it over and that the only way out seemed to be to tell the
 airport policeman. After I explained it to her, the girl—she said her
 name was Julia Claremont—agreed to tell him she thought there was a
 bomb in her bag, that she had noticed a ticking and had become worried
 because she knew she hadn't packed a clock. It wasn't good, but it
 would have to do.


 ""We've got to get it deactivated,"" I said, watching the fat man pay for
 his coffee and leave. ""The sooner the better.""
I finished my coffee in one gulp and went to pay the bill with her.
 I asked her why she didn't claim the bag at the same time the other
 people had. She said she had called her sister and the phone was busy
 for a long while.


 ""She was supposed to meet me, and when she wasn't here, I got worried.
 She said she isn't feeling well and asked me to take a cab."" She smiled
 a little. It was a bright, cheery thing. I had the feeling it was all
 for me. ""That's where I was going when you caught up with me.""


 It had become a very nice day. But the bottom dropped out of it again
 when we reached the lobby.


 The two bags weren't there.


 I ran to the entrance and nearly collided with the redcap.


 ""See anybody go out of here with a little red bag and an old battered
 suitcase?""


 ""Bag? Suitcase?"" he mumbled. Then he became excited. ""Why, a man just
 stepped out of here—"" He turned to look down the street. ""That's him.""


 The dumpy man I'd seen was walking off; Julia's bag in his right hand,
 mine in his left. He seemed in no hurry.


 ""Hey!"" I shouted, starting toward him.


 The man turned, took one look at me, and started to run. He came
 abreast an old gray, mud-spattered coupe, ran around, opened the door
 and threw both bags into the rear seat as he got in.


 The car was a hundred feet away and gathering speed by the time I
 reached where it had been parked. I watched it for a moment, then
 walked back to the entranceway where Julia was standing with the
 redcap, who said, ""That man steal them suitcases?""


 ""That he did,"" I said.


 Just then the airport policeman started across the street from the
 parking lot. Redcap said, ""Better tell him about it.""


 The policeman was sympathetic and concerned. He said, ""We'd better get
 over to the office.""


 But we never left the spot because an explosion some blocks distant
 shattered the air. Julia's hand grasped my arm. Hard.


 ""Jets,"" the redcap said, eying the sky.


 ""I don't know,"" the policeman said. ""Didn't sound much like a jet to
 me.""


 We stood there. I could visualize the wreckage of an old gray coupe
 in the middle of a street, but I couldn't visualize the driver. That
 was all right. I didn't want to see him. I didn't know what Julia was
 thinking.


 She said, ""About those bags,"" and looked at me.


 The officer said, ""Yes, miss?""


 ""I—I don't care about mine. I didn't have much of anything in it.""


 ""I feel the same way,"" I said. ""Would it be all right if we didn't
 bother to report it?""


 ""Well,"" the policeman said, ""I can't
make
you report it.""


 ""I'd rather not then,"" Julia said. She turned to me. ""I'd like some
 air. Can't we walk a little?""


 ""Sure,"" I said.


 We started down the street, her arm in mine, as the air began to fill
 with the distant sounds of sirens.

""Get Gunther,"" the official orders read. It

 was to laugh! For Click and Irish were

 marooned on the pirate's asteroid—their only

 weapons a single gun and a news-reel camera.


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Planet Stories Spring 1944.

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

Suddenly, it was there. There wasn't time to blink or speak or get
 scared. Click Hathaway's camera was loaded and he stood there listening
 to it rack-spin film between his fingers, and he knew he was getting a
 damned sweet picture of everything that was happening.


 The picture of Marnagan hunched huge over the control-console,
 wrenching levers, jamming studs with freckled fists. And out in the
 dark of the fore-part there was space and a star-sprinkling and this
 meteor coming like blazing fury.


 Click Hathaway felt the ship move under him like a sensitive animal's
 skin. And then the meteor hit. It made a spiked fist and knocked the
 rear-jets flat, and the ship spun like a cosmic merry-go-round.


 There was plenty of noise. Too damned much. Hathaway only knew he was
 picked up and hurled against a lever-bank, and that Marnagan wasn't
 long in following, swearing loud words. Click remembered hanging on to
 his camera and gritting to keep holding it. What a sweet shot that had
 been of the meteor! A sweeter one still of Marnagan beating hell out of
 the controls and keeping his words to himself until just now.


 It got quiet. It got so quiet you could almost hear the asteroids
 rushing up, cold, blue and hard. You could hear your heart kicking a
 tom-tom between your sick stomach and your empty lungs.


 Stars, asteroids revolved. Click grabbed Marnagan because he was the
 nearest thing, and held on. You came hunting for a space-raider and you
 ended up cradled in a slab-sized Irishman's arms, diving at a hunk of
 metal death. What a fade-out!


 ""Irish!"" he heard himself say. ""Is this IT?""


 ""Is this
what
?"" yelled Marnagan inside his helmet.


 ""Is this where the Big Producer yells CUT!?""


 Marnagan fumed. ""I'll die when I'm damned good and ready. And when I'm
 ready I'll inform you and you can picture me profile for Cosmic Films!""


 They both waited, thrust against the shipside and held by a hand of
 gravity; listening to each other's breathing hard in the earphones.


 The ship struck, once. Bouncing, it struck again. It turned end over
 and stopped. Hathaway felt himself grabbed; he and Marnagan rattled
 around—human dice in a croupier's cup. The shell of the ship burst,
 air and energy flung out.


 Hathaway screamed the air out of his lungs, but his brain was thinking
 quick crazy, unimportant things. The best scenes in life never reach
 film, or an audience. Like this one, dammit! Like
this
one! His
 brain spun, racketing like the instantaneous, flicking motions of his
 camera.
Silence came and engulfed all the noise, ate it up and swallowed it.
 Hathaway shook his head, instinctively grabbed at the camera locked
 to his mid-belt. There was nothing but stars, twisted wreckage, cold
 that pierced through his vac-suit, and silence. He wriggled out of the
 wreckage into that silence.


 He didn't know what he was doing until he found the camera in his
 fingers as if it had grown there when he was born. He stood there,
 thinking ""Well, I'll at least have a few good scenes on film. I'll—""


 A hunk of metal teetered, fell with a crash. Marnagan elevated seven
 feet of bellowing manhood from the wreck.


 ""Hold it!"" cracked Hathaway's high voice. Marnagan froze. The camera
 whirred. ""Low angle shot; Interplanetary Patrolman emerges unscathed
 from asteroid crackup. Swell stuff. I'll get a raise for this!""


 ""From the toe of me boot!"" snarled Marnagan brusquely. Oxen shoulders
 flexed inside his vac-suit. ""I might've died in there, and you nursin'
 that film-contraption!""


 Hathaway felt funny inside, suddenly. ""I never thought of that.
 Marnagan die? I just took it for granted you'd come through. You always
 have. Funny, but you don't think about dying. You try not to."" Hathaway
 stared at his gloved hand, but the gloving was so thick and heavy he
 couldn't tell if it was shaking. Muscles in his bony face went down,
 pale. ""Where are we?""


 ""A million miles from nobody.""


 They stood in the middle of a pocked, time-eroded meteor plain that
 stretched off, dipping down into silent indigo and a rash of stars.
 Overhead, the sun poised; black and stars all around it, making it look
 sick.


 ""If we walk in opposite directions, Click Hathaway, we'd be shaking
 hands the other side of this rock in two hours."" Marnagan shook his mop
 of dusty red hair. ""And I promised the boys at Luna Base this time I'd
 capture that Gunther lad!""


 His voice stopped and the silence spoke.


 Hathaway felt his heart pumping slow, hot pumps of blood. ""I checked
 my oxygen, Irish. Sixty minutes of breathing left.""


 The silence punctuated that sentence, too. Upon the sharp meteoric
 rocks Hathaway saw the tangled insides of the radio, the food supply
 mashed and scattered. They were lucky to have escaped. Or
was
suffocation a better death...?
Sixty minutes.
They stood and looked at one another.


 ""Damn that meteor!"" said Marnagan, hotly.


 Hathaway got hold of an idea; remembering something. He said it out:
 ""Somebody tossed that meteor, Irish. I took a picture of it, looked
 it right in the eye when it rolled at us, and it was poker-hot.
 Space-meteors are never hot and glowing. If it's proof you want, I've
 got it here, on film.""


 Marnagan winced his freckled square of face. ""It's not proof we need
 now, Click. Oxygen. And then
food
. And then some way back to Earth.""


 Hathaway went on saying his thoughts: ""This is Gunther's work. He's
 here somewhere, probably laughing his guts out at the job he did us.
 Oh, God, this would make great news-release stuff if we ever get back
 to Earth. I.P.'s Irish Marnagan, temporarily indisposed by a pirate
 whose dirty face has never been seen, Gunther by name, finally wins
 through to a triumphant finish. Photographed on the spot, in color, by
 yours truly, Click Hathaway. Cosmic Films, please notice.""
They started walking, fast, over the pocked, rubbled plain toward a
 bony ridge of metal. They kept their eyes wide and awake. There wasn't
 much to see, but it was better than standing still, waiting.


 Marnagan said, ""We're working on margin, and we got nothin' to sweat
 with except your suspicions about this not being an accident. We got
 fifty minutes to prove you're right. After that—right or wrong—you'll
 be Cosmic Films prettiest unmoving, unbreathin' genius. But talk all
 you like, Click. It's times like this when we all need words, any
 words, on our tongues. You got your camera and your scoop. Talk about
 it. As for me—"" he twisted his glossy red face. ""Keeping alive is me
 hobby. And this sort of two-bit death I did not order.""


 Click nodded. ""Gunther knows how you'd hate dying this way, Irish.
 It's irony clean through. That's probably why he planned the meteor and
 the crash this way.""


 Marnagan said nothing, but his thick lips went down at the corners, far
 down, and the green eyes blazed.


 They stopped, together.


 ""Oops!"" Click said.


 ""Hey!"" Marnagan blinked. ""Did you feel
that
?""


 Hathaway's body felt feathery, light as a whisper, boneless and
 limbless, suddenly. ""Irish! We lost weight, coming over that ridge!""


 They ran back. ""Let's try it again.""


 They tried it. They scowled at each other. The same thing happened.
 ""Gravity should not act this way, Click.""


 ""Are you telling me? It's man-made. Better than that—it's Gunther! No
 wonder we fell so fast—we were dragged down by a super-gravity set-up!
 Gunther'd do anything to—did I say
anything
?""


 Hathaway leaped backward in reaction. His eyes widened and his hand
 came up, jabbing. Over a hill-ridge swarmed a brew of unbelievable
 horrors. Progeny from Frankenstein's ARK. Immense crimson beasts with
 numerous legs and gnashing mandibles, brown-black creatures, some
 tubular and fat, others like thin white poisonous whips slashing along
 in the air. Fangs caught starlight white on them.


 Hathaway yelled and ran, Marnagan at his heels, lumbering. Sweat broke
 cold on his body. The immense things rolled, slithered and squirmed
 after him. A blast of light. Marnagan, firing his proton-gun. Then, in
 Click's ears, the Irishman's incredulous bellow. The gun didn't hurt
 the creatures at all.


 ""Irish!"" Hathaway flung himself over the ridge, slid down an incline
 toward the mouth a small cave. ""This way, fella!""


 Hathaway made it first, Marnagan bellowing just behind him. ""They're
 too big; they can't get us in here!"" Click's voice gasped it out,
 as Marnagan squeezed his two-hundred-fifty pounds beside him.
 Instinctively, Hathaway added, ""Asteroid monsters! My camera! What a
 scene!""


 ""Damn your damn camera!"" yelled Marnagan. ""They might come in!""


 ""Use your gun.""


 ""They got impervious hides. No use. Gahh! And that was a pretty chase,
 eh, Click?""


 ""Yeah. Sure.
You
enjoyed it, every moment of it.""


 ""I did that."" Irish grinned, showing white uneven teeth. ""Now, what
 will we be doing with these uninvited guests at our door?""


 ""Let me think—""


 ""Lots of time, little man. Forty more minutes of air, to be exact.""
They sat, staring at the monsters for about a minute. Hathaway felt
 funny about something; didn't know what. Something about these monsters
 and Gunther and—


 ""Which one will you be having?"" asked Irish, casually. ""A red one or a
 blue one?""


 Hathaway laughed nervously. ""A pink one with yellow ruffles—Good God,
 now you've got
me
doing it. Joking in the face of death.""


 ""Me father taught me; keep laughing and you'll have Irish luck.""


 That didn't please the photographer. ""I'm an Anglo-Swede,"" he pointed
 out.


 Marnagan shifted uneasily. ""Here, now. You're doing nothing but
 sitting, looking like a little boy locked in a bedroom closet, so take
 me a profile shot of the beasties and myself.""


 Hathaway petted his camera reluctantly. ""What in hell's the use? All
 this swell film shot. Nobody'll ever see it.""


 ""Then,"" retorted Marnagan, ""we'll develop it for our own benefit; while
 waitin' for the U.S. Cavalry to come riding over the hill to our
 rescue!""


 Hathaway snorted. ""U.S. Cavalry.""


 Marnagan raised his proton-gun dramatically. ""Snap me this pose,"" he
 said. ""I paid your salary to trot along, photographing, we hoped,
 my capture of Gunther, now the least you can do is record peace
 negotiations betwixt me and these pixies.""


 Marnagan wasn't fooling anybody. Hathaway knew the superficial palaver
 for nothing but a covering over the fast, furious thinking running
 around in that red-cropped skull. Hathaway played the palaver, too, but
 his mind was whirring faster than his camera as he spun a picture of
 Marnagan standing there with a useless gun pointed at the animals.


 Montage. Marnagan sitting, chatting at the monsters. Marnagan smiling
 for the camera. Marnagan in profile. Marnagan looking grim, without
 much effort, for the camera. And then, a closeup of the thrashing death
 wall that holed them in. Click took them all, those shots, not saying
 anything. Nobody fooled nobody with this act. Death was near and they
 had sweaty faces, dry mouths and frozen guts.


 When Click finished filming, Irish sat down to save oxygen, and used it
 up arguing about Gunther. Click came back at him:


 ""Gunther drew us down here, sure as Ceres! That gravity change we felt
 back on that ridge, Irish; that proves it. Gunther's short on men. So,
 what's he do; he builds an asteroid-base, and drags ships down. Space
 war isn't perfect yet, guns don't prime true in space, trajectory
 is lousy over long distances. So what's the best weapon, which
 dispenses with losing valuable, rare ships and a small bunch of men?
 Super-gravity and a couple of well-tossed meteors. Saves all around.
 It's a good front, this damned iron pebble. From it, Gunther strikes
 unseen; ships simply crash, that's all. A subtle hand, with all aces.""


 Marnagan rumbled. ""Where is the dirty son, then!""


 ""He didn't have to appear, Irish. He sent—them."" Hathaway nodded at
 the beasts. ""People crashing here die from air-lack, no food, or from
 wounds caused at the crackup. If they survive all that—the animals
 tend to them. It all looks like Nature was responsible. See how subtle
 his attack is? Looks like accidental death instead of murder, if the
 Patrol happens to land and finds us. No reason for undue investigation,
 then.""


 ""I don't see no Base around.""
Click shrugged. ""Still doubt it? Okay. Look."" He tapped his camera and
 a spool popped out onto his gloved palm. Holding it up, he stripped
 it out to its full twenty inch length, held it to the light while it
 developed, smiling. It was one of his best inventions. Self-developing
 film. The first light struck film-surface, destroyed one chemical,
 leaving imprints; the second exposure simply hardened, secured the
 impressions. Quick stuff.


 Inserting the film-tongue into a micro-viewer in the camera's base,
 Click handed the whole thing over. ""Look.""


 Marnagan put the viewer up against the helmet glass, squinted. ""Ah,
 Click. Now, now. This is one lousy film you invented.""


 ""Huh?""


 ""It's a strange process'll develop my picture and ignore the asteroid
 monsters complete.""


 ""What!""


 Hathaway grabbed the camera, gasped, squinted, and gasped again:
 Pictures in montage; Marnagan sitting down, chatting conversationally
 with
nothing
; Marnagan shooting his gun at
nothing
; Marnagan
 pretending to be happy in front of
nothing
.


 Then, closeup—of—NOTHING!


 The monsters had failed to image the film. Marnagan was there, his hair
 like a red banner, his freckled face with the blue eyes bright in it.
 Maybe—


 Hathaway said it, loud: ""Irish! Irish! I think I see a way out of this
 mess! Here—""


 He elucidated it over and over again to the Patrolman. About the film,
 the beasts, and how the film couldn't be wrong. If the film said the
 monsters weren't there, they weren't there.


 ""Yeah,"" said Marnagan. ""But step outside this cave—""


 ""If my theory is correct I'll do it, unafraid,"" said Click.


 Marnagan scowled. ""You sure them beasts don't radiate ultra-violet or
 infra-red or something that won't come out on film?""


 ""Nuts! Any color
we
see, the camera sees. We've been fooled.""


 ""Hey, where
you
going?"" Marnagan blocked Hathaway as the smaller man
 tried pushing past him.


 ""Get out of the way,"" said Hathaway.


 Marnagan put his big fists on his hips. ""If anyone is going anywhere,
 it'll be me does the going.""


 ""I can't let you do that, Irish.""


 ""Why not?""


 ""You'd be going on my say-so.""


 ""Ain't your say-so good enough for me?""


 ""Yes. Sure. Of course. I guess—""


 ""If you say them animals ain't there, that's all I need. Now, stand
 aside, you film-developing flea, and let an Irishman settle their
 bones."" He took an unnecessary hitch in trousers that didn't exist
 except under an inch of porous metal plate. ""Your express purpose on
 this voyage, Hathaway, is taking films to be used by the Patrol later
 for teaching Junior Patrolmen how to act in tough spots. First-hand
 education. Poke another spool of film in that contraption and give me
 profile a scan. This is lesson number seven: Daniel Walks Into The
 Lion's Den.""


 ""Irish, I—""


 ""Shut up and load up.""


 Hathaway nervously loaded the film-slot, raised it.


 ""Ready, Click?""


 ""I—I guess so,"" said Hathaway. ""And remember, think it hard, Irish.
 Think it hard. There aren't any animals—""


 ""Keep me in focus, lad.""


 ""All the way, Irish.""


 ""What do they say...? Oh, yeah. Action. Lights. Camera!""


 Marnagan held his gun out in front of him and still smiling took one,
 two, three, four steps out into the outside world. The monsters were
 waiting for him at the fifth step. Marnagan kept walking.


 Right out into the middle of them....
That was the sweetest shot Hathaway ever took. Marnagan and the
 monsters!


 Only now it was only Marnagan.


 No more monsters.


 Marnagan smiled a smile broader than his shoulders. ""Hey, Click, look
 at me! I'm in one piece. Why, hell, the damned things turned tail and
 ran away!""


 ""Ran, hell!"" cried Hathaway, rushing out, his face flushed and
 animated. ""They just plain vanished. They were only imaginative
 figments!""


 ""And to think we let them hole us in that way, Click Hathaway, you
 coward!""


 ""Smile when you say that, Irish.""


 ""Sure, and ain't I always smilin'? Ah, Click boy, are them tears in
 your sweet grey eyes?""


 ""Damn,"" swore the photographer, embarrassedly. ""Why don't they put
 window-wipers in these helmets?""


 ""I'll take it up with the Board, lad.""


 ""Forget it. I was so blamed glad to see your homely carcass in one
 hunk, I couldn't help—Look, now, about Gunther. Those animals are part
 of his set-up. Explorers who land here inadvertently, are chased back
 into their ships, forced to take off. Tourists and the like. Nothing
 suspicious about animals. And if the tourists don't leave, the animals
 kill them.""


 ""Shaw, now. Those animals can't kill.""


 ""Think not, Mr. Marnagan? As long as we believed in them they could
 have frightened us to death, forced us, maybe, to commit suicide. If
 that isn't being dangerous—""


 The Irishman whistled.


 ""But, we've got to
move
, Irish. We've got twenty minutes of oxygen.
 In that time we've got to trace those monsters to their source,
 Gunther's Base, fight our way in, and get fresh oxy-cannisters."" Click
 attached his camera to his mid-belt. ""Gunther probably thinks we're
 dead by now. Everyone else's been fooled by his playmates; they never
 had a chance to disbelieve them.""


 ""If it hadn't been for you taking them pictures, Click—""


 ""Coupled with your damned stubborn attitude about the accident—"" Click
 stopped and felt his insides turning to water. He shook his head and
 felt a film slip down over his eyes. He spread his legs out to steady
 himself, and swayed. ""I—I don't think my oxygen is as full as yours.
 This excitement had me double-breathing and I feel sick.""


 Marnagan's homely face grimaced in sympathy. ""Hold tight, Click. The
 guy that invented these fish-bowls didn't provide for a sick stomach.""


 ""Hold tight, hell, let's move. We've got to find where those animals
 came from! And the only way to do that is to get the animals to come
 back!""


 ""Come back? How?""


 ""They're waiting, just outside the aura of our thoughts, and if we
 believe in them again, they'll return.""


 Marnagan didn't like it. ""Won't—won't they kill us—if they come—if
 we believe in 'em?""


 Hathaway shook a head that was tons heavy and weary. ""Not if we believe
 in them to a
certain point
. Psychologically they can both be seen and
 felt. We only want to
see
them coming at us again.""


 ""
Do
we, now?""


 ""With twenty minutes left, maybe less—""


 ""All right, Click, let's bring 'em back. How do we do it?""


 Hathaway fought against the mist in his eyes. ""Just think—I will see
 the monsters again. I will see them again and I will not feel them.
 Think it over and over.""


 Marnagan's hulk stirred uneasily. ""And—what if I forget to remember
 all that? What if I get excited...?""


 Hathaway didn't answer. But his eyes told the story by just looking at
 Irish.


 Marnagan cursed. ""All right, lad. Let's have at it!""


 The monsters returned.
A soundless deluge of them, pouring over the rubbled horizon, swarming
 in malevolent anticipation about the two men.


 ""This way, Irish. They come from this way! There's a focal point, a
 sending station for these telepathic brutes. Come on!""


 Hathaway sludged into the pressing tide of color, mouths, contorted
 faces, silvery fat bodies misting as he plowed through them.
Marnagan was making good progress ahead of Hathaway. But he stopped and
 raised his gun and made quick moves with it. ""Click! This one here!
 It's real!"" He fell back and something struck him down. His immense
 frame slammed against rock, noiselessly.


 Hathaway darted forward, flung his body over Marnagan's, covered the
 helmet glass with his hands, shouting:


 ""Marnagan! Get a grip, dammit! It's not real—don't let it force into
 your mind! It's not real, I tell you!""


 ""Click—"" Marnagan's face was a bitter, tortured movement behind glass.
 ""Click—"" He was fighting hard. ""I—I—sure now. Sure—"" He smiled.
 ""It—it's only a shanty fake!""


 ""Keep saying it, Irish. Keep it up.""


 Marnagan's thick lips opened. ""It's only a fake,"" he said. And then,
 irritated, ""Get the hell off me, Hathaway. Let me up to my feet!""


 Hathaway got up, shakily. The air in his helmet smelled stale, and
 little bubbles danced in his eyes. ""Irish,
you
forget the monsters.
 Let me handle them, I know how. They might fool you again, you might
 forget.""


 Marnagan showed his teeth. ""Gah! Let a flea have all the fun? And
 besides, Click, I like to look at them. They're pretty.""


 The outpour of animals came from a low lying mound a mile farther on.
 Evidently the telepathic source lay there. They approached it warily.


 ""We'll be taking our chances on guard,"" hissed Irish. ""I'll go ahead,
 draw their attention, maybe get captured. Then,
you
show up with
your
gun....""


 ""I haven't got one.""


 ""We'll chance it, then. You stick here until I see what's ahead. They
 probably got scanners out. Let them see me—""


 And before Hathaway could object, Marnagan walked off. He walked about
 five hundred yards, bent down, applied his fingers to something, heaved
 up, and there was a door opening in the rock.


 His voice came back across the distance, into Click's earphones. ""A
 door, an air-lock, Click. A tunnel leading down inside!""


 Then, Marnagan dropped into the tunnel, disappearing. Click heard the
 thud of his feet hitting the metal flooring.


 Click sucked in his breath, hard and fast.


 ""All right, put 'em up!"" a new harsh voice cried over a different
 radio. One of Gunther's guards.


 Three shots sizzled out, and Marnagan bellowed.


 The strange harsh voice said, ""That's better. Don't try and pick that
 gun up now. Oh, so it's you. I thought Gunther had finished you off.
 How'd you get past the animals?""


 Click started running. He switched off his
sending
audio, kept his
receiving
on. Marnagan, weaponless.
One
guard. Click gasped. Things
 were getting dark. Had to have air. Air. Air. He ran and kept running
 and listening to Marnagan's lying voice:


 ""I tied them pink elephants of Gunther's in neat alphabetical bundles
 and stacked them up to dry, ya louse!"" Marnagan said. ""But, damn you,
 they killed my partner before he had a chance!""


 The guard laughed.
The air-lock door was still wide open when Click reached it, his head
 swimming darkly, his lungs crammed with pain-fire and hell-rockets. He
 let himself down in, quiet and soft. He didn't have a weapon. He didn't
 have a weapon. Oh, damn, damn!


 A tunnel curved, ending in light, and two men silhouetted in that
 yellow glare. Marnagan, backed against a wall, his helmet cracked,
 air hissing slowly out of it, his face turning blue. And the guard, a
 proton gun extended stiffly before him, also in a vac-suit. The guard
 had his profile toward Hathaway, his lips twisting: ""I think I'll let
 you stand right there and die,"" he said quietly. ""That what Gunther
 wanted, anway. A nice sordid death.""


 Hathaway took three strides, his hands out in front of him.


 ""Don't move!"" he snapped. ""I've got a weapon stronger than yours. One
 twitch and I'll blast you and the whole damned wall out from behind
 you! Freeze!""


 The guard whirled. He widened his sharp eyes, and reluctantly, dropped
 his gun to the floor.


 ""Get his gun, Irish.""


 Marnagan made as if to move, crumpled clumsily forward.


 Hathaway ran in, snatched up the gun, smirked at the guard. ""Thanks for
 posing,"" he said. ""That shot will go down in film history for candid
 acting.""


 ""What!""


 ""Ah: ah! Keep your place. I've got a real gun now. Where's the door
 leading into the Base?""


 The guard moved his head sullenly over his left shoulder.


 Click was afraid he would show his weak dizziness. He needed air.
 ""Okay. Drag Marnagan with you, open the door and we'll have air. Double
 time! Double!""


 Ten minutes later, Marnagan and Hathaway, fresh tanks of oxygen on
 their backs, Marnagan in a fresh bulger and helmet, trussed the guard,
 hid him in a huge trash receptacle. ""Where he belongs,"" observed Irish
 tersely.


 They found themselves in a complete inner world; an asteroid nothing
 more than a honey-comb fortress sliding through the void unchallenged.
 Perfect front for a raider who had little equipment and was
 short-handed of men. Gunther simply waited for specific cargo ships to
 rocket by, pulled them or knocked them down and swarmed over them for
 cargo. The animals served simply to insure against suspicion and the
 swarms of tourists that filled the void these days. Small fry weren't
 wanted. They were scared off.


 The telepathic sending station for the animals was a great bank of
 intricate, glittering machine, through which strips of colored film
 with images slid into slots and machine mouths that translated them
 into thought-emanations. A damned neat piece of genius.


 ""So here we are, still not much better off than we were,"" growled
 Irish. ""We haven't a ship or a space-radio, and more guards'll turn
 up any moment. You think we could refocus this doohingey, project the
 monsters inside the asteroid to fool the pirates themselves?""


 ""What good would that do?"" Hathaway gnawed his lip. ""They wouldn't fool
 the engineers who created them, you nut.""


 Marnagan exhaled disgustedly. ""Ah, if only the U.S. Cavalry would come
 riding over the hill—""
""Irish!"" Hathaway snapped that, his face lighting up. ""Irish. The U.S.
 Cavalry it is!"" His eyes darted over the machines. ""Here. Help me.
 We'll stage everything on the most colossal raid of the century.""


 Marnagan winced. ""You breathing oxygen or whiskey?""


 ""There's only one stipulation I make, Irish. I want a complete picture
 of Marnagan capturing Raider's Base. I want a picture of Gunther's face
 when you do it. Snap it, now, we've got rush work to do. How good an
 actor are you?""


 ""That's a silly question.""


 ""You only have to do three things. Walk with your gun out in front of
 you, firing. That's number one. Number two is to clutch at your heart
 and fall down dead. Number three is to clutch at your side, fall down
 and twitch on the ground. Is that clear?""


 ""Clear as the Coal Sack Nebula....""


 An hour later Hathaway trudged down a passageway that led out into a
 sort of city street inside the asteroid. There were about six streets,
 lined with cube houses in yellow metal, ending near Hathaway in a
 wide, green-lawned Plaza.


 Hathaway, weaponless, idly carrying his camera in one hand, walked
 across the Plaza as if he owned it. He was heading for a building that
 was pretentious enough to be Gunther's quarters.


 He got halfway there when he felt a gun in his back.


 He didn't resist. They took him straight ahead to his destination and
 pushed him into a room where Gunther sat.


 Hathaway looked at him. ""So you're Gunther?"" he said, calmly. The
 pirate was incredibly old, his bulging forehead stood out over sunken,
 questioningly dark eyes, and his scrawny body was lost in folds of
 metal-link cloth. He glanced up from a paper-file, surprised. Before he
 could speak, Hathaway said:


 ""Everything's over with, Mr. Gunther. The Patrol is in the city now and
 we're capturing your Base. Don't try to fight. We've a thousand men
 against your eighty-five.""


 Gunther sat there, blinking at Hathaway, not moving. His thin hands
 twitched in his lap. ""You are bluffing,"" he said, finally, with a firm
 directness. ""A ship hasn't landed here for an hour. Your ship was the
 last. Two people were on it. The last I saw of them they were being
 pursued to the death by the Beasts. One of you escaped, it seemed.""


 ""Both. The other guy went after the Patrol.""


 ""Impossible!""


 ""I can't respect your opinion, Mr. Gunther.""


 A shouting rose from the Plaza. About fifty of Gunther's men, lounging
 on carved benches during their time-off, stirred to their feet and
 started yelling. Gunther turned slowly to the huge window in one side
 of his office. He stared, hard.


 The Patrol was coming!


 Across the Plaza, marching quietly and decisively, came the Patrol.
 Five hundred Patrolmen in one long, incredible line, carrying paralysis
 guns with them in their tight hands.


 Gunther babbled like a child, his voice a shrill dagger in the air.
 ""Get out there, you men! Throw them back! We're outnumbered!""


 Guns flared. But the Patrol came on. Gunther's men didn't run, Hathaway
 had to credit them on that. They took it, standing.


 Hathaway chuckled inside, deep. What a sweet, sweet shot this was.
 His camera whirred, clicked and whirred again. Nobody stopped him
 from filming it. Everything was too wild, hot and angry. Gunther was
 throwing a fit, still seated at his desk, unable to move because of his
 fragile, bony legs and their atrophied state.


 Some of the Patrol were killed. Hathaway chuckled again as he saw three
 of the Patrolmen clutch at their hearts, crumple, lie on the ground and
 twitch. God, what photography!


 Gunther raged, and swept a small pistol from his linked corselet. He
 fired wildly until Hathaway hit him over the head with a paper-weight.
 Then Hathaway took a picture of Gunther slumped at his desk, the chaos
 taking place immediately outside his window.

The house was furnished with all

 luxuries, including women. If it only

 had a lease that could be broken—
Roger Tennant, crossing the lawn, could see two of the three wings
 of the house, which radiated spoke-like from its heptagonal central
 portion. The wing on the left was white, with slim square pillars,
 reminiscent of scores of movie sets of the Deep South. That on the
 right was sundeck solar-house living-machine modern, something like a
 montage of shoeboxes. The wing hidden by the rest of the house was, he
 knew, spired, gabled and multicolored, like an ancient building in
 pre-Hitler Cracow.
Dana was lying under a tree near the door, stretched out on a sort
 of deck chair with her eyes closed. She wore a golden gown, long and
 close-fitting and slit up the leg like the gown of a Chinese woman.
 Above it her comely face was sullen beneath its sleek cocoon of auburn
 hair.


 She opened her eyes at his approach and regarded him with nothing like
 favor. Involuntarily he glanced down at the tartan shorts that were his
 only garment to make sure that they were on properly. They were. He had
 thought them up in a moment of utter boredom and they were extremely
 comfortable. However, the near-Buchanan tartan did not crease or even
 wrinkle when he moved. Their captors had no idea of how a woven design
 should behave.


 ""Waiting for me?"" Tennant asked the girl.


 She said, ""I'd rather be dead. Maybe I am. Maybe we're all dead and
 this is Hell.""


 He stood over her and looked down until she turned away her reddening
 face. He said, ""So it's going to be you again, Dana. You'll be the
 first to come back for a second run.""


 ""Don't flatter yourself,"" she replied angrily. She sat up, pushed
 back her hair, got to her feet a trifle awkwardly because of the
 tight-fitting tubular gown. ""If I could do anything about it....""


 ""But you can't,"" he told her. ""They're too clever.""


 ""Is this crop rotation or did you send for me?"" she asked cynically.
 ""If you did, I wish you hadn't. You haven't asked about your son.""


 ""I don't even want to think about him,"" said Tennant. ""Let's get
 on with it."" He could sense the restless stirring of the woman
 within Dana, just as he could feel the stirring toward her within
 himself—desire that both of them loathed because it was implanted
 within them by their captors.


 They walked toward the house.
It didn't look like a prison—or a cage. Within the dome of the
 barrier, it looked more like a well-kept if bizarre little country
 estate. There was clipped lawn, a scattering of trees, even a clear
 little brook that chattered unending annoyance at the small stones
 which impeded its flow.


 But the lawn was not of grass—it was of a bright green substance that
 might have been cellophane but wasn't, and it sprouted from a fabric
 that might have been canvas but was something else. The trees looked
 like trees, only their trunks were bark all the way through—except
 that it was not bark. The brook was practically water, but the small
 stones over which it flowed were of no earthly mineral.


 They entered the house, which had no roof, continued to move beneath a
 sky that glowed with light which did not come from a sun or moon. It
 might have been a well-kept if bizarre little country estate, but it
 wasn't. It was a prison, a cage.


 The other two women were sitting in the heptagonal central hall.
 Eudalia, who had borne twin girls recently, was lying back, newly thin
 and dark of skin and hair, smoking a scentless cigarette. A tall woman,
 thirtyish, she wore a sort of shimmering green strapless evening gown.
 Tennant wondered how she maintained it in place, for despite her recent
 double motherhood, she was almost flat of bosom. He asked her how she
 was feeling.


 ""Okay, I guess,"" she said. ""The way they manage it, there's nothing
 to it."" She had a flat, potentially raucous voice. Eudalia had been
 a female foreman in a garment-cutting shop before being captured and
 brought through.


 ""Good,"" he said. ""Glad to hear it."" He felt oddly embarrassed. He
 turned to Olga, broad, blonde and curiously vital, who sat perfectly
 still, regarding him over the pregnant swell of her dirndl-clad waist.
 Olga had been a waitress in a mining town hash-house near Scranton.


 Tennant wanted to put an encouraging hand on her shoulder, to say
 something that might cheer her up, for she was by far the youngest of
 the three female captives, barely nineteen. But with the eyes of the
 other two, especially Dana, upon him, he could not.


 ""I guess I wasn't cut out to be a Turk,"" he said. ""I don't feel at ease
 in a harem, even when it's supposedly my own.""


 ""You're not doing so badly,"" Dana replied acidly.


 ""Lay off—he can't help it,"" said Eudalia unexpectedly. ""He doesn't
 like it any better than we do.""


 ""But he doesn't have to—have them,"" objected Olga. She had a trace of
 Polish accent that was not unpleasant. In fact, Tennant thought, only
 her laughter was unpleasant, a shrill, uncontrolled burst of staccato
 sound that jarred him to his heels. Olga had not laughed of late,
 however. She was too frightened.
""Let's get the meal ordered,"" said Dana and they were all silent,
 thinking of what they wanted to eat but would not enjoy when it came.
 Tennant finished with his order, then got busy with his surprise.


 It arrived before the meal, materializing against one of the seven
 walls of the roofless chamber. It was a large cabinet on slender
 straight legs that resembled dark polished wood. Tennant went to it,
 opened a hingeless door and pushed a knob on the inner surface. At once
 the air was hideous with the acerate harmony of a singing commercial....

... so go soak your head,
be it gold, brown or red,
in Any-tone Shampoo!

 A disc jockey's buoyant tones cut in quickly as the final
ooooo
faded. ""This is Grady Martin, your old night-owl, coming to you with
 your requests over Station WZZX, Manhattan. Here's a wire from Theresa
 McManus and the girls in the family entrance of Conaghan's Bar and
 Grill on West....""


 Tennant watched the girls as a sweet-voiced crooner began to ply
 an unfamiliar love lyric to a melody whose similarity to a thousand
 predecessors doomed it to instant success.


 Olga sat up straight, her pale blue eyes round with utter disbelief.
 She looked at the radio, at Tennant, at the other two women, then back
 at the machine. She murmured something in Polish that was inaudible,
 but her expression showed that it must have been wistful.


 Eudalia grinned at Tennant and, rising, did a sort of tap dance to the
 music, then whirled back into her chair, green dress ashimmer, and sank
 into it just to listen.


 Dana stood almost in the center of the room, carmine-tipped fingers
 clasped beneath the swell of her breasts. She might have been listening
 to Brahms or Debussy. Her eyes glowed with the salty brilliance of
 emotion and she was almost beautiful.


 ""
Rog!
"" she cried softly when the music stopped. ""A radio and WZZX! Is
 it—are they—real?""


 ""As real as you or I,"" he told her. ""It took quite a bit of doing,
 getting them to put a set together. And I wasn't sure that radio would
 get through. TV doesn't seem to. Somehow it brings things closer....""


 Olga got up quite suddenly, went to the machine and, after frowning at
 it for a moment, tuned in another station from which a Polish-speaking
 announcer was followed by polka music. She leaned against the wall,
 resting one smooth forearm on the top of the machine. Her eyes closed
 and she swayed a little in time to the polka beat.
Tennant caught Dana looking at him and there was near approval in her
 expression—approval that faded quickly as soon as she caught his gaze
 upon her. The food arrived then and they sat down at the round table to
 eat it.


 Tennant's meat looked like steak, it felt like steak, but, lacking the
 aroma of steak, it was almost tasteless. This was so with all of their
 foods, with their cigarettes, with everything in their prison—or their
 cage. Their captors were utterly without a human conception of smell,
 living, apparently, in a world without odor at all.


 Dana said suddenly, ""I named the boy Tom, after somebody I hate almost
 as much as I hate you.""


 Eudalia laid down her fork with a clatter and regarded Dana
 disapprovingly. ""Why take it out on Rog?"" she asked bluntly. ""He didn't
 ask to come here any more than we did. He's got a wife back home. Maybe
 you want him to fall in love with you? Maybe you're jealous because
 he doesn't? Well, maybe he can't! And maybe it wouldn't work, the way
 things are arranged here.""


 ""Thanks, Eudalia,"" said Tennant. ""I think I can defend myself. But
 she's right, Dana. We're as helpless as—laboratory animals. They have
 the means to make us do whatever they want.""


 ""Rog,"" said Dana, looking suddenly scared, ""I'm sorry I snapped at you.
 I know it's not your fault. I'm—
changing
.""


 He shook his head. ""No, Dana, you're not changing. You're adapting. We
 all are. We seem to be in a universe of different properties as well as
 different dimensions. We're adjusting. I can do a thing or two myself
 that seem absolutely impossible.""


 ""Are we really in the fourth dimension?"" Dana asked. Of the three of
 them, she alone had more than a high-school education.


 ""We may be in the eleventh for all I know,"" he told her. ""But I'll
 settle for the fourth—a fourth dimension in space, if that makes
 scientific sense, because we don't seem to have moved in time. I wasn't
 sure of that, though, till we got the radio.""


 ""Why haven't they brought more of us through?"" Eudalia asked, tamping
 out ashes in a tray that might have been silver.


 ""I'm not sure,"" he said thoughtfully. ""I think it's hard for them. They
 have a hell of a time bringing anyone through alive, and lately they
 haven't brought anyone through—not alive.""


 ""Why do they do it—the other way, I mean?"" asked Dana.


 Tennant shrugged. ""I don't know. I've been thinking about it. I suppose
 it's because they're pretty human.""


 ""
Human!
"" Dana was outraged. ""Do you call it human to—""


 ""Hold on,"" he said. ""They pass through their gateway to Earth at
 considerable danger and, probably, expense of some kind. Some of them
 don't come back. They kill those of us who put up a fight. Those who
 don't—or can't—they bring back with them. Live or dead, we're just
 laboratory specimens.""


 ""Maybe,"" Eudalia conceded doubtfully. Then her eyes blazed. ""But the
 things they do—stuffing people, mounting their heads, keeping them on
 display in their—their whatever they live in. You call that human,
 Rog?""


 ""Were you ever in a big-game hunter's trophy room?"" Tennant asked
 quietly. ""Or in a Museum of Natural History? A zoo? A naturalist's lab?
 Or even, maybe, photographed as a baby on a bear-skin rug?""


 ""I was,"" said Olga. ""But that's not the same thing.""


 ""Of course not,"" he agreed. ""In the one instance,
we're
the hunters,
 the breeders, the trophy collectors. In the other""—he shrugged—""we're
 the trophies.""
There was a long silence. They finished eating and then Dana stood up
 and said, ""I'm going out on the lawn for a while."" She unzipped her
 golden gown, stepped out of it to reveal a pair of tartan shorts that
 matched his, and a narrow halter.


 ""You thought those up while we ate,"" he said. It annoyed him to be
 copied, though he did not know why. She laughed at him silently, tossed
 her auburn hair back from her face and went out of the roofless house,
 holding the gold dress casually over her bare arm.


 Eudalia took him to the nursery. He was irritated now in another,
 angrier way. The infants, protected by cellophane-like coverlets, were
 asleep.


 ""They never cry,"" the thin woman told him. ""But they grow—God, how
 they grow!""


 ""Good,"" said Tennant, fighting down his anger. He kissed her, held
 her close, although neither of them felt desire at the moment. Their
 captors had seen to that; it wasn't Eudalia's turn. Tennant said, ""I
 wish I could do something about this. I hate seeing Dana so bitter and
 Olga so scared. It isn't their fault.""


 ""And it's not yours,"" insisted Eudalia. ""Don't let them make you think
 it is.""


 ""I'll try not to,"" he said and stopped, realizing the family party was
 over. He had felt the inner tug of command, said good-by to the women
 and returned to his smaller compound within its own barrier dome.


 Then came the invisible aura of strain in the air, the shimmering
 illusion of heat that was not heat, that was prelude to his
 teleportation ... if that were the word. It was neither pleasant nor
 unpleasant; it
was
, that was all.


 He called it the training hall, not because it looked like a training
 hall but because that was its function. It didn't actually look like
 anything save some half-nourished dream a surrealist might have
 discarded as too nightmarish for belief.


 As in all of this strange universe, excepting the dome-cages in
 which the captives were held, the training hall followed no rules of
 three-dimensional space. One wall looked normal for perhaps a third of
 its length, then it simply wasn't for a bit. It came back farther on
 at an impossible angle. Yet, walking along it, touching it, it felt
 perfectly smooth and continuously straight.


 The opposite wall resembled a diagonal cross-section of an asymmetrical
 dumbbell—that was the closest Tennant could come to it in words. And
 it, too, felt straight. The floor looked like crystal smashed by some
 cosmic impact, yet it had reason. He
knew
this even though no reason
 was apparent to his three-dimensional vision. The ceiling, where he
 could see it, was beyond description.


 The captor Tennant called
Opal
came in through a far corner of
 the ceiling. He—if it was a he—was not large, although this,
 Tennant knew, meant nothing; Opal might extend thousands of yards in
 some unseen direction. He had no regular shape and much of him was
 iridescent and shot with constantly changing colors. Hence the name
 Opal.


 Communication was telepathic. Tennant could have yodeled or yelled
 or sung
Mississippi Mud
and Opal would have shown no reaction. Yet
 Tennant suspected that the captors could hear somewhere along the
 auditory scale, just as perhaps they could smell, although not in any
 human sense.
You will approach without use of your appendages.
The command was as clear as if it had been spoken aloud. Tennant took a
 deep breath. He thought of the space beside Opal. It took about three
 seconds and he was there, having spanned a distance of some ninety
 feet. He was getting good at it.


 Dog does trick, he thought.
He went through the entire routine at Opal's bidding. When at last
 he was allowed to relax, he wondered, not for the first time, if he
 weren't mastering some of the alleged Guru arts. At once he felt
 probing investigation. Opal, like the rest of the captors, was as
 curious as a cat—or a human being.
Tennant sat against a wall, drenched with sweat. There would be endless
 repetition before his workout was done. On Earth, dogs were said to be
 intellectually two-dimensional creatures. He wondered if they felt this
 helpless futility when their masters taught them to heel, to point, to
 retrieve.


 Some days later, the training routine was broken. He felt a sudden stir
 of near-sick excitement as he received the thought:
Now you are ready. We are going through at last.
Opal was nervous, so much so that he revealed more than he intended.
 Or perhaps that was his intent; Tennant could never be sure. They were
 going through to Tennant's own dimension. He wondered briefly just what
 his role was to be.


 He had little time to speculate before Opal seemed to envelop him.
 There was the blurring wrench of forced teleportation and they were in
 another room, a room which ended in a huge irregular passage that might
 have been the interior of a giant concertina—or an old-fashioned kodak.


 He stood before a kidney-shaped object over whose jagged surface
 colors played constantly. From Opal's thoughts it appeared to be some
 sort of ultradimensional television set, but to Tennant it was as
 incomprehensible as an oil painting to an animal.


 Opal was annoyed that Tennant could make nothing of it. Then came the
 thought:
What cover must your body have not to be conspicuous?
Tennant wondered, cynically, what would happen if he were to demand
 a costume of mediaeval motley, complete with Pied Piper's flute. He
 received quick reproof that made his head ring as from a blow.


 He asked Opal where and when they were going, was informed that
 he would soon emerge on Earth where he had left it. That told him
 everything but the date and season. Opal, like the rest of the captors,
 seemed to have no understanding of time in a human sense.


 Waiting, Tennant tried not to think of his wife, of the fact that he
 hadn't seen her in—was it more than a year and a half on Earth? He
 could have controlled his heartbeat with one of his new powers, but
 that might have made Opal suspicious. He should be somewhat excited.
 He allowed himself to be, though he obscured the reasons. He was going
 to see his wife again ... and maybe he could trick his way into not
 returning.
The maid who opened the door for him was new, although her eyes were
 old. But she recognized him and stood aside to let him enter. There
 must, he thought, still be pictures of him around. He wondered how
 Agatha could afford a servant.


 ""Is Mrs. Tennant in?"" he asked.


 She shook her head and fright made twin stoplights of the rouge on her
 cheeks as she shut the door behind him. He went into the living room,
 directly to the long silver cigarette box on the coffee table. It was
 proof of homecoming to fill his lungs with smoke he could
smell
. He
 took another drag, saw the maid still in the doorway, staring.


 ""There's no need for fright,"" he told her. ""I believe I still own this
 house."" Then, ""When do you expect Mrs. Tennant?""


 ""She just called. She's on her way home from the club.""


 Still looking frightened, she departed for the rear of the house.
 Tennant stared after her puzzledly until the kitchen door swung shut
 behind her. The club? What club?


 He shrugged, returned to the feeling of comfort that came from being
 back here, about to see Agatha again, hold her close in no more than a
 few minutes. And stay, his mind began to add eagerly, but he pushed the
 thought down where Opal could not detect it.


 He took another deep, lung-filling drag on his cigarette, looked around
 the room that was so important a part of his life. The three women back
 there would be in a ghastly spot. He felt like a heel for wanting to
 leave them there, then knew that he would try somehow to get them out.
 Not, of course, anything that would endanger his remaining with Agatha;
 the only way his captors would get him back would be as a taxidermist's
 specimen.


 He realized, shocked and scared, that his thoughts of escape had
 slipped past his mental censor, and he waited apprehensively for Opal
 to strike. Nothing happened and he warily relaxed. Opal wasn't tapping
 his thoughts. Because he felt sure of his captive ... or because he
 couldn't on Earth?


 It was like being let out of a cage. Tennant grinned at the bookcase;
 the ebony-and-ivory elephants that Agatha had never liked were gone,
 but he'd get them back or another pair. The credenza had been replaced
 by a huge and ugly television console. That, he resolved, would go down
 in the cellar rumpus room, where its bleached modernity wouldn't clash
 with the casual antiquity of the living room.


 Agatha would complain, naturally, but his being back would make up for
 any amount of furniture shifting. He imagined her standing close to
 him, her lovely face lifted to be kissed, and his heart lurched like an
 adolescent's. This hunger was real, not implanted. Everything would be
 real ... his love for her, the food he ate, the things he touched, his
 house, his life....
Your wife and a man are approaching the house.
The thought message from Opal crumbled his illusion of freedom. He sank
 down in a chair, trying to refuse to listen to the rest of the command:
You are to bring the man through the gateway with you. We want another
 live male.
Tennant shook his head, stiff and defiant in his chair. The punishment,
 when it came, was more humiliating than a slap across a dog's snout.
 Opal had been too interested in the next lab specimen to bother about
 his thoughts—that was why he had been free to think of escape.


 Tennant closed his eyes, willed himself to the front window. Now that
 he had mastered teleportation, it was incredible how much easier it was
 in his own world. He had covered the two miles from the gateway to the
 house in a mere seven jumps, the distance to the window in an instant.
 But there was no pleasure in it, only a confirmation of his captor's
 power over him.


 He was not free of them. He understood all too well what they wanted
 him to do; he was to play the Judas goat ... or rather the Judas ram,
 leading another victim to the fourth-dimensional pen.


 Grim, he watched the swoop of headlights in the driveway and returned
 to the coffee table, lit a fresh cigarette.


 The front door was flung open and his diaphragm tightened at the
 remembered sound of Agatha's throaty laugh ... and tightened further
 when it was followed by a deeper rumbling laugh. Sudden fear made the
 cigarette shake in his fingers.


 ""... Don't be such a stuffed-shirt, darling."" Agatha's mocking
 sweetness rang alarm-gongs in Tennant's memory. ""Charley wasn't making
 a grab for
me
. He'd had one too many and only wanted a little fun.
 Really, darling, you seem to think that a girl....""


 Her voice faded out as she saw Tennant standing there. She was wearing
 a white strapless gown, had a blue-red-and-gold Mandarin jacket slung
 hussar-fashion over her left shoulder. She looked even sleeker, better
 groomed, more assured than his memory of her.


 ""I'm no stuffed-shirt and you know it."" Cass' tone was peevish. ""But
 your idea of fun, Agatha, is pretty damn....""


 It was his turn to freeze. Unbelieving, Tennant studied his successor.
 Cass Gordon—the
man
, the ex-halfback whose bulk was beginning to get
 out of hand, but whose inherent aggressive grace had not yet deserted
 him. The
man
, that was all—unless one threw in the little black
 mustache and the smooth salesman's manner.


 ""You know, Cass,"" Tennant said quietly, ""I never for a moment dreamed
 it would be you.""


 ""
Roger!
"" Agatha found her voice. ""You're
alive
!""


 ""Roger,"" repeated Tennant viciously. He felt sick with disgust. Maybe
 he should have expected a triangle, but somehow he hadn't. And here
 it was, with all of them going through their paces like a trio of
 tent-show actors. He said, ""For God's sake, sit down.""


 Agatha did so hesitantly. Her huge dark eyes, invariably clear
 and limpid no matter how much she had drunk, flickered toward him
 furtively. She said defensively, ""I had detectives looking for you for
 six months. Where have you been, Rog? Smashing up the car like that
 and—disappearing! I've been out of my mind.""


 ""Sorry,"" said Tennant. ""I've had my troubles, too."" Agatha was scared
 stiff—of him. Probably with reason. He looked again at Cass Gordon and
 found that he suddenly didn't care. She couldn't say it was loneliness.
 Women have waited longer than eighteen months. He would have if his
 captors had let him.


 ""Where in hell
have
you been, Rog?"" Gordon's tone was almost
 parental. ""I don't suppose it's news to you, but there was a lot of
 suspicion directed your way while that crazy killer was operating
 around here. Agatha and I managed to clear you.""


 ""Decent of you,"" said Tennant. He got up, crossed to the cabinet that
 served as a bar. It was fully equipped—with more expensive liquor, he
 noticed, than he had ever been able to afford. He poured a drink of
 brandy, waited for the others to fill their glasses.
Agatha looked at him over the rim of hers. ""Tell us, Rog. We have a
 right to know. I do, anyway.""


 ""One question first,"" he said. ""What about those killings? Have there
 been any lately?""


 ""Not for over a year,"" Cass told him. ""They never did get the devil who
 skinned those bodies and removed the heads.""


 So, Tennant thought, they hadn't used the gateway. Not since they had
 brought the four of them through, not since they had begun to train him
 for his Judas ram duties.


 Agatha was asking him if he had been abroad.


 ""In a way,"" he replied unemotionally. ""Sorry if I've worried you,
 Agatha, but my life has been rather—indefinite, since I—left.""


 He was standing no more than four inches from this woman he had desired
 desperately for six years, and he no longer wanted her. He was acutely
 conscious of her perfume. It wrapped them both like an exotic blanket,
 and it repelled him. He studied the firm clear flesh of her cheek and
 chin, the arch of nostril, the carmine fullness of lower lip, the
 swell of bosom above low-cut gown. And he no longer wanted any of it or
 of her. Cass Gordon—


 It didn't have to be anybody at all. For it to be Cass Gordon was
 revolting.


 ""Rog,"" she said and her voice trembled, ""what are we going to do? What
 do you
want
to do?""


 Take her back? He smiled ironically; she wouldn't know what that meant.
 It would serve her right, but maybe there was another way.


 ""I don't know about you,"" he said, ""but I suspect we're in the same
 boat. I also have other interests.""


 ""You louse!"" said Cass Gordon, arching rib cage and nostrils. ""If you
 try to make trouble for Agatha, I can promise....""


 ""
What
can you promise?"" demanded Tennant. When Gordon's onset
 subsided in mumbles, he added, ""Actually, I don't think I'm capable of
 making more than a fraction of the trouble for either of you that you
 both are qualified to make for yourselves.""


 He lit a cigarette, inhaled. ""Relax. I'm not planning revenge. After
 this evening, I plan to vanish for good. Of course, Agatha, that
 offers you a minor nuisance. You will have to wait six years to marry
 Cass—seven years if the maid who let me in tonight talks. That's the
 law, isn't it, Cass? You probably had it all figured out.""


 ""You bastard,"" said Cass. ""You dirty bastard! You know what a wait like
 that could do to us.""


 ""Tristan and Isolde,"" said Tennant, grinning almost happily. ""Well,
 I've had my little say. Now I'm off again. Cass, would you give me a
 lift? I have a conveyance of sorts a couple of miles down the road.""
He needed no telepathic powers to read the thoughts around him then. He
 heard Agatha's quick intake of breath, saw the split-second look she
 exchanged with Cass. He turned away, knowing that she was imploring her
 lover to do something,
anything
, as long as it was safe.


 Deliberately, Tennant poured himself a second drink. This might be
 easier and pleasanter than he had expected. They deserved some of the
 suffering he had had and there was a chance that they might get it.


 Tennant knew now why he was the only male human the captors had been
 able to take alive. Apparently, thanks to the rain-slick road, he had
 run the sedan into a tree at the foot of the hill beyond the river. He
 had been sitting there, unconscious, ripe fruit on their doorstep. They
 had simply picked him up.


 Otherwise, apparently, men were next to impossible for them to capture.
 All they could do was kill them and bring back their heads and hides
 as trophies. With women it was different—perhaps the captors' weapons,
 whatever they were, worked more efficiently on females. A difference in
 body chemistry or psychology, perhaps.


 More than once, during his long training with Opal, Tennant had sent
 questing thoughts toward his captor, asking why they didn't simply set
 up the gateway in some town or city and take as many humans as they
 wanted.


 Surprisingly there had been a definite fear reaction. As nearly as he
 could understand, it had been like asking an African pygmy, armed with
 a blowgun, to set up shop in the midst of a herd of wild elephants. It
 simply wasn't feasible—and furthermore he derived an impression of the
 tenuosity as well as the immovability of the gateway itself.


 They could be hurt, even killed by humans in a three-dimensional world.
 How? Tennant did not know. Perhaps as a man can cut finger or even
 throat on the edge of a near-two-dimensional piece of paper. It took
 valor for them to hunt men in the world of men. In that fact lay a key
 to their character—if such utterly alien creatures could be said to
 have character.

""Get Gunther,"" the official orders read. It

 was to laugh! For Click and Irish were

 marooned on the pirate's asteroid—their only

 weapons a single gun and a news-reel camera.


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Planet Stories Spring 1944.

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

Suddenly, it was there. There wasn't time to blink or speak or get
 scared. Click Hathaway's camera was loaded and he stood there listening
 to it rack-spin film between his fingers, and he knew he was getting a
 damned sweet picture of everything that was happening.


 The picture of Marnagan hunched huge over the control-console,
 wrenching levers, jamming studs with freckled fists. And out in the
 dark of the fore-part there was space and a star-sprinkling and this
 meteor coming like blazing fury.


 Click Hathaway felt the ship move under him like a sensitive animal's
 skin. And then the meteor hit. It made a spiked fist and knocked the
 rear-jets flat, and the ship spun like a cosmic merry-go-round.


 There was plenty of noise. Too damned much. Hathaway only knew he was
 picked up and hurled against a lever-bank, and that Marnagan wasn't
 long in following, swearing loud words. Click remembered hanging on to
 his camera and gritting to keep holding it. What a sweet shot that had
 been of the meteor! A sweeter one still of Marnagan beating hell out of
 the controls and keeping his words to himself until just now.


 It got quiet. It got so quiet you could almost hear the asteroids
 rushing up, cold, blue and hard. You could hear your heart kicking a
 tom-tom between your sick stomach and your empty lungs.


 Stars, asteroids revolved. Click grabbed Marnagan because he was the
 nearest thing, and held on. You came hunting for a space-raider and you
 ended up cradled in a slab-sized Irishman's arms, diving at a hunk of
 metal death. What a fade-out!


 ""Irish!"" he heard himself say. ""Is this IT?""


 ""Is this
what
?"" yelled Marnagan inside his helmet.


 ""Is this where the Big Producer yells CUT!?""


 Marnagan fumed. ""I'll die when I'm damned good and ready. And when I'm
 ready I'll inform you and you can picture me profile for Cosmic Films!""


 They both waited, thrust against the shipside and held by a hand of
 gravity; listening to each other's breathing hard in the earphones.


 The ship struck, once. Bouncing, it struck again. It turned end over
 and stopped. Hathaway felt himself grabbed; he and Marnagan rattled
 around—human dice in a croupier's cup. The shell of the ship burst,
 air and energy flung out.


 Hathaway screamed the air out of his lungs, but his brain was thinking
 quick crazy, unimportant things. The best scenes in life never reach
 film, or an audience. Like this one, dammit! Like
this
one! His
 brain spun, racketing like the instantaneous, flicking motions of his
 camera.
Silence came and engulfed all the noise, ate it up and swallowed it.
 Hathaway shook his head, instinctively grabbed at the camera locked
 to his mid-belt. There was nothing but stars, twisted wreckage, cold
 that pierced through his vac-suit, and silence. He wriggled out of the
 wreckage into that silence.


 He didn't know what he was doing until he found the camera in his
 fingers as if it had grown there when he was born. He stood there,
 thinking ""Well, I'll at least have a few good scenes on film. I'll—""


 A hunk of metal teetered, fell with a crash. Marnagan elevated seven
 feet of bellowing manhood from the wreck.


 ""Hold it!"" cracked Hathaway's high voice. Marnagan froze. The camera
 whirred. ""Low angle shot; Interplanetary Patrolman emerges unscathed
 from asteroid crackup. Swell stuff. I'll get a raise for this!""


 ""From the toe of me boot!"" snarled Marnagan brusquely. Oxen shoulders
 flexed inside his vac-suit. ""I might've died in there, and you nursin'
 that film-contraption!""


 Hathaway felt funny inside, suddenly. ""I never thought of that.
 Marnagan die? I just took it for granted you'd come through. You always
 have. Funny, but you don't think about dying. You try not to."" Hathaway
 stared at his gloved hand, but the gloving was so thick and heavy he
 couldn't tell if it was shaking. Muscles in his bony face went down,
 pale. ""Where are we?""


 ""A million miles from nobody.""


 They stood in the middle of a pocked, time-eroded meteor plain that
 stretched off, dipping down into silent indigo and a rash of stars.
 Overhead, the sun poised; black and stars all around it, making it look
 sick.


 ""If we walk in opposite directions, Click Hathaway, we'd be shaking
 hands the other side of this rock in two hours."" Marnagan shook his mop
 of dusty red hair. ""And I promised the boys at Luna Base this time I'd
 capture that Gunther lad!""


 His voice stopped and the silence spoke.


 Hathaway felt his heart pumping slow, hot pumps of blood. ""I checked
 my oxygen, Irish. Sixty minutes of breathing left.""


 The silence punctuated that sentence, too. Upon the sharp meteoric
 rocks Hathaway saw the tangled insides of the radio, the food supply
 mashed and scattered. They were lucky to have escaped. Or
was
suffocation a better death...?
Sixty minutes.
They stood and looked at one another.


 ""Damn that meteor!"" said Marnagan, hotly.


 Hathaway got hold of an idea; remembering something. He said it out:
 ""Somebody tossed that meteor, Irish. I took a picture of it, looked
 it right in the eye when it rolled at us, and it was poker-hot.
 Space-meteors are never hot and glowing. If it's proof you want, I've
 got it here, on film.""


 Marnagan winced his freckled square of face. ""It's not proof we need
 now, Click. Oxygen. And then
food
. And then some way back to Earth.""


 Hathaway went on saying his thoughts: ""This is Gunther's work. He's
 here somewhere, probably laughing his guts out at the job he did us.
 Oh, God, this would make great news-release stuff if we ever get back
 to Earth. I.P.'s Irish Marnagan, temporarily indisposed by a pirate
 whose dirty face has never been seen, Gunther by name, finally wins
 through to a triumphant finish. Photographed on the spot, in color, by
 yours truly, Click Hathaway. Cosmic Films, please notice.""
They started walking, fast, over the pocked, rubbled plain toward a
 bony ridge of metal. They kept their eyes wide and awake. There wasn't
 much to see, but it was better than standing still, waiting.


 Marnagan said, ""We're working on margin, and we got nothin' to sweat
 with except your suspicions about this not being an accident. We got
 fifty minutes to prove you're right. After that—right or wrong—you'll
 be Cosmic Films prettiest unmoving, unbreathin' genius. But talk all
 you like, Click. It's times like this when we all need words, any
 words, on our tongues. You got your camera and your scoop. Talk about
 it. As for me—"" he twisted his glossy red face. ""Keeping alive is me
 hobby. And this sort of two-bit death I did not order.""


 Click nodded. ""Gunther knows how you'd hate dying this way, Irish.
 It's irony clean through. That's probably why he planned the meteor and
 the crash this way.""


 Marnagan said nothing, but his thick lips went down at the corners, far
 down, and the green eyes blazed.


 They stopped, together.


 ""Oops!"" Click said.


 ""Hey!"" Marnagan blinked. ""Did you feel
that
?""


 Hathaway's body felt feathery, light as a whisper, boneless and
 limbless, suddenly. ""Irish! We lost weight, coming over that ridge!""


 They ran back. ""Let's try it again.""


 They tried it. They scowled at each other. The same thing happened.
 ""Gravity should not act this way, Click.""


 ""Are you telling me? It's man-made. Better than that—it's Gunther! No
 wonder we fell so fast—we were dragged down by a super-gravity set-up!
 Gunther'd do anything to—did I say
anything
?""


 Hathaway leaped backward in reaction. His eyes widened and his hand
 came up, jabbing. Over a hill-ridge swarmed a brew of unbelievable
 horrors. Progeny from Frankenstein's ARK. Immense crimson beasts with
 numerous legs and gnashing mandibles, brown-black creatures, some
 tubular and fat, others like thin white poisonous whips slashing along
 in the air. Fangs caught starlight white on them.


 Hathaway yelled and ran, Marnagan at his heels, lumbering. Sweat broke
 cold on his body. The immense things rolled, slithered and squirmed
 after him. A blast of light. Marnagan, firing his proton-gun. Then, in
 Click's ears, the Irishman's incredulous bellow. The gun didn't hurt
 the creatures at all.


 ""Irish!"" Hathaway flung himself over the ridge, slid down an incline
 toward the mouth a small cave. ""This way, fella!""


 Hathaway made it first, Marnagan bellowing just behind him. ""They're
 too big; they can't get us in here!"" Click's voice gasped it out,
 as Marnagan squeezed his two-hundred-fifty pounds beside him.
 Instinctively, Hathaway added, ""Asteroid monsters! My camera! What a
 scene!""


 ""Damn your damn camera!"" yelled Marnagan. ""They might come in!""


 ""Use your gun.""


 ""They got impervious hides. No use. Gahh! And that was a pretty chase,
 eh, Click?""


 ""Yeah. Sure.
You
enjoyed it, every moment of it.""


 ""I did that."" Irish grinned, showing white uneven teeth. ""Now, what
 will we be doing with these uninvited guests at our door?""


 ""Let me think—""


 ""Lots of time, little man. Forty more minutes of air, to be exact.""
They sat, staring at the monsters for about a minute. Hathaway felt
 funny about something; didn't know what. Something about these monsters
 and Gunther and—


 ""Which one will you be having?"" asked Irish, casually. ""A red one or a
 blue one?""


 Hathaway laughed nervously. ""A pink one with yellow ruffles—Good God,
 now you've got
me
doing it. Joking in the face of death.""


 ""Me father taught me; keep laughing and you'll have Irish luck.""


 That didn't please the photographer. ""I'm an Anglo-Swede,"" he pointed
 out.


 Marnagan shifted uneasily. ""Here, now. You're doing nothing but
 sitting, looking like a little boy locked in a bedroom closet, so take
 me a profile shot of the beasties and myself.""


 Hathaway petted his camera reluctantly. ""What in hell's the use? All
 this swell film shot. Nobody'll ever see it.""


 ""Then,"" retorted Marnagan, ""we'll develop it for our own benefit; while
 waitin' for the U.S. Cavalry to come riding over the hill to our
 rescue!""


 Hathaway snorted. ""U.S. Cavalry.""


 Marnagan raised his proton-gun dramatically. ""Snap me this pose,"" he
 said. ""I paid your salary to trot along, photographing, we hoped,
 my capture of Gunther, now the least you can do is record peace
 negotiations betwixt me and these pixies.""


 Marnagan wasn't fooling anybody. Hathaway knew the superficial palaver
 for nothing but a covering over the fast, furious thinking running
 around in that red-cropped skull. Hathaway played the palaver, too, but
 his mind was whirring faster than his camera as he spun a picture of
 Marnagan standing there with a useless gun pointed at the animals.


 Montage. Marnagan sitting, chatting at the monsters. Marnagan smiling
 for the camera. Marnagan in profile. Marnagan looking grim, without
 much effort, for the camera. And then, a closeup of the thrashing death
 wall that holed them in. Click took them all, those shots, not saying
 anything. Nobody fooled nobody with this act. Death was near and they
 had sweaty faces, dry mouths and frozen guts.


 When Click finished filming, Irish sat down to save oxygen, and used it
 up arguing about Gunther. Click came back at him:


 ""Gunther drew us down here, sure as Ceres! That gravity change we felt
 back on that ridge, Irish; that proves it. Gunther's short on men. So,
 what's he do; he builds an asteroid-base, and drags ships down. Space
 war isn't perfect yet, guns don't prime true in space, trajectory
 is lousy over long distances. So what's the best weapon, which
 dispenses with losing valuable, rare ships and a small bunch of men?
 Super-gravity and a couple of well-tossed meteors. Saves all around.
 It's a good front, this damned iron pebble. From it, Gunther strikes
 unseen; ships simply crash, that's all. A subtle hand, with all aces.""


 Marnagan rumbled. ""Where is the dirty son, then!""


 ""He didn't have to appear, Irish. He sent—them."" Hathaway nodded at
 the beasts. ""People crashing here die from air-lack, no food, or from
 wounds caused at the crackup. If they survive all that—the animals
 tend to them. It all looks like Nature was responsible. See how subtle
 his attack is? Looks like accidental death instead of murder, if the
 Patrol happens to land and finds us. No reason for undue investigation,
 then.""


 ""I don't see no Base around.""
Click shrugged. ""Still doubt it? Okay. Look."" He tapped his camera and
 a spool popped out onto his gloved palm. Holding it up, he stripped
 it out to its full twenty inch length, held it to the light while it
 developed, smiling. It was one of his best inventions. Self-developing
 film. The first light struck film-surface, destroyed one chemical,
 leaving imprints; the second exposure simply hardened, secured the
 impressions. Quick stuff.


 Inserting the film-tongue into a micro-viewer in the camera's base,
 Click handed the whole thing over. ""Look.""


 Marnagan put the viewer up against the helmet glass, squinted. ""Ah,
 Click. Now, now. This is one lousy film you invented.""


 ""Huh?""


 ""It's a strange process'll develop my picture and ignore the asteroid
 monsters complete.""


 ""What!""


 Hathaway grabbed the camera, gasped, squinted, and gasped again:
 Pictures in montage; Marnagan sitting down, chatting conversationally
 with
nothing
; Marnagan shooting his gun at
nothing
; Marnagan
 pretending to be happy in front of
nothing
.


 Then, closeup—of—NOTHING!


 The monsters had failed to image the film. Marnagan was there, his hair
 like a red banner, his freckled face with the blue eyes bright in it.
 Maybe—


 Hathaway said it, loud: ""Irish! Irish! I think I see a way out of this
 mess! Here—""


 He elucidated it over and over again to the Patrolman. About the film,
 the beasts, and how the film couldn't be wrong. If the film said the
 monsters weren't there, they weren't there.


 ""Yeah,"" said Marnagan. ""But step outside this cave—""


 ""If my theory is correct I'll do it, unafraid,"" said Click.


 Marnagan scowled. ""You sure them beasts don't radiate ultra-violet or
 infra-red or something that won't come out on film?""


 ""Nuts! Any color
we
see, the camera sees. We've been fooled.""


 ""Hey, where
you
going?"" Marnagan blocked Hathaway as the smaller man
 tried pushing past him.


 ""Get out of the way,"" said Hathaway.


 Marnagan put his big fists on his hips. ""If anyone is going anywhere,
 it'll be me does the going.""


 ""I can't let you do that, Irish.""


 ""Why not?""


 ""You'd be going on my say-so.""


 ""Ain't your say-so good enough for me?""


 ""Yes. Sure. Of course. I guess—""


 ""If you say them animals ain't there, that's all I need. Now, stand
 aside, you film-developing flea, and let an Irishman settle their
 bones."" He took an unnecessary hitch in trousers that didn't exist
 except under an inch of porous metal plate. ""Your express purpose on
 this voyage, Hathaway, is taking films to be used by the Patrol later
 for teaching Junior Patrolmen how to act in tough spots. First-hand
 education. Poke another spool of film in that contraption and give me
 profile a scan. This is lesson number seven: Daniel Walks Into The
 Lion's Den.""


 ""Irish, I—""


 ""Shut up and load up.""


 Hathaway nervously loaded the film-slot, raised it.


 ""Ready, Click?""


 ""I—I guess so,"" said Hathaway. ""And remember, think it hard, Irish.
 Think it hard. There aren't any animals—""


 ""Keep me in focus, lad.""


 ""All the way, Irish.""


 ""What do they say...? Oh, yeah. Action. Lights. Camera!""


 Marnagan held his gun out in front of him and still smiling took one,
 two, three, four steps out into the outside world. The monsters were
 waiting for him at the fifth step. Marnagan kept walking.


 Right out into the middle of them....
That was the sweetest shot Hathaway ever took. Marnagan and the
 monsters!


 Only now it was only Marnagan.


 No more monsters.


 Marnagan smiled a smile broader than his shoulders. ""Hey, Click, look
 at me! I'm in one piece. Why, hell, the damned things turned tail and
 ran away!""


 ""Ran, hell!"" cried Hathaway, rushing out, his face flushed and
 animated. ""They just plain vanished. They were only imaginative
 figments!""


 ""And to think we let them hole us in that way, Click Hathaway, you
 coward!""


 ""Smile when you say that, Irish.""


 ""Sure, and ain't I always smilin'? Ah, Click boy, are them tears in
 your sweet grey eyes?""


 ""Damn,"" swore the photographer, embarrassedly. ""Why don't they put
 window-wipers in these helmets?""


 ""I'll take it up with the Board, lad.""


 ""Forget it. I was so blamed glad to see your homely carcass in one
 hunk, I couldn't help—Look, now, about Gunther. Those animals are part
 of his set-up. Explorers who land here inadvertently, are chased back
 into their ships, forced to take off. Tourists and the like. Nothing
 suspicious about animals. And if the tourists don't leave, the animals
 kill them.""


 ""Shaw, now. Those animals can't kill.""


 ""Think not, Mr. Marnagan? As long as we believed in them they could
 have frightened us to death, forced us, maybe, to commit suicide. If
 that isn't being dangerous—""


 The Irishman whistled.


 ""But, we've got to
move
, Irish. We've got twenty minutes of oxygen.
 In that time we've got to trace those monsters to their source,
 Gunther's Base, fight our way in, and get fresh oxy-cannisters."" Click
 attached his camera to his mid-belt. ""Gunther probably thinks we're
 dead by now. Everyone else's been fooled by his playmates; they never
 had a chance to disbelieve them.""


 ""If it hadn't been for you taking them pictures, Click—""


 ""Coupled with your damned stubborn attitude about the accident—"" Click
 stopped and felt his insides turning to water. He shook his head and
 felt a film slip down over his eyes. He spread his legs out to steady
 himself, and swayed. ""I—I don't think my oxygen is as full as yours.
 This excitement had me double-breathing and I feel sick.""


 Marnagan's homely face grimaced in sympathy. ""Hold tight, Click. The
 guy that invented these fish-bowls didn't provide for a sick stomach.""


 ""Hold tight, hell, let's move. We've got to find where those animals
 came from! And the only way to do that is to get the animals to come
 back!""


 ""Come back? How?""


 ""They're waiting, just outside the aura of our thoughts, and if we
 believe in them again, they'll return.""


 Marnagan didn't like it. ""Won't—won't they kill us—if they come—if
 we believe in 'em?""


 Hathaway shook a head that was tons heavy and weary. ""Not if we believe
 in them to a
certain point
. Psychologically they can both be seen and
 felt. We only want to
see
them coming at us again.""


 ""
Do
we, now?""


 ""With twenty minutes left, maybe less—""


 ""All right, Click, let's bring 'em back. How do we do it?""


 Hathaway fought against the mist in his eyes. ""Just think—I will see
 the monsters again. I will see them again and I will not feel them.
 Think it over and over.""


 Marnagan's hulk stirred uneasily. ""And—what if I forget to remember
 all that? What if I get excited...?""


 Hathaway didn't answer. But his eyes told the story by just looking at
 Irish.


 Marnagan cursed. ""All right, lad. Let's have at it!""


 The monsters returned.
A soundless deluge of them, pouring over the rubbled horizon, swarming
 in malevolent anticipation about the two men.


 ""This way, Irish. They come from this way! There's a focal point, a
 sending station for these telepathic brutes. Come on!""


 Hathaway sludged into the pressing tide of color, mouths, contorted
 faces, silvery fat bodies misting as he plowed through them.
Marnagan was making good progress ahead of Hathaway. But he stopped and
 raised his gun and made quick moves with it. ""Click! This one here!
 It's real!"" He fell back and something struck him down. His immense
 frame slammed against rock, noiselessly.


 Hathaway darted forward, flung his body over Marnagan's, covered the
 helmet glass with his hands, shouting:


 ""Marnagan! Get a grip, dammit! It's not real—don't let it force into
 your mind! It's not real, I tell you!""


 ""Click—"" Marnagan's face was a bitter, tortured movement behind glass.
 ""Click—"" He was fighting hard. ""I—I—sure now. Sure—"" He smiled.
 ""It—it's only a shanty fake!""


 ""Keep saying it, Irish. Keep it up.""


 Marnagan's thick lips opened. ""It's only a fake,"" he said. And then,
 irritated, ""Get the hell off me, Hathaway. Let me up to my feet!""


 Hathaway got up, shakily. The air in his helmet smelled stale, and
 little bubbles danced in his eyes. ""Irish,
you
forget the monsters.
 Let me handle them, I know how. They might fool you again, you might
 forget.""


 Marnagan showed his teeth. ""Gah! Let a flea have all the fun? And
 besides, Click, I like to look at them. They're pretty.""


 The outpour of animals came from a low lying mound a mile farther on.
 Evidently the telepathic source lay there. They approached it warily.


 ""We'll be taking our chances on guard,"" hissed Irish. ""I'll go ahead,
 draw their attention, maybe get captured. Then,
you
show up with
your
gun....""


 ""I haven't got one.""


 ""We'll chance it, then. You stick here until I see what's ahead. They
 probably got scanners out. Let them see me—""


 And before Hathaway could object, Marnagan walked off. He walked about
 five hundred yards, bent down, applied his fingers to something, heaved
 up, and there was a door opening in the rock.


 His voice came back across the distance, into Click's earphones. ""A
 door, an air-lock, Click. A tunnel leading down inside!""


 Then, Marnagan dropped into the tunnel, disappearing. Click heard the
 thud of his feet hitting the metal flooring.


 Click sucked in his breath, hard and fast.


 ""All right, put 'em up!"" a new harsh voice cried over a different
 radio. One of Gunther's guards.


 Three shots sizzled out, and Marnagan bellowed.


 The strange harsh voice said, ""That's better. Don't try and pick that
 gun up now. Oh, so it's you. I thought Gunther had finished you off.
 How'd you get past the animals?""


 Click started running. He switched off his
sending
audio, kept his
receiving
on. Marnagan, weaponless.
One
guard. Click gasped. Things
 were getting dark. Had to have air. Air. Air. He ran and kept running
 and listening to Marnagan's lying voice:


 ""I tied them pink elephants of Gunther's in neat alphabetical bundles
 and stacked them up to dry, ya louse!"" Marnagan said. ""But, damn you,
 they killed my partner before he had a chance!""


 The guard laughed.
The air-lock door was still wide open when Click reached it, his head
 swimming darkly, his lungs crammed with pain-fire and hell-rockets. He
 let himself down in, quiet and soft. He didn't have a weapon. He didn't
 have a weapon. Oh, damn, damn!


 A tunnel curved, ending in light, and two men silhouetted in that
 yellow glare. Marnagan, backed against a wall, his helmet cracked,
 air hissing slowly out of it, his face turning blue. And the guard, a
 proton gun extended stiffly before him, also in a vac-suit. The guard
 had his profile toward Hathaway, his lips twisting: ""I think I'll let
 you stand right there and die,"" he said quietly. ""That what Gunther
 wanted, anway. A nice sordid death.""


 Hathaway took three strides, his hands out in front of him.


 ""Don't move!"" he snapped. ""I've got a weapon stronger than yours. One
 twitch and I'll blast you and the whole damned wall out from behind
 you! Freeze!""


 The guard whirled. He widened his sharp eyes, and reluctantly, dropped
 his gun to the floor.


 ""Get his gun, Irish.""


 Marnagan made as if to move, crumpled clumsily forward.


 Hathaway ran in, snatched up the gun, smirked at the guard. ""Thanks for
 posing,"" he said. ""That shot will go down in film history for candid
 acting.""


 ""What!""


 ""Ah: ah! Keep your place. I've got a real gun now. Where's the door
 leading into the Base?""


 The guard moved his head sullenly over his left shoulder.


 Click was afraid he would show his weak dizziness. He needed air.
 ""Okay. Drag Marnagan with you, open the door and we'll have air. Double
 time! Double!""


 Ten minutes later, Marnagan and Hathaway, fresh tanks of oxygen on
 their backs, Marnagan in a fresh bulger and helmet, trussed the guard,
 hid him in a huge trash receptacle. ""Where he belongs,"" observed Irish
 tersely.


 They found themselves in a complete inner world; an asteroid nothing
 more than a honey-comb fortress sliding through the void unchallenged.
 Perfect front for a raider who had little equipment and was
 short-handed of men. Gunther simply waited for specific cargo ships to
 rocket by, pulled them or knocked them down and swarmed over them for
 cargo. The animals served simply to insure against suspicion and the
 swarms of tourists that filled the void these days. Small fry weren't
 wanted. They were scared off.


 The telepathic sending station for the animals was a great bank of
 intricate, glittering machine, through which strips of colored film
 with images slid into slots and machine mouths that translated them
 into thought-emanations. A damned neat piece of genius.


 ""So here we are, still not much better off than we were,"" growled
 Irish. ""We haven't a ship or a space-radio, and more guards'll turn
 up any moment. You think we could refocus this doohingey, project the
 monsters inside the asteroid to fool the pirates themselves?""


 ""What good would that do?"" Hathaway gnawed his lip. ""They wouldn't fool
 the engineers who created them, you nut.""


 Marnagan exhaled disgustedly. ""Ah, if only the U.S. Cavalry would come
 riding over the hill—""
""Irish!"" Hathaway snapped that, his face lighting up. ""Irish. The U.S.
 Cavalry it is!"" His eyes darted over the machines. ""Here. Help me.
 We'll stage everything on the most colossal raid of the century.""


 Marnagan winced. ""You breathing oxygen or whiskey?""


 ""There's only one stipulation I make, Irish. I want a complete picture
 of Marnagan capturing Raider's Base. I want a picture of Gunther's face
 when you do it. Snap it, now, we've got rush work to do. How good an
 actor are you?""


 ""That's a silly question.""


 ""You only have to do three things. Walk with your gun out in front of
 you, firing. That's number one. Number two is to clutch at your heart
 and fall down dead. Number three is to clutch at your side, fall down
 and twitch on the ground. Is that clear?""


 ""Clear as the Coal Sack Nebula....""


 An hour later Hathaway trudged down a passageway that led out into a
 sort of city street inside the asteroid. There were about six streets,
 lined with cube houses in yellow metal, ending near Hathaway in a
 wide, green-lawned Plaza.


 Hathaway, weaponless, idly carrying his camera in one hand, walked
 across the Plaza as if he owned it. He was heading for a building that
 was pretentious enough to be Gunther's quarters.


 He got halfway there when he felt a gun in his back.


 He didn't resist. They took him straight ahead to his destination and
 pushed him into a room where Gunther sat.


 Hathaway looked at him. ""So you're Gunther?"" he said, calmly. The
 pirate was incredibly old, his bulging forehead stood out over sunken,
 questioningly dark eyes, and his scrawny body was lost in folds of
 metal-link cloth. He glanced up from a paper-file, surprised. Before he
 could speak, Hathaway said:


 ""Everything's over with, Mr. Gunther. The Patrol is in the city now and
 we're capturing your Base. Don't try to fight. We've a thousand men
 against your eighty-five.""


 Gunther sat there, blinking at Hathaway, not moving. His thin hands
 twitched in his lap. ""You are bluffing,"" he said, finally, with a firm
 directness. ""A ship hasn't landed here for an hour. Your ship was the
 last. Two people were on it. The last I saw of them they were being
 pursued to the death by the Beasts. One of you escaped, it seemed.""


 ""Both. The other guy went after the Patrol.""


 ""Impossible!""


 ""I can't respect your opinion, Mr. Gunther.""


 A shouting rose from the Plaza. About fifty of Gunther's men, lounging
 on carved benches during their time-off, stirred to their feet and
 started yelling. Gunther turned slowly to the huge window in one side
 of his office. He stared, hard.


 The Patrol was coming!


 Across the Plaza, marching quietly and decisively, came the Patrol.
 Five hundred Patrolmen in one long, incredible line, carrying paralysis
 guns with them in their tight hands.


 Gunther babbled like a child, his voice a shrill dagger in the air.
 ""Get out there, you men! Throw them back! We're outnumbered!""


 Guns flared. But the Patrol came on. Gunther's men didn't run, Hathaway
 had to credit them on that. They took it, standing.


 Hathaway chuckled inside, deep. What a sweet, sweet shot this was.
 His camera whirred, clicked and whirred again. Nobody stopped him
 from filming it. Everything was too wild, hot and angry. Gunther was
 throwing a fit, still seated at his desk, unable to move because of his
 fragile, bony legs and their atrophied state.


 Some of the Patrol were killed. Hathaway chuckled again as he saw three
 of the Patrolmen clutch at their hearts, crumple, lie on the ground and
 twitch. God, what photography!


 Gunther raged, and swept a small pistol from his linked corselet. He
 fired wildly until Hathaway hit him over the head with a paper-weight.
 Then Hathaway took a picture of Gunther slumped at his desk, the chaos
 taking place immediately outside his window.


 The pirates broke and fled, those that were left. A mere handful. And
 out of the chaos came Marnagan's voice, ""Here!""

It's my first go at delivering a baby by caesarean section – and the foetal head is impacted, jammed in its mother's pelvis. To be honest I'm struggling. 

 Incisions have been made in the lower part of the mother's abdomen and womb. I've pushed my gloved hand inside and managed to slide my fingers between the baby's head and the surrounding uterine tissue. But it's difficult. The baby is tightly wedged in. I've had to push hard to get my hand to the far side of its head, and even though I'm now cupping and grasping it in the approved manner, I can't seem to pull it out. Dare I grip its head more firmly? Dare I pull harder?  

 The baby's mother – she's called Debra – remains impassive throughout these agonised fumblings. Her face reveals nothing of what she may be feeling. But then Debra has no feelings. Indeed she has no face…  

 So you can stop worrying. Debra – Desperate Debra to use her full trade name – is a simulator designed to help doctors practise their skill at dealing with impacted foetuses: babies that get stuck trying to exit the womb by the normal route. She comprises the lower two thirds (ie from the mid-chest region downwards) of a life-sized but limbless female torso made of flesh-coloured silicone rubber. She comes with a vulva, a pre-cut incision in her abdomen and, most importantly, a uterus containing a foetal head that should, in the normal way of things, be free to emerge between her legs. But this fetus is going nowhere until an obstetrician – or in this case me – can successfully grasp and pull it out.  

 The clever and sophisticated simulator I'm playing with started life as a lash-up in an obstetrician's home workshop: a Heath Robinson-style contraption barely recognisable as a model of the human body. But it wasn't at that stage intended as a simulator for training medical staff. Its sole purpose was to test the effectiveness of a novel device called a Tydeman tube. Paradoxically, although the testing equipment, Debra, is now commercially available, the device it was intended to test has yet to reach the market. 

 The inventor of the tube and of Desperate Debra is Dr Graham Tydeman, a consultant in obstetrics and gynaecology at Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, Fife. Only after he'd built Debra did he realise that she might serve a purpose beyond his original intention. His is a decade-long tale of inspired insights, thwarted aims and shifting purposes; but with a good outcome. Although the Tydeman tube is still in gestation, Desperate Debra herself is now thriving.
To understand the desperation of Debra and how the Tydeman tube might help to relieve it requires a brief foray into basic obstetric knowhow.  Evolution has endowed us with heads proportionally so large that even when labour runs according to plan, the delivery process involves a bit of a squeeze. For the baby's head to get stuck on the way out may not be usual, but it's by no means a rarity. 

 The standard response is to perform a caesarean section. Every year some 160,000 babies are born in the UK this way, with almost two thirds of them classified as emergencies. One audit has suggested that roughly 8,000 babies get stuck and have to be delivered by caesarean at a stage when their mothers are fully dilated. ""Some of the babies will be so close to coming out by the normal route,"" says Tydeman, ""that it's then difficult to get them back up and remove them through the hole in the woman's tummy."" Which women are most at risk of this setback seems to be largely unpredictable. ""We just observe that it happens… It's been discussed in the medical literature since the 1940s, but until 10 years ago, and throughout my training and most of my life as a consultant, it wasn't really talked about.""
Considering the universality of childbirth, impaction and the best way of dealing with it are topics that seem to have gone remarkably unstudied. ""There are strong opinions about why it happens and what to do, but very little research evidence,"" says Tydeman, adding that many of these opinions are contradictory. 

 In a protracted birth that's destined to end with a caesarean, the longer the labour is allowed to go on before the obstetrician decides to intervene, the greater the likelihood that the baby's head will become impacted. However, concern over the rising number of babies born by caesarean has made doctors more wary of doing them – one consequence of which is that medical staff may allow a difficult birth to continue for longer before they resort to surgery. This could be boosting the frequency of impaction. But, again, no one is certain. 

 When obstetricians doing planned caesareans slice open a mother's womb, what they usually see is the baby's head. By slipping a hand round and below it they can easily guide the baby out. ""When you do a caesarean for an impacted baby,"" says Tydeman, ""you make the incision in the same place, but what you might come across is a shoulder because the baby's so much further down [the birth canal]."" As I'd discovered for myself, sliding a hand around the baby's head is then far more difficult. ""It makes your fingers hurt,"" says Tydeman. ""It makes your pulse rate go up to about 200, and you break out in a sweat because know you've only got about five or 10 minutes before there are serious consequences. The clock is ticking."" 

 If a baby's head is jammed down in the mother's pelvic region, common sense suggests that it might help if a second person gives a gentle backward push on the area of its head visible through the mother's dilated cervix. ""In our unit,"" says Tydeman, ""when the woman is fully dilated and you'd expect the baby to come out normally [but it doesn't]… a registrar will be asking for a push-up about one in five times."" Although registrars are doctors still in training, they're nonetheless experienced; which suggests requests for push-ups during unplanned caesareans are far from uncommon. The Tydeman tube is a gadget intended to make this manoeuvre safer and more effective.
Creativity and innovation have many unlikely sources. What seems to have inspired Tydeman to develop his device was the characteristic sound of a Wellington boot being pulled free of wet, muddy ground: a slurpy, sucking, gurgling noise. When an impacted foetal head is pulled free of the uterus it's often accompanied by a similar sucking noise, the result of air rushing in between the obstetrician's fingers to fill the space vacated. ""What occurred to me years ago was that if the air can't get in, why not put a tube up into the vagina so that it can get in from below the baby's head."" From time to time, if he felt he felt the baby might stick, Tydeman would slip a length of sterile silicone tubing through the woman's vagina and up into the womb next to the baby's head. Allowing air in by this route would release any suction forces tending to hold it where it was. 

 Tydeman didn't do much with the idea until 10 years ago when one trainee, who was experiencing real difficulty getting heads out, prompted him to think again about the problem. Around the same time, he met professor of obstetrics Andrew Shennan and consultant midwife Annette Briley, both of the Women's Health Academic Centre at St Thomas's hospital. Between them they came up with a device – the Tydeman tube – to make pushing on the foetus more controlled while simultaneously releasing any vacuum that might be holding it in place. 

 The instrument is made up of a rigid plastic tube opening into a softer silicone cup. Pressure to the foetal head is applied using four pads projecting forward from the cup's interior. Holding the device by the tube, the user places the cup against the part of the head exposed through the dilated cervix, and presses. This pushes the baby back up into the uterus while releasing any suction pressure that may have been holding it, so allowing the obstetrician to extract it more easily. Because pressure is distributed equally between the four pads with a greater combined surface area than that of a user's fingertips, the risk of inadvertent damage is minimised. 

 The team found some money to employ a product designer who used computer-aided design technology and 3D printing to make a prototype. ""We were at the point of getting one made in silicone,"" says Tydeman, ""when we realised that before we started experimenting on women we really ought to test it on a simulator."" No such simulator existed – so he decided to make one himself. 

 That Tydeman was able to do this comes as no great surprise once you've glanced at his website. His career may be rooted in medicine but his interests encompass sculpture, furniture making and much else. He works in wood, glass, metals and plastic. ""I've got a big workshop with a lathe and a forge,"" he says. ""I make stuff. I always have, ever since I was a child. My dad was a woodwork teacher, my mum was very creative with fabric.""
Although tests carried out with the Debra prototype showed that the tube would work as intended, Tydeman and his colleagues then faced what he calls a kind of medical catch-22. ""We had the tube finished about three years ago… but we were more interested in trying to save lives than selling a product. We thought that the right thing to do before commercialising it was to be sure we'd got the best design."" They tried it on a dozen or so women in labour, and concluded that it did what it supposed to. But they held off trying to market it because they wanted to do more extensive, more rigorous clinical studies.
This presented a problem. ""If you've applied for research money,"" says Tydeman, ""but you've already got what seems to be a commercially viable design, potential funders are going to say that the company aiming to sell it should pay for the work."" On the other hand, commercial interest is easier to drum up if you've already got evidence that a device is safe and effective. 

 That said, the team didn't want to leave the tube sitting on the shelf. So they eventually decided to go ahead and find a commercial partner willing to manufacture and market it. They have now identified one, and are fairly confident it will soon be in production. With sufficient users it should then be possible to compile factual – as opposed to anecdotal – evidence of benefit. Not ideal, Tydeman concedes, but the best they can do at present. 

 In the meantime, back to Desperate Debra: so named, Tydeman says, not after any particular person but because the appellation is memorably alliterative. He put together the original Debra in a weekend. The skin was made out of a neoprene wetsuit fixed to a scaffolding formed from plastic tubing he'd found 20 years ago in skip outside a Glasgow pub; the head was cast in silicone from a model he'd made in plasticine, and the rest comprised old springs and other bits of stuff lying around his workshop. ""It wasn't actually that difficult,"" Tydeman says. 

 When originally conceived, remember, Debra was simply a means of testing the effectiveness of the tube. What she looked like was neither here nor there. It was only once Debra was reborn as a teaching aid that she needed sprucing up. 

 Tydeman can remember the exact moment when the idea of her having a greater role dawned on him. ""I was on the sleeper train down from Scotland to London,"" he says. ""Debra was with me because the first Tydeman tube had become available at St Thomas's… It was about midnight, I'd had my free whisky and I suddenly thought, 'Blow me! Even if the tube doesn't work, Debra could be useful as a teaching aid'.""
The following morning, at St Thomas's, Tydeman asked a visiting professor of obstetrics to have a look at Debra and tell him what she thought. She put her hand into Debra's womb, grasped the foetal head and said it felt just like the real thing. ""Terribly flattering,"" Tydeman laughs. 

 With a grant from the Guy's and St Thomas's Charity fund they made Debra more presentable. Tydeman showed the prototype to Adam Rouilly, an established company specialising in medical models and simulators. They were impressed. A year later, the first of Debra's smartened-up sisters was on the market. 

 In Debra as she is now, the precise extent and nature of her desperation can be fine-tuned according to need. The foetal head inside her uterus can be moved to mimic the various positions that an unborn baby may adopt. By tightening a spring inside Debra's body, it's also possible vary the degree of impaction from mild to so severe that the head is virtually impossible to extract. In this way she simulates the full range of difficulty that obstetricians are likely to encounter.   

 So how valuable in training medical staff is a simulator like this? Very, according to Annette Briley. Imagine it's the middle of the night and an unplanned emergency caesarean is required: ""Some poor junior doctor might find himself trying to manage it on his own."" To have practised the knack of extracting a firmly impacted baby from a simulator is lot better than first honing your skill on a real woman. 

 At St Thomas's, midwives in training also get an opportunity to practise on Debra. The chances that midwives will find themselves having to do the actual extraction of an infant are slim; but they're quite likely to be asked to help the obstetrician by pushing a stuck baby from below. Debra's anatomy allows them to practise this skill; and to learn where and how hard to push on the infant skull. ""Any practice you've done in the cold light of day will help you stay calm and composed in an emergency, and that's what we're aiming for,"" says Briley.
It's still too soon to make a final judgement about Debra’s impact. ""When we first brought Debra out,"" Briley recalls, ""some of the really experienced professors said things like, 'We always managed without one. Why would you need this?' But ask them to have a go at using it and then they admit it's really good."" Medicine as a whole has an oddly ambivalent relationship to innovation. Some new findings, techniques or equipment take years to penetrate the profession; others are seized upon immediately. 

 A proper study of the clinical effectiveness of the Tydeman tube will necessarily involve women giving birth. Assessing the value of Debra as a simulator didn't require human subjects; and the team has already conducted such a study. Thirty obstetricians, from three NHS maternity units and with varying levels of experience, took part. They all received a brief explanation of how Debra works, and were then asked to try a timed removal of the foetal head at three different levels of difficulty. Overall, 87 per cent reported that the simulator offered a realistic experience of dealing with an impacted head, and 93 per cent thought it would be valuable as a training device. 

 The use of simulators to teach technical skills is now common in medical schools. You can learn to sew up a knife wound, catheterise a bladder or intubate an airway. You can practise cardiopulmonary resuscitation or ear syringing or even go through the motions of a keyhole surgical procedure. The technology required to do these things may cost a few pounds, or tens of thousands. Either way, given that most of these devices were invented during the past three or four decades, it comes as something of a surprise to learn that simulation for medical purposes can be traced back as far as the Chinese Song dynasty of 960-1279 AD. 

 One of the treatments of choice in that era was, naturally, acupuncture. But how to teach tyro-acupuncturists where to place the needles? Simple. A life-size bronze statue dotted with small holes indicated the points of insertion. And how then to test the students' grasp of their subject? If the statute was hollow, filled with liquid and given an outer coating of wax to mask the holes, a correct needle insertion would be followed by a leak. 

 Given the universality of childbirth it's no surprise that, then as now, the womb turns out to be the most simulated of our organs. For the benefit of 18th-century midwives and doctors-in-training, the Bologna surgeon Giovanni Antonio Galli devised a birthing simulator comprising a glass uterus supported by an artificial pelvis and containing a flexible foetus. Trainees had to deliver the baby while wearing a blindfold. Only the tutor could witness the fumbling of their hands. 

 As the material for a convincing simulation, glass clearly has its drawbacks. But another 18th-century contraption used a pink cloth-covered mannequin comprising a female torso complete with genitalia, a set of implantable foetuses of various ages, and even – a real
coup de théâtre
, this – a facility for exuding suitably coloured liquids at the appropriate moment.
Oddly, as medicine became more scientific, most of these devices fell by the wayside. As an academic review of these and other devices has pointed out, much of the 20th century was something of Dark Ages for simulation. Its value in professional training has had to be rediscovered: an endeavour in which inventive people like Graham Tydeman, sometimes with workshops rich in discarded junk, are still fruitfully engaged.

By Bertrand L. Shurtleff
Radio is an absolute necessity in modern

 organization—and particularly in modern

 naval organization. If you could silence all

 radio—silence of that sort would be deadly!

The hurried
rat-a-tat
of knuckles hammered on the cabin door.
 Commander Bob Curtis roused himself from his doze, got up from his
 chair, stretched himself to his full, lanky height and yawned. That
 would be Nelson, his navigating officer. Nelson always knocked that
 way—like a man in an external state of jitters over nothing at all.


 Curtis didn't hurry. It pleased him to let Nelson wait. He moved slowly
 to the door, paused there, and flung a backward glance at the man in
 the cabin with him—Zukor Androka, the elderly Czech scientist, a guest
 of the United States navy, here aboard the cruiser
Comerford
.


 The wizened face of the older man was molded in intent lines of
 concentration, as his bushy gray head bent over his drawing board.
 Curtis got a glimpse of the design on which he was working, and his
 lips relaxed in a faint smile.


 Androka had arrived on board the
Comerford
the day before she sailed
 from Norfolk. With him came a boatload of scientific apparatus and
 equipment, including a number of things that looked like oxygen tanks,
 which were now stored in the forward hold. Androka had watched over
 his treasures with the jealous care of a mother hen, and spent hours
 daily in the room in the superstructure that had been assigned as his
 laboratory.


 Sometimes, Curtis thought old Androka was a bit wacky—a scientist
 whose mind had been turned by the horror that had come to his country
 under the domination of the Nazi
gestapo
. At other times, the man
 seemed a genius. Perhaps that was the answer—a mad genius!


 Curtis opened the door and looked out. Rain whipped against his face
 like a stinging wet lash. Overhead, the sky was a storm-racked mass of
 clouds, broken in one spot by a tiny patch of starlit blue.


 His eyes rested inquiringly on the face of the man who stood before
 him. It
was
Nelson, his shaggy blond brows drawn scowlingly down
 over his pale eyes; his thin face a mass of tense lines; his big hands
 fumbling at the neck of his slicker. Rain was coursing down his white
 cheeks, streaking them with glistening furrows.


 The fellow was a headache to Curtis. He was overfriendly with a
 black-browed bos'n's mate named Joe Bradford—the worst trouble maker
 on board. But there was no question of his ability. He was a good
 navigating officer—dependable, accurate, conscientious. Nevertheless,
 his taut face, restless, searching eyes, and eternally nervous manner
 got Curtis' goat.


 ""Come in, Nelson!"" he said.


 Nelson shouldered his way inside, and stood there in his dripping
 oilskins, blinking his eyes against the yellow light.


 Curtis closed the door and nodded toward the bent form of Zukor
 Androka, with a quizzical grin. ""Old Czech-and-Double-Czech is working
 hard on his latest invention to pull Hitler's teeth and re-establish
 the Czech Republic!""


 Nelson had no answering smile, although there had been a great deal
 of good-natured joking aboard the
Comerford
ever since the navy
 department had sent the scientist on board the cruiser to carry on his
 experiments.


 ""I'm worried, sir!"" Nelson said. ""I'm not sure about my dead reckoning.
 This storm—""


 Curtis threw his arm around Nelson's dripping shoulders. ""Forget it!
 Don't let a little error get you down!""


 ""But this storm, sir!"" Nelson avoided Curtis' friendly eyes and slipped
 out from under his arm. ""It's got me worried. Quartering wind of
 undetermined force, variable and gusty. There's a chop to the sea—as
 if from unestimated currents among the islets. No chance to check by
 observation, and now there is a chance—look at me!""


 He held out his hands. They were shaking as if he had the chills.


 ""You say there is a chance?"" Curtis asked. ""Stars out?""


 ""As if by providence, sir, there's a clear patch. I'm wondering—"" His
 voice trailed off, but his eyes swung toward the gleaming sextant on
 the rack.


 Commander Curtis shrugged good-naturedly and reached for the
 instrument. ""Not that I've lost confidence in you, Nels, but just
 because you asked for it!""
Curtis donned his slicker and went outside, sextant in hand. In a few
 minutes he returned and handed Nelson a sheet of paper with figures
 underlined heavily.


 ""Here's what I make it,"" the commander told his navigating officer.
 ""Bet you're not off appreciably.""


 Nelson stared at the computations with shaking head. Then he mutely
 held up his own.


 Curtis stared, frowned, grabbed his own sheet again. ""Any time I'm
 that far off old Figure-'em Nelson's estimate, I'm checking back,"" he
 declared, frowning at the two papers and hastily rechecking his own
 figures.


 ""Call up to the bridge to stop her,"" he told Nelson. ""We can't afford
 to move in these waters with such a possibility of error!""


 Nelson complied, and the throbbing drive of the engines lessened
 at once. Nelson said: ""I've been wondering, sir, if it wouldn't be
 advisable to try getting a radio cross-bearing. With all these rocks
 and islets—""


 ""Radio?"" repeated the little Czech, thrusting his face between the
 other two, in his independent fashion that ignored ship's discipline.
 ""You're using your radio?"" He broke into a knowing chuckle, his keen
 old eyes twinkling behind their thick lenses. ""Go ahead and try it. See
 how much you can get! It will be no more than Hitler can get when Zukor
 Androka decrees silence over the German airways! Try it! Try it, I say!""


 Bob Curtis stared at him, as if questioning his sanity. Then he
 hastened to the radio room, with Nelson at his heels, and the Czech
 trotting along behind.


 The door burst open as they neared it. A frightened operator came out,
 still wearing his earphones, and stood staring upward incredulously at
 the aërial.


 ""Get us a radio cross-bearing for location at once,"" Curtis said
 sharply, for the operator seemed in a daze.


 ""Bearing, sir?"" The man brought his eyes down with difficulty, as if
 still dissatisfied. ""I'm sorry, sir, but the outfit's dead. Went out on
 me about five minutes ago. I was taking the weather report when the set
 conked. I was trying to see if something's wrong.""


 The Czech inventor giggled. Curtis gave him another curious look and
 thrust himself into the radio room.


 ""Try again!"" he told the operator. ""See what you can get!""


 The radio man leaped to his seat and tried frantically. Again and
 again, he sent off a request for a cross-bearing from shore stations
 that had recently been established to insure safety to naval vessels,
 but there was no answer on any of the bands—not even the blare of a
 high-powered commercial program in the higher reach, nor the chatter of
 ships or amateurs on the shorter.


 ""Dead!"" Androka muttered, with a bitter laugh. ""Yet not dead,
 gentlemen! The set is uninjured. The waves are what have been upset. I
 have shattered them around your ship, just as I can eventually shatter
 them all over Central Europe! For the next two hours, no radio messages
 can enter or leave my zone of radio silence—of refracted radio waves,
 set up by my little station on one of the neighboring islets!""
There was a long pause, while commander and navigator stared at him.
 Curtis was the first to speak.


 ""Your secrecy might well cost the United States navy one of its best
 light cruisers—and us our lives!"" he said angrily. ""We need that check
 by radio at once! If you're not talking nonsense, call off your dogs
 till we learn just where we are!""


 Androka held out his palms helplessly. ""I can do nothing. I have given
 orders to my assistant that he must keep two hours of radio silence! I
 can get no message to him, for our radio is dead!""


 As if to mock him, the ship's radio began to answer:


 ""Station 297 calling U. S. Cruiser
Comerford
. Station 297 calling U.
 S. Cruiser
Comerford
—""


 ""U. S. Cruiser
Comerford
calling Station 297!"" the operator intoned,
 winking at the two officers over Androka's discomfiture, and asked for
 the bearings.


 The answer came back: ""Bearings north east by a quarter east, U. S.
 Cruiser
Comerford
!""


 Curtis sighed with relief. He saw that Nelson was staring fiercely
 at the radio operator, as the man went on calling: ""U. S. Cruiser
Comerford
calling Station 364. U. S. Cruiser
Comerford
calling
 Station 364—""


 Then the instrument rasped again: ""Station 364 calling U. S. Cruiser
Comerford
. Bearings north west by three west. Bearings north west by
 three west, U. S. Cruiser
Comerford
from Cay 364.""


 Commander and navigator had both scribbled verifications of the
 numbers. Ignoring the gibbering Androka, who was wailing his
 disappointment that messages had penetrated his veil of silence, they
 raced for the chart room.
Quickly the parallels stepped off the bearing from the designated
 points. Light intersecting lines proclaimed a check on their position.


 Curtis frowned and shook his head. Slowly he forced a reluctant grin as
 he stuck out his hand.


 ""Shake, Nels,"" he said. ""It's my turn to eat crow. You and the radio
 must be right. Continue as you were!""


 ""I'm relieved, sir, just the same,"" Nelson admitted, ""to have the radio
 bearings. We'd have piled up sure if you'd been right.""


 They went on through the night. The starlit gap in the clouds had
 closed. The sky was again a blanket of darkness pouring sheets of rain
 at them.


 Nelson went back to the bridge, and Androka returned to the commander's
 cabin. Curtis lingered in the wireless room with the radio operator.


 ""It's a funny thing,"" the latter said, still dialing and grousing, ""how
 I got that cross-bearing through and can't get another squeak out of
 her. I'm wondering if that old goat really
has
done something to the
 ether. The set seems O. K.""


 He lingered over the apparatus, checking and rechecking. Tubes lighted;
 wires were alive to the touch and set him to shaking his head at the
 tingle they sent through his inquiring fingers.


 Curtis left him at it, and went to rejoin Androka in the cabin. He
 found the little inventor pacing up and down, shaking his fists in the
 air; pausing every now and then to run his bony fingers through his
 tangled mop of gray hair, or to claw nervously at his beard.


 ""You have seen a miracle, commander!"" he shouted at Curtis. ""
My
miracle! My invention has shattered the ether waves hereabouts
 hopelessly.""


 ""Seems to me,"" Curtis said dryly, ""this invention can harm your friends
 as much as your enemies.""


 The scientist drew himself up to his full height—which was only a
 little over five feet. His voice grew shrill. ""Wait! Just wait! There
 are other inventions to supplement this one. Put them together, and
 they will defeat the Nazi hordes which have ravaged my country!""


 Curtis was a little shocked by the hatred that gleamed in Androka's
 eyes, under their bushy brows. There was something of the wild animal
 in the man's expression, as his lips drew back from his yellowed teeth.


 ""Those tanks you have below,"" Curtis said, ""have they some connection
 with this radio silence?""


 A far-away look came into Androka's eyes. He did not seem to hear
 the question. He lowered his voice: ""My daughter is still in Prague.
 So are my sister and her husband, and
their
two daughters. If the
gestapo
knew what I am doing, all of them would be better dead. You
 understand—better dead?""


 Curtis said: ""I understand.""


 ""And if the Nazi agents in America knew of the islet from which my zone
 of silence is projected—"" Androka paused, his head tilted to one side,
 as if he were listening to something—
On deck, there was shouting and commotion. Curtis rushed out, pulling
 on his slicker as he went. The shout from the watch forward had been
 picked up, and was being relayed all over the ship. The words struck on
 Curtis' ears with a note of impending tragedy.


 ""Breakers ahead!""


 He was beside Navigating Officer Nelson on the bridge, and saw the
 helmsman climbing the rapidly spinning wheel like a monkey as he put it
 hard aport.


 Then the ship struck. Everything movable shot ahead until it brought up
 at the end of a swing or smacked against something solid.


 Curtis felt Nelson's hand grip his shoulder, as he put his lips close
 to his ear and shouted: ""You must have been right, sir, and the radio
 bearings and my reckoning wrong. We've hit that reef a terrific smack.
 I'm afraid we're gored!""


 ""Get out the collision mat!"" Curtis ordered. ""We ought to be able to
 keep her up!""


 And then he became aware of a deadly stillness. A vast wall of silence
 enveloped the entire cruiser. Looking over the side, he could no longer
 see the waves that a few minutes before had beaten savagely against the
 ship.


 The
Comerford
was shrouded in a huge pall of yellowish-gray mist, and
 more of it was coming up from below—from ventilators and hatchways and
 skylights—as if the whole ship were flooded with some evil vapor.


 Somehow, Curtis' mind flashed to the stories he'd heard of the forts of
 the Maginot Line, and of other forts in Holland and Belgium that had
 fallen before the early Nazi blitzkrieg, when their defenders found
 themselves struck numb and helpless by a gas that had been flooded into
 the inner compartments of their strongholds.


 There were those who said it was the work of sappers who had tunneled
 under the foundations, while others laid the induction of the gas to
 Fifth Column traitors. There were a hundred more or less plausible
 explanations—


 The vapor clouds that enveloped the
Comerford
were becoming thicker.
 All about the deck lay the forms of unconscious seamen, suddenly
 stricken helpless. And then Curtis saw other forms flitting about the
 deck—forms that looked like creatures from another world, but he
 recognized them for what they were—men wearing gas masks.


 Nelson was nowhere in sight. The steersman lay in a limp heap beside
 the swinging wheel. Then a gas-masked figure appeared through the
 shroud of mist and steadied it, so that the cruiser would not be
 completely at the mercy of the wind and the waves.


 Curtis heard the anchor let down, as if by invisible hands, the chain
 screaming and flailing its clanking way through the hawse hole. Then he
 was completely walled in by the yellowish-gray mist. He felt his senses
 swimming.


 Voices droned all around him in mumbling confusion—guttural voices
 that ebbed and flowed in a tide of excited talk. He caught a word of
 English now and then, mixed in with a flood of Teuton phonetics.


 Two words, in particular, registered clearly on his mind. One was
 ""
Carethusia
""; the other was ""convoy."" But gradually his eardrums
 began to throb, as if someone were pounding on them from the inside. He
 couldn't get his breath; a cloud seemed to be mounting within him until
 it swept over his brain—


 He felt something strike the side of his head, and realized that he had
 fallen in a heap on the bridge. And after that, he wasn't conscious of
 anything—
The rain had abated to a foggy drizzle. The wash of the surf swung the
Comerford
in a lazy, rolling motion, as she lay with her bow nosing
 into the sandbar at the entrance of the inlet.


 From her bridge, Navigating Officer Nelson watched the gas-masked
 figures moving about the decks, descending companionways—like goblins
 from an ancient fairy tale or a modern horror story. Nelson looked like
 a goblin himself, with his face covered by a respirator. At his side,
 stood his fellow conspirator Bos'n's Mate Joe Bradford, also wearing a
 gas mask.


 Nelson spoke in a low tone, his lips close to Bradford's ear. ""It
 worked, Joe!""


 ""Yeah!"" Bradford agreed. ""It worked—fine!""


 The limp bodies of the
Comerford's
crew were being carried to the
 lowered accommodation ladder and transferred into waiting lifeboats.


 Nelson swore under his breath. ""Reckon it'll take a couple of hours
 before the ship's rid of that damn gas!""


 Bradford shook his head in disagreement. ""The old geezer claims he's
 got a neutralizing chemical in one of them tanks of his that'll clear
 everything up inside half an hour.""


 ""I'd rather get along without Androka, if we could!"" Nelson muttered.
 ""He's nothing but a crackpot!""


 ""It was a crackpot who invented the gas we used to break up the
 Maginot Line,"" Bradford reminded him. ""It saved a lot of lives for the
Fuehrer
—lives that'd have been lost if the forts had to be taken by
 our storm troopers!""


 Nelson grunted and turned away. A short, thick-set figure in the
 uniform of a German naval commander had ascended the accommodation
 ladder and was mounting to the bridge. He, too, was equipped with a
 respirator.


 He came up to Nelson, saluted, and held out his hand, introducing
 himself as Herr Kommander Brandt. He began to speak in German, but
 Nelson stopped him.


 ""I don't speak any German,"" he explained. ""I was born and educated in
 the United States—of German parents, who had been ruined in the First
 World War. My mother committed suicide when she learned that we were
 penniless. My father—"" He paused and cleared his throat.


 ""
Ja!
Your father?"" the German officer prompted, dropping into
 accented English. ""Your father?""


 ""My father dedicated me to a career of revenge—to wipe out his
 wrongs,"" Nelson continued. ""If America hadn't gone into the First
 World War, he wouldn't have lost his business; my mother would still
 be living. When he joined the Nazi party, the way became clear to use
 me—to educate me in a military prep school, then send me to Annapolis,
 for a career in the United States navy—and no one suspected me. No
 one—""


 ""Sometimes,"" Bradford put in, ""I think Curtis suspected you.""


 ""Maybe Curtis'll find out his suspicions were justified,"" Nelson said
 bitterly. ""But it won't do Curtis any good—a commander who's lost
 his ship."" He turned to Brandt. ""You have plenty of men to work the
Comerford
?""


 Brandt nodded his square head. ""We have a full crew—two hundred
 men—officers, seamen, mechanics, radio men, technical experts, all
 German naval reservists living in the United States, who've been sent
 here secretly, a few at a time, during the past six weeks!""
The three—Brandt, Nelson and Bradford—stood on the bridge and talked,
 while the efficient stretcher-bearers worked industriously to remove
 the limp bodies of the
Comerford's
unconscious crew and row them
 ashore.


 And when that task was completed, lifeboats began to come alongside
 with strange-looking radio equipment, and more gas tanks like those
 Androka had brought aboard the
Comerford
with him, and dynamos and
 batteries that looked like something out of a scientific nightmare.


 And bustling all over the place, barking excited commands in German,
 pushing and pulling and pointing to emphasize his directions, was the
 strange figure of Professor Zukor Androka!


 ""The professor's in his glory!"" Nelson remarked to Kommander Brandt.


 ""Funny thing about him,"" Bradford put in, ""is that his inventions work.
 That zone of silence cut us off completely.""


 Kommander Brandt nodded. ""Goodt! But you got your message giving your
 bearings—the wrong ones?""


 ""Yes,"" Nelson said. ""That came through all right. And won't Curtis have
 a time explaining it!""


 ""Hereafter,"" Brandt said solemnly, ""the zone of silence vill be
 projected from the
Comerford
; and ve have another invention of
 Androka's vich vill be even more useful vhen ve come to cut the
Carethusia
out of her convoy.""


 ""The
Carethusia
?"" Nelson asked, in a puzzled tone.


 Brandt said: ""She's a freighter in a convoy out of St. Johns—twelve
 thousand tons. The orders are to take her; not sink her.""


 ""What's the idea?""


 ""Her cargo,"" Brandt explained. ""It iss more precious than rubies. It
 includes a large shipment of boarts.""


 ""Boarts?"" Nelson repeated. ""What are they?""


 ""Boarts,"" Brandt told him, ""are industrial diamonds—black,
 imperfectly crystallized stones, but far more valuable to us than
 flawless diamonds from Tiffany's on Fift' Avenue. They are needed for
 making machine tools. They come from northern Brazil—and our supply is
 low.""


 ""I should think we could get a shipment of these boarts direct from
 Brazil—through the blockade,"" Nelson said, ""without taking the risk of
 capturing a United States navy cruiser.""


 ""There are other things Germany needs desperately on board the
Carethusia
,"" Brandt explained. ""Vanadium and nickel and hundreds of
 barrels of lard oil for machine-tool lubrication. Our agents have been
 watching the convoys closely for weeks for just such a cargo as the
Carethusia
is taking over.""


 ""Can we trust Androka?"" Nelson asked, with a sudden note of suspicion
 in his voice.


 ""Yes,"" Brandt assured him. ""Of all men—we can trust Androka!""


 ""But he's a Czech,"" Nelson argued.


 ""The
gestapo
takes care of Czechs and Poles and Frenchmen and other
 foreigners whom it chooses as its agents,"" Brandt pointed out. ""Androka
 has a daughter and other relations in Prague. He knows that if anything
 misfires, if there is the slightest suspicion of treachery on his part,
 his daughter and the others will suffer. Androka's loyalty is assured!""


 Nelson turned to watch the forward fighting top of the
Comerford
.
 The masked German seamen were installing some sort of apparatus
 up there—a strange-looking object that looked something like an
 old-fashioned trench mortar, and which connected with cables to the
 room that served as Androka's laboratory and workshop.


 Another crew was installing radio apparatus in the mizzentop turret.


 Descending a companionway to see what was going on below, Nelson found
 that portholes were being opened, and men were spraying chemical around
 to rid the below-decks atmosphere of the lethal gas that had overcome
 the
Comerford's
American crew.


 Returning to the bridge, he found that the tide in the inlet had risen
 considerably, and that the cruiser was riding more easily at her anchor.


 Then, at Brandt's orders, the anchor was hauled in, and lifeboats and a
 motor launch were used as tugs to work the vessel entirely free of the
 sand bar. This was accomplished without difficulty.


 Brandt came over to where Nelson was standing on the bridge and held
 out his hand.


 ""Congratulations, Herr Kommander Nelson!"" he said. ""Ve have stolen one
 of the United States navy's newest and fastest cruisers!"" He made a
 gesture as if raising a beer stein to drink a toast. ""
Prosit!
"" he
 added.


 ""
Prosit!
"" Nelson repeated, and the two grinned at each other.
Stars were twinkling in a patch of black-blue sky, and broken mountains
 of gray cloud were skudding before the east wind. Commander Bob Curtis
 found himself lying in wet sand, on a beach, somewhere, with the
 rain—now a light, driving mist—beating on his face. He was chilled;
 his limbs were stiff and numb. His nose and throat felt parched inside,
 as if a wave of searing heat had scorched them.


 According to his last calculations, the
Comerford
had been cruising
 off the Maine coast. This probably was one of the islets of that
 region, or it might be the mainland.


 It was hard work getting to his feet, and when he did manage to stand,
 he could only plant his heels in the sand and sway to and fro for fully
 a minute, like a child learning to walk.


 All around him in the nearly total darkness, he could make out the dim
 forms of men sprawled on the beach; and of other men moving about,
 exploring. He heard the murmur of voices and saw the glow of lighted
 cigarettes.


 A man with a flashlight was approaching him. Its white glare shone for
 a moment in Curtis' face, and the familiar voice of Ensign Jack Dillon
 spoke: ""Commander Curtis! Are you O. K., sir?""


 ""I think so!"" Curtis' heart warmed at the eager expression in Dillon's
 face; at the heartfelt concern in his friendly brown eyes. The young
 ensign was red-headed, impetuous, thoroughly genuine in his emotions.
 ""How about yourself, Jack?"" Curtis added.


 ""A bit of a headache from the gas, but that's all. Any orders, sir?""


 Curtis thought for a moment. ""Muster the crew, as best you can. We'll
 try to make a roll call. Is there any sign of the ship?""


 There was a solemn note in Dillon's voice. ""No, sir. She's been worked
 off the sandbar and put to sea!""


 The words struck Curtis with the numbing shock of a blow on some nerve
 center. For the first time, he realized fully the tragedy that had
 swept down on him. He had lost his ship—one of the United States
 navy's fastest and newest small light cruisers—under circumstances
 which smelled strongly of treachery and sabotage.


 As he thought back, he realized that he
might
have prevented the
 loss, if he had been more alert, more suspicious. For it was clear to
 him now that the
Comerford
had been deliberately steered to this
 place; that the men who had seized her had been waiting here for that
 very purpose.


 The pieces of the picture fitted together like a jigsaw
 puzzle—Androka's zone of silence; the bearings given by radio;
 Navigating Officer Nelson's queer conduct. They were all part of a
 carefully laid plan!


 All the suspicious circumstances surrounding Nelson came flooding into
 Curtis' mind. He had never liked the man; never trusted him. Nelson
 always acted as if he had some secret, something to hide.


 Curtis recalled that Nelson and Androka had long conversations
 together—conversations which they would end abruptly when anyone else
 came within earshot. And Nelson had always been chummy with the worst
 trouble maker in the crew—Bos'n's Mate Bradford.


 Curtis went around, finding the officers, issuing orders. There were
 still some unconscious men to be revived. In a sheltered cove among
 the rocks, an exploring group had found enough dry driftwood to make a
 fire—


 In another hour, the skies had cleared, and white moonlight flooded
 the scene with a ghostly radiance. The men of the
Comerford
had
 all regained consciousness and were drying out in front of the big
 driftwood bonfires in the cove.


 Curtis ordered a beacon kept burning on a high promontory. Then he got
 the men lined up, according to their respective classifications, for a
 check-up on the missing.


 When this was completed, it was found that the
Comerford's
entire
 complement of two hundred and twenty men were present—except
 Navigating Officer Nelson, and Bos'n's Mate Bradford! And Zukor Androka
 was also missing!


 With the coming of dawn, a little exploration revealed that the
Comerford's
crew was marooned on an islet, about a square mile in
 area; that they had been put ashore without food or extra clothing or
 equipment of any kind, and that no boats had been left for them.


 One searching party reported finding the remains of what had been a
 radio station on a high promontory on the north shore of the islet.
 Another had found the remains of tents and log cabins, recently
 demolished, in a small, timbered hollow—a well-hidden spot invisible
 from the air, unless one were flying very low; a place where two
 hundred or more men could have camped.


 There was a good water supply—a small creek fed by springs—but
 nothing in the way of food. Evidently food was a precious commodity
 which the recent inhabitants of the islet couldn't afford to leave
 behind.


 Curtis was studying the wreckage of the wireless station, wondering
 if this might have been the source of Androka's zone of silence, when
 Ensign Jack Dillon came up to him.


 ""There's a coast-guard cutter heading for the island, sir,"" he
 announced.

GUN FOR HIRE
By
MACK

 REYNOLDS
Joe Prantera
 called
 softly, ""Al."" The pleasurable,
 comfortable,
 warm feeling began
 spreading over him, the
 way it always did.


 The older man stopped and
 squinted, but not suspiciously, even
 now.


 The evening was dark, it was unlikely
 that the other even saw the
 circle of steel that was the mouth of
 the shotgun barrel, now resting on
 the car's window ledge.


 ""Who's it?"" he growled.


 Joe Prantera said softly, ""Big Louis
 sent me, Al.""


 And he pressed the trigger.


 And at that moment, the universe
 caved inward upon Joseph Marie
 Prantera.


 There was nausea and nausea upon
 nausea.


 There was a falling through all
 space and through all time. There was
 doubling and twisting and twitching
 of every muscle and nerve.


 There was pain, horror and tumultuous
 fear.


 And he came out of it as quickly
 and completely as he'd gone in.


 He was in, he thought, a hospital
 and his first reaction was to think,
This here California. Everything different.
Then his second thought was
Something went wrong. Big Louis, he
 ain't going to like this.
He brought his thinking to the
 present. So far as he could remember,
 he hadn't completely pulled the trigger.
 That at least meant that whatever
 the rap was it wouldn't be too
 tough. With luck, the syndicate would
 get him off with a couple of years at
 Quentin.


 A door slid open in the wall in a
 way that Joe had never seen a door
 operate before.
This here California.
The clothes on the newcomer were
 wrong, too. For the first time, Joe
 Prantera began to sense an alienness—a
 something that was awfully
 wrong.


 The other spoke precisely and
 slowly, the way a highly educated man
 speaks a language which he reads
 and writes fluently but has little occasion
 to practice vocally. ""You have recovered?""


 Joe Prantera looked at the other
 expressionlessly. Maybe the old duck
 was one of these foreign doctors, like.


 The newcomer said, ""You have undoubtedly
 been through a most harrowing
 experience. If you have any
 untoward symptoms, possibly I could
 be of assistance.""


 Joe couldn't figure out how he
 stood. For one thing, there should
 have been some kind of police guard.


 The other said, ""Perhaps a bit of
 stimulant?""


 Joe said flatly, ""I wanta lawyer.""


 The newcomer frowned at him. ""A
 lawyer?""


 ""I'm not sayin' nothin'. Not until I
 get a mouthpiece.""


 The newcomer started off on another
 tack. ""My name is Lawrence
 Reston-Farrell. If I am not mistaken,
 you are Joseph Salviati-Prantera.""


 Salviati happened to be Joe's mother's
 maiden name. But it was unlikely
 this character could have known that.
 Joe had been born in Naples and his
 mother had died in childbirth. His
 father hadn't brought him to the
 States until the age of five and by that
 time he had a stepmother.


 ""I wanta mouthpiece,"" Joe said
 flatly, ""or let me outta here.""


 Lawrence Reston-Farrell said, ""You
 are not being constrained. There are
 clothes for you in the closet there.""


 Joe gingerly tried swinging his
 feet to the floor and sitting up, while
 the other stood watching him, strangely.
 He came to his feet. With the exception
 of a faint nausea, which
 brought back memories of that extreme
 condition he'd suffered during
 ... during what? He hadn't the
 vaguest idea of what had happened.


 He was dressed in a hospital-type
 nightgown. He looked down at it and
 snorted and made his way over to the
 closet. It opened on his approach, the
 door sliding back into the wall in
 much the same manner as the room's
 door had opened for Reston-Farrell.


 Joe Prantera scowled and said,
 ""These ain't my clothes.""


 ""No, I am afraid not.""


 ""You think I'd be seen dead wearing
 this stuff? What is this, some religious
 crackpot hospital?""


 Reston-Farrell said, ""I am afraid,
 Mr. Salviati-Prantera, that these are
 the only garments available. I suggest
 you look out the window there.""


 Joe gave him a long, chill look
 and then stepped to the window. He
 couldn't figure the other. Unless he
 was a fruitcake. Maybe he was in
 some kind of pressure cooker and
 this was one of the fruitcakes.


 He looked out, however, not on the
 lawns and walks of a sanitarium but
 upon a wide boulevard of what was
 obviously a populous city.


 And for a moment again, Joe Prantera
 felt the depths of nausea.


 This was not his world.


 He stared for a long, long moment.
 The cars didn't even have wheels, he
 noted dully. He turned slowly and
 faced the older man.


 Reston-Farrell said compassionately,
 ""Try this, it's excellent cognac.""


 Joe Prantera stared at him, said finally,
 flatly, ""What's it all about?""


 The other put down the unaccepted
 glass. ""We were afraid first
 realization would be a shock to you,""
 he said. ""My colleague is in the adjoining
 room. We will be glad to explain
 to you if you will join us there.""


 ""I wanta get out of here,"" Joe said.


 ""Where would you go?""


 The fear of police, of Al Rossi's
 vengeance, of the measures that
 might be taken by Big Louis on his
 failure, were now far away.


 Reston-Farrell had approached the
 door by which he had entered and it
 reopened for him. He went through
 it without looking back.


 There was nothing else to do. Joe
 dressed, then followed him.
In the adjoining room was a circular
 table that would have accommodated
 a dozen persons. Two were
 seated there now, papers, books and
 soiled coffee cups before them. There
 had evidently been a long wait.


 Reston-Farrell, the one Joe had already
 met, was tall and drawn of face
 and with a chainsmoker's nervousness.
 The other was heavier and more
 at ease. They were both, Joe estimated,
 somewhere in their middle fifties.
 They both looked like docs. He
 wondered, all over again, if this was
 some kind of pressure cooker.


 But that didn't explain the view
 from the window.


 Reston-Farrell said, ""May I present
 my colleague, Citizen Warren Brett-James?
 Warren, this is our guest from
 ... from yesteryear, Mr. Joseph Salviati-Prantera.""


 Brett-James nodded to him, friendly,
 so far as Joe could see. He said
 gently, ""I think it would be Mr. Joseph
 Prantera, wouldn't it? The maternal
 linage was almost universally
 ignored."" His voice too gave the impression
 he was speaking a language
 not usually on his tongue.


 Joe took an empty chair, hardly
 bothering to note its alien qualities.
 His body seemed to
fit
into the piece
 of furniture, as though it had been
 molded to his order.


 Joe said, ""I think maybe I'll take
 that there drink, Doc.""


 Reston-Farrell said, ""Of course,""
 and then something else Joe didn't
 get. Whatever the something else
 was, a slot opened in the middle of
 the table and a glass, so clear of texture
 as to be all but invisible, was
 elevated. It contained possibly three
 ounces of golden fluid.


 Joe didn't allow himself to think
 of its means of delivery. He took up
 the drink and bolted it. He put the
 glass down and said carefully,
 ""What's it all about, huh?""


 Warren Brett-James said soothingly,
 ""Prepare yourself for somewhat
 of a shock, Mr. Prantera. You are no
 longer in Los Angeles—""


 ""Ya think I'm stupid? I can see
 that.""


 ""I was about to say, Los Angeles of
 1960. Mr. Prantera, we welcome you
 to Nuevo Los Angeles.""


 ""Ta where?""


 ""To Nuevo Los Angeles and to
 the year—"" Brett-James looked at his
 companion. ""What is the date, Old
 Calendar?""


 ""2133,"" Reston-Farrell said. ""2133
 A.D. they would say.""


 Joe Prantera looked from one of
 them to the other, scowling. ""What
 are you guys talking about?""


 Warren Brett-James said softly,
 ""Mr. Prantera, you are no longer in
 the year 1960, you are now in the
 year 2133.""


 He said, uncomprehendingly, ""You
 mean I been, like, unconscious for—""
 He let the sentence fall away as he
 realized the impossibility.


 Brett-James said gently, ""Hardly
 for one hundred and seventy years,
 Mr. Prantera.""


 Reston-Farrell said, ""I am afraid we
 are confusing you. Briefly, we have
transported
you, I suppose one might
 say, from your own era to ours.""


 Joe Prantera had never been exposed
 to the concept of time travel.
 He had simply never associated with
 anyone who had ever even remotely
 considered such an idea. Now he said,
 ""You mean, like, I been asleep all
 that time?""


 ""Not exactly,"" Brett-James said,
 frowning.


 Reston-Farrell said, ""Suffice to say,
 you are now one hundred and seventy-three
 years after the last memory you
 have.""


 Joe Prantera's mind suddenly reverted
 to those last memories and his
 eyes narrowed dangerously. He felt
 suddenly at bay. He said, ""Maybe
 you guys better let me in on what's
 this all about.""


 Reston-Farrell said, ""Mr. Prantera,
 we have brought you from your era
 to perform a task for us.""


 Joe stared at him, and then at the
 other. He couldn't believe he was getting
 through to them. Or, at least,
 that they were to him.


 Finally he said, ""If I get this, you
 want me to do a job for you.""


 ""That is correct.""


 Joe said, ""You guys know the kind
 of jobs I do?""


 ""That is correct.""


 ""Like hell you do. You think I'm
 stupid? I never even seen you before.""
 Joe Prantera came abruptly to
 his feet. ""I'm gettin' outta here.""


 For the second time, Reston-Farrell
 said, ""Where would you go, Mr.
 Prantera?""


 Joe glared at him. Then sat down
 again, as abruptly as he'd arisen.
""Let's start all over again. I got this
 straight, you brought me, some
 screwy way, all the way ... here.
 O.K., I'll buy that. I seen what it looks
 like out that window—"" The real
 comprehension was seeping through
 to him even as he talked. ""Everybody
 I know, Jessie, Tony, the Kid, Big
 Louis, everybody, they're dead. Even
 Big Louis.""


 ""Yes,"" Brett-James said, his voice
 soft. ""They are all dead, Mr. Prantera.
 Their children are all dead, and their
 grandchildren.""


 The two men of the future said
 nothing more for long minutes while
 Joe Prantera's mind whirled its confusion.


 Finally he said, ""What's this bit
 about you wanting me to give it to
 some guy.""


 ""That is why we brought you here,
 Mr. Prantera. You were ... you
 are, a professional assassin.""


 ""Hey, wait a minute, now.""


 Reston-Farrell went on, ignoring
 the interruption. ""There is small
 point in denying your calling. Pray
 remember that at the point when we
 ...
transported
you, you were about
 to dispose of a contemporary named
 Alphonso Annunziata-Rossi. A citizen,
 I might say, whose demise would
 probably have caused small dismay to
 society.""


 They had him pegged all right. Joe
 said, ""But why me? Why don't you
 get some heavy from now? Somebody
 knows the ropes these days.""


 Brett-James said, ""Mr. Prantera,
 there are no professional assassins in
 this age, nor have there been for over
 a century and a half.""


 ""Well, then do it yourself."" Joe
 Prantera's irritation over this whole
 complicated mess was growing. And
 already he was beginning to long for
 the things he knew—for Jessie and
 Tony and the others, for his favorite
 bar, for the lasagne down at Papa
 Giovanni's. Right now he could have
 welcomed a calling down at the hands
 of Big Louis.


 Reston-Farrell had come to his feet
 and walked to one of the large room's
 windows. He looked out, as though
 unseeing. Then, his back turned, he
 said, ""We have tried, but it is simply
 not in us, Mr. Prantera.""


 ""You mean you're yella?""


 ""No, if by that you mean afraid. It
 is simply not within us to take the
 life of a fellow creature—not to speak
 of a fellow man.""


 Joe snapped: ""Everything you guys
 say sounds crazy. Let's start all over
 again.""


 Brett-James said, ""Let me do it,
 Lawrence."" He turned his eyes to Joe.
 ""Mr. Prantera, in your own era, did
 you ever consider the future?""


 Joe looked at him blankly.


 ""In your day you were confronted
 with national and international, problems.
 Just as we are today and just as
 nations were a century or a millennium
 ago.""


 ""Sure, O.K., so we had problems. I
 know whatcha mean—like wars, and
 depressions and dictators and like
 that.""


 ""Yes, like that,"" Brett-James
 nodded.


 The heavy-set man paused a moment.
 ""Yes, like that,"" he repeated.
 ""That we confront you now indicates
 that the problems of your day were
 solved. Hadn't they been, the world
 most surely would have destroyed itself.
 Wars? Our pedagogues are hard
 put to convince their students that
 such ever existed. More than a century
 and a half ago our society eliminated
 the reasons for international
 conflict. For that matter,"" he added
 musingly, ""we eliminated most international
 boundaries. Depressions?
 Shortly after your own period, man
 awoke to the fact that he had achieved
 to the point where it was possible to
 produce an abundance for all with a
 minimum of toil. Overnight, for all
 practical purposes, the whole world
 was industrialized, automated. The
 second industrial revolution was accompanied
 by revolutionary changes
 in almost every field, certainly in every
 science. Dictators? Your ancestors
 found, Mr. Prantera, that it is
 difficult for a man to be free so long
 as others are still enslaved. Today the
 democratic ethic has reached a pinnacle
 never dreamed of in your own
 era.""


 ""O.K., O.K.,"" Joe Prantera growled.
 ""So everybody's got it made. What I
 wanta know is what's all this about
 me giving it ta somebody? If everything's
 so great, how come you want
 me to knock this guy off?""


 Reston-Farrell bent forward and
 thumped his right index finger twice
 on the table. ""The bacterium of hate—a
 new strain—has found the human
 race unprotected from its disease.
 We had thought our vaccines
 immunized us.""


 ""What's that suppose to mean?""


 Brett-James took up the ball again.
 ""Mr. Prantera, have you ever heard of
 Ghengis Khan, of Tamerlane, Alexander,
 Caesar?""


 Joe Prantera scowled at him emptily.


 ""Or, more likely, of Napoleon, Hitler,
 Stalin?""


 ""Sure I heard of Hitler and Stalin,""
 Joe growled. ""I ain't stupid.""


 The other nodded. ""Such men are
 unique. They have a drive ... a
 drive to power which exceeds by far
 the ambitions of the average man.
 They are genii in their way, Mr. Prantera,
 genii of evil. Such a genius of
 evil has appeared on the current
 scene.""


 ""Now we're getting somewheres,""
 Joe snorted. ""So you got a guy what's
 a little ambitious, like, eh? And you
 guys ain't got the guts to give it to
 him. O.K. What's in it for me?""


 The two of them frowned, exchanged
 glances. Reston-Farrell said,
 ""You know, that is one aspect we had
 not considered.""


 Brett-James said to Joe Prantera,
 ""Had we not, ah, taken you at the
 time we did, do you realize what
 would have happened?""


 ""Sure,"" Joe grunted. ""I woulda let
 old Al Rossi have it right in the guts,
 five times. Then I woulda took the
 plane back to Chi.""


 Brett-James was shaking his head.
 ""No. You see, by coincidence, a police
 squad car was coming down the
 street just at that moment to arrest
 Mr. Rossi. You would have been apprehended.
 As I understand Californian
 law of the period, your life
 would have been forfeit, Mr. Prantera.""


 Joe winced. It didn't occur to him
 to doubt their word.


 Reston-Farrell said, ""As to reward,
 Mr. Prantera, we have already told
 you there is ultra-abundance in this
 age. Once this task has been performed,
 we will sponsor your entry
 into present day society. Competent
 psychiatric therapy will soon remove
 your present—""


 ""Waita minute, now. You figure on
 gettin' me candled by some head
 shrinker, eh? No thanks, Buster. I'm
 going back to my own—""


 Brett-James was shaking his head
 again. ""I am afraid there is no return,
 Mr. Prantera. Time travel works but
 in one direction,
with
the flow of the
 time stream. There can be no return
 to your own era.""


 Joe Prantera had been rocking
 with the mental blows he had been
 assimilating, but this was the final
 haymaker. He was stuck in this
 squaresville of a world.
Joe Prantera on a job was thorough.


 Careful, painstaking, competent.


 He spent the first three days of his
 life in the year 2133 getting the feel
 of things. Brett-James and Reston-Farrell
 had been appointed to work
 with him. Joe didn't meet any of the
 others who belonged to the group
 which had taken the measures to
 bring him from the past. He didn't
 want to meet them. The fewer persons
 involved, the better.


 He stayed in the apartment of
 Reston-Farrell. Joe had been right,
 Reston-Farrell was a medical doctor.
 Brett-James evidently had something
 to do with the process that had enabled
 them to bring Joe from the
 past. Joe didn't know how they'd
 done it, and he didn't care. Joe was a
 realist. He was here. The thing was
 to adapt.


 There didn't seem to be any hurry.
 Once the deal was made, they left it
 up to him to make the decisions.


 They drove him around the town,
 when he wished to check the traffic
 arteries. They flew him about the
 whole vicinity. From the air, Southern
 California looked much the same
 as it had in his own time. Oceans,
 mountains, and to a lesser extent, deserts,
 are fairly permanent even
 against man's corroding efforts.


 It was while he was flying with
 Brett-James on the second day that
 Joe said, ""How about Mexico? Could
 I make the get to Mexico?""


 The physicist looked at him questioningly.
 ""Get?"" he said.


 Joe Prantera said impatiently, ""The
 getaway. After I give it to this Howard
 Temple-Tracy guy, I gotta go on
 the run, don't I?""


 ""I see."" Brett-James cleared his
 throat. ""Mexico is no longer a separate
 nation, Mr. Prantera. All North
 America has been united into one
 unit. Today, there are only eight nations
 in the world.""


 ""Where's the nearest?""


 ""South America.""


 ""That's a helluva long way to go on
 a get.""


 ""We hadn't thought of the matter
 being handled in that manner.""


 Joe eyed him in scorn. ""Oh, you
 didn't, huh? What happens after I
 give it to this guy? I just sit around
 and wait for the cops to put the arm
 on me?""


 Brett-James grimaced in amusement.
 ""Mr. Prantera, this will probably
 be difficult for you to comprehend,
 but there are no police in this
 era.""


 Joe gaped at him. ""No police!
 What happens if you gotta throw
 some guy in stir?""


 ""If I understand your idiom correctly,
 you mean prison. There are
 no prisons in this era, Mr. Prantera.""


 Joe stared. ""No cops, no jails. What
 stops anybody? What stops anybody
 from just going into some bank, like,
 and collecting up all the bread?""


 Brett-James cleared his throat.
 ""Mr. Prantera, there are no banks.""


 ""No banks! You gotta have banks!""


 ""And no money to put in them.
 We found it a rather antiquated
 method of distribution well over a
 century ago.""


 Joe had given up. Now he merely
 stared.


 Brett-James said reasonably, ""We
 found we were devoting as much
 time to financial matters in all their
 endless ramifications—including
 bank robberies—as we were to productive
 efforts. So we turned to more
 efficient methods of distribution.""
On the fourth day, Joe said, ""O.K.,
 let's get down to facts. Summa the
 things you guys say don't stick together
 so good. Now, first place,
 where's this guy Temple-Tracy you
 want knocked off?""


 Reston-Farrell and Brett-James
 were both present. The three of them
 sat in the living room of the latter's
 apartment, sipping a sparkling wine
 which seemed to be the prevailing
 beverage of the day. For Joe's taste
 it was insipid stuff. Happily, rye was
 available to those who wanted it.


 Reston-Farrell said, ""You mean,
 where does he reside? Why, here in
 this city.""


 ""Well, that's handy, eh?"" Joe
 scratched himself thoughtfully. ""You
 got somebody can finger him for me?""


 ""Finger him?""


 ""Look, before I can give it to this
 guy I gotta know some place where
 he'll be at some time. Get it? Like Al
 Rossi. My finger, he works in Rossi's
 house, see? He lets me know every
 Wednesday night, eight o'clock, Al
 leaves the house all by hisself. O.K.,
 so I can make plans, like, to give it
 to him."" Joe Prantera wound it up
 reasonably. ""You gotta have a finger.""


 Brett-James said, ""Why not just go
 to Temple-Tracy's apartment and, ah,
 dispose of him?""


 ""Jest walk in, eh? You think I'm
 stupid? How do I know how many
 witnesses hangin' around? How do I
 know if the guy's carryin' heat?""


 ""Heat?""


 ""A gun, a gun. Ya think I'm stupid?
 I come to give it to him and he
 gives it to me instead.""


 Dr. Reston-Farrell said, ""Howard
 Temple-Tracy lives alone. He customarily
 receives visitors every afternoon,
 largely potential followers. He
 is attempting to recruit members to
 an organization he is forming. It
 would be quite simple for you to
 enter his establishment and dispose
 of him. I assure you, he does not possess
 weapons.""


 Joe was indignant. ""Just like that,
 eh?"" he said sarcastically. ""Then what
 happens? How do I get out of the
 building? Where's my get car parked?
 Where do I hide out? Where do I
 dump the heat?""


 ""Dump the heat?""


 ""Get rid of the gun. You want I
 should get caught with the gun on
 me? I'd wind up in the gas chamber
 so quick—""


 ""See here, Mr. Prantera,"" Brett-James
 said softly. ""We no longer have
 capital punishment, you must realize.""


 ""O.K. I still don't wanta get caught.
 What
is
the rap these days, huh?""
 Joe scowled. ""You said they didn't
 have no jails any more.""


 ""This is difficult for you to understand,
 I imagine,"" Reston-Farrell told
 him, ""but, you see, we no longer punish
 people in this era.""


 That took a long, unbelieving moment
 to sink in. ""You mean, like, no
 matter what they do? That's crazy.
 Everybody'd be running around giving
 it to everybody else.""


 ""The motivation for crime has
 been removed, Mr. Prantera,"" Reston-Farrell
 attempted to explain. ""A
 person who commits a violence
 against another is obviously in need
 of medical care. And, consequently,
 receives it.""


 ""You mean, like, if I steal a car or
 something, they just take me to a
 doctor?"" Joe Prantera was unbelieving.


 ""Why would anybody wish to steal
 a car?"" Reston-Farrell said easily.


 ""But if I
give it
to somebody?""


 ""You will be turned over to a medical
 institution. Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy
 is the last man you will
 ever kill, Mr. Prantera.""


 A chillness was in the belly of Joe
 Prantera. He said very slowly, very
 dangerously, ""You guys figure on me
 getting caught, don't you?""


 ""Yes,"" Brett-James said evenly.


 ""Well then, figure something else.
 You think I'm stupid?""


 ""Mr. Prantera,"" Dr. Reston-Farrell
 said, ""there has been as much progress
 in the field of psychiatry in the
 past two centuries as there has in
 any other. Your treatment would be
 brief and painless, believe me.""


 Joe said coldly, ""And what happens
 to you guys? How do you know I
 won't rat on you?""


 Brett-James said gently, ""The moment
 after you have accomplished
 your mission, we plan to turn ourselves
 over to the nearest institution
 to have determined whether or not
 we also need therapy.""


 ""Now I'm beginning to wonder
 about you guys,"" Joe said. ""Look, all
 over again, what'd'ya wanta give it to
 this guy for?""


 The doctor said, ""We explained
 the other day, Mr. Prantera. Citizen
 Howard Temple-Tracy is a dangerous,
 atavistic, evil genius. We are
 afraid for our institutions if his plans
 are allowed to mature.""


 ""Well if you got things so good,
 everybody's got it made, like, who'd
 listen to him?""


 The doctor nodded at the validity
 of the question. ""Mr. Prantera,
Homo
 sapiens
is a unique animal. Physically
 he matures at approximately the age
 of thirteen. However, mental maturity
 and adjustment is often not fully
 realized until thirty or even more.
 Indeed, it is sometimes never
 achieved. Before such maturity is
 reached, our youth are susceptible to
 romantic appeal. Nationalism, chauvinism,
 racism, the supposed glory of
 the military, all seem romantic to the
 immature. They rebel at the orderliness
 of present society. They seek entertainment
 in excitement. Citizen
 Temple-Tracy is aware of this and
 finds his recruits among the young.""


 ""O.K., so this guy is dangerous.
 You want him knocked off before he
 screws everything up. But the way
 things are, there's no way of making
 a get. So you'll have to get some other
 patsy. Not me.""


 ""I am afraid you have no alternative,""
 Brett-James said gently. ""Without
 us, what will you do? Mr. Prantera,
 you do not even speak the language.""


 ""What'd'ya mean? I don't understand
 summa the big words you eggheads
 use, but I get by O.K.""


 Brett-James said, ""Amer-English is
 no longer the language spoken by the
 man in the street, Mr. Prantera. Only
 students of such subjects any longer
 speak such tongues as Amer-English,
 French, Russian or the many others
 that once confused the race with
 their limitations as a means of communication.""


 ""You mean there's no place in the
 whole world where they talk American?""
 Joe demanded, aghast.
Dr. Reston-Farrell controlled the
 car. Joe Prantera sat in the seat next
 to him and Warren Brett-James sat
 in the back. Joe had, tucked in his
 belt, a .45 caliber automatic, once displayed
 in a museum. It had been
 more easily procured than the ammunition
 to fit it, but that problem too
 had been solved.


 The others were nervous, obviously
 repelled by the very conception of
 what they had planned.


 Inwardly, Joe was amused. Now
 that they had got in the clutch, the
 others were on the verge of chickening
 out. He knew it wouldn't have
 taken much for them to cancel the
 project. It wasn't any answer though.
 If they allowed him to call it off today,
 they'd talk themselves into it
 again before the week was through.


 Besides, already Joe was beginning
 to feel the comfortable, pleasurable,
 warm feeling that came to him on
 occasions like this.


 He said, ""You're sure this guy talks
 American, eh?""


 Warren Brett-James said, ""Quite
 sure. He is a student of history.""


 ""And he won't think it's funny I
 talk American to him, eh?""


 ""He'll undoubtedly be intrigued.""


 They pulled up before a large
 apartment building that overlooked
 the area once known as Wilmington.


 Joe was coolly efficient now. He
 pulled out the automatic, held it
 down below his knees and threw a
 shell into the barrel. He eased the
 hammer down, thumbed on the
 safety, stuck the weapon back in his
 belt and beneath the jacketlike garment
 he wore.


 He said, ""O.K. See you guys later.""
 He left them and entered the building.


 An elevator—he still wasn't used
 to their speed in this era—whooshed
 him to the penthouse duplex occupied
 by Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy.


 There were two persons in the reception
 room but they left on Joe's
 arrival, without bothering to look at
 him more than glancingly.


 He spotted the screen immediately
 and went over and stood before it.


 The screen lit and revealed a
 heavy-set, dour of countenance man
 seated at a desk. He looked into Joe
 Prantera's face, scowled and said
 something.


 Joe said, ""Joseph Salviati-Prantera
 to interview Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy.""


 The other's shaggy eyebrows rose.
 ""Indeed,"" he said. ""In Amer-English?""


 Joe nodded.


 ""Enter,"" the other said.


 A door had slid open on the other
 side of the room. Joe walked through
 it and into what was obviously an office.
 Citizen Temple-Tracy sat at a
 desk. There was only one other chair
 in the room. Joe Prantera ignored it
 and remained standing.


 Citizen Temple-Tracy said, ""What
 can I do for you?""


 Joe looked at him for a long, long
 moment. Then he reached down to
 his belt and brought forth the .45
 automatic. He moistened his lips.


 Joe said softly, ""You know what
 this here is?""


 Temple-Tracy stared at the weapon.
 ""It's a handgun, circa, I would
 say, about 1925 Old Calendar. What
 in the world are you doing with it?""


 Joe said, very slowly, ""Chief, in the
 line you're in these days you needa
 heavy around with wunna these. Otherwise,
 Chief, you're gunna wind up
 in some gutter with a lotta holes in
 you. What I'm doin', I'm askin' for a
 job. You need a good man knows how
 to handle wunna these, Chief.""


 Citizen Howard Temple-Tracy
 eyed him appraisingly. ""Perhaps,"" he
 said, ""you are right at that. In the near
 future, I may well need an assistant
 knowledgeable in the field of violence.
 Tell me more about yourself.
 You surprise me considerably.""


 ""Sure, Chief. It's kinda a long
 story, though. First off, I better tell
 you you got some bad enemies, Chief.
 Two guys special, named Brett-James
 and Doc Reston-Farrell. I think one
 of the first jobs I'm gunna hafta do
 for you, Chief, is to give it to those
 two.""

         A friend of mine offers a theory about why Bill Clinton's poll numbers stayed so high throughout the Lewinsky scandal: The news made it possible for serious-minded people to spend lots of time--at the office and over lunch--talking about semen stains, vaginal insertions, and blow jobs. And the people were grateful. 

         That's probably because they're not getting all that much themselves. A recent University of Chicago survey of 10,000 adults found that Americans are having considerably less sex than was generally thought. Only one American in 20 has sex three times a week. One in five didn't score at all last year. 

         If that's true, many of us could use a little sexual self-improvement. Not me, of course. I have been happily married for 26 years, since the age of 21. Deb and I have what seems to us to be a perfectly fine amorous life, yet everywhere I turn the culture tells me--almost mocks me-- you can do better! What would happen to our sex life then, if Deb (who participated in this story because she loves me and because she has tenure) and I tried for the first time to make something happen to it? 

         And so it was that we found ourselves for the first time ever in a sex-toy store, A Touch of Romance, located near our home in Los Angeles, across the street from a Macy's. The idea behind shops like these is to make obtaining the materials of sexual experimentation as ordinary as purchasing plumbing supplies or housewares. 

         Which sort of works--the only sexual thrill I got from the visit was knowing that Microsoft just bought a cock ring. Choosing it wasn't easy. Most of them came in presized sets of three. I couldn't figure out which would fit right and intuited that try-ons weren't an option. So I opted instead for an adjustable circumference version, a little strip of vinyl with snaps for $11.95. Man, what a rip-off! Unless it works. 

         It doesn't. Back home, I derived a certain depraved buzz in cinching the device on, but that was soon eclipsed. The thing works on the Roach Motel principle--your blood gets in but it can't get out. But then I got to thinking: Under battlefield conditions it doesn't get out anyway. And while I should have been paying more attention to other things, this led to thinking about the old joke with the punch line ""... and right ball go POW."" My wife hadn't noticed any difference at all.

         A woman I know says women's magazines are the best places in America to find sex tips. She's right--go ahead, just try to find a sewing pattern in Redbook . You're much more likely to land on ""Try phone sex, dirty notes, porn videos, fantasy games and sex in new places. ... Try lingerie and no underwear. ... Try talking dirty and silk scarves. Try anything at all,"" or articles such as ""Eight New Games for the Foreplay Challenged."" 

         An article in the April Cosmopolitan , ""The Six Best Sex Positions,"" seemed more promising than the Redbook playbook. Each position was accompanied by a succinct write-up and a stick-figure diagram. The position we settled on was ""The Butterfly,"" which we had to read three times to comprehend. The man stands, the woman remains supine on a bed or counter-top with her feet up on his shoulders. The whole idea is to produce a pelvic tilt for better access to the G spot. Instead, we experienced an uncomfortable pretzel feeling that stick figures must be immune to. And in general, Cosmopolitan 's exotic sex positions require the sort of body placement you can't remember in the moment of passion and even if you could, for proper alignment, you still might need mood-killing accessories such as a plumb line and a laser pen.

         Next we tried those ""Better Sex"" instructional videos advertised in the New York Times                 Book Review. I ordered Better Sexual Techniques , Advanced Sexual Techniques , Making Sex Fun , and Advanced Oral Sex Techniques (priced about $11.95 each, not including shipping and handling). My wife couldn't bear to watch them; I persevered but must admit it was a chore. The oral-sex tape starts with ""well-known sex therapist"" Diana Wiley, in her poofy hair and broad-shouldered blue power suit, looking like she was about to explain how the sales force could increase its third-quarter productivity. Instead she runs through all the euphemisms for oral sex and then the video cuts to XXX action with gratuitous commentary. 

         Wiley's overexplanation of everything two people can do to each other with their mouths raises this question: Do you really need a five-minute video segment on whether or not to swallow? In the great tradition of hotel and travel ads, the guys tend to be markedly less attractive than the women. No way he'd be with her if this wasn't an instructional sex video! The inanity of the experts and the dubious casting make these films about as erotic as ... well, as the New York Times . You could learn more from any randomly selected porn video.

         Another approach is food. The notion that certain foods, such as oysters or rhino horn, are aphrodisiacs has been pretty much discounted. But it's plausible to think that cooking a meal together and then dining on it, just the two of you, could be erotic. Especially if (like me) your schedule frequently forces you to eat alone and you often find yourself standing in front of the microwave, screaming, ""Come on, goddammit!"" Intercourses , by Martha Hopkins and Randall Lockridge ($24.95, Terrace Publishing, 1997), preaches that for every time of day and every phase of a relationship there is a type of eating experience that will heighten sexual response. (There's also a chart showing which foods are good for eating off which body parts.) Deb and I blocked off a whole Saturday afternoon and evening for the Intercourses experiment, settling on rosemary-scented lamb over pasta (Page 87) followed by frozen coffee almond dessert (Page 31). According to the book, rosemary is sexy because of its fragrance (used in many perfumes) and because of its texture, which, so the text assured, tickles nerve endings. The dessert was mostly coffee, rum, and Kahlua, which has worked before. 

         We shopped for the food together and cooked together, drinking wine and beer along the way. At one point while I was working on the dessert, I asked my wife how long to beat the heavy cream mixture. ""Till it's stiff--it's an aphrodisiac,"" she said. Preparation took less than an hour, and everything came out perfectly. Eating at our dining room table for the first time ever without guests, we were having fun by candlelight. But the mood was romantic, not erotic.

         That's when we went for the Viagra ($212.50 for 10 doses, which includes a ""consultation"" fee). The drug was prescribed by a doctor, whom I've never met, and ordered from a pharmacy in Miami Beach, Fla., where I've never been. I completed the transaction via the Internet after filling out a cover-their-ass questionnaire in three minutes. 

         We each decided to take one pill, clinked our glasses, and gulped. And then what? It felt awkward sitting in our bedroom, knowing that it could take up to an hour for Viagra to ""work."" I suggested that we play strip poker, something I'd never done. Deb had never even played poker, so I had to explain the rules. I won in about six hands, auspiciously I thought, with three aces. But we still weren't really in the mood yet. 

         So then I got out the other purchase I'd made at A Touch of Romance--""Dirty Dice"" ($4.95). One of the two pink cubes is marked with these words instead of dots: ""lips,"" ""above waist,"" ""ear,"" ""breast,"" ""below waist,"" and ""?"". The other cube is labeled ""kiss,"" ""squeeze,"" ""lick,"" ""blow,"" ""suck,"" and ""eat."" We took turns throwing the dice, but the activities generated seemed forced and arbitrary. Finally, as they say at NASA, there was word from the pad that the launch sequence was initiating. It was pretty much like all other sex, except for a slight lightheadedness. Deb said she noticed a remote tingling sensation. On the plus side, there was no priapism and neither of us experienced disruption of our color vision nor a fatal heart attack, which was nice. 

                         Overall rating: 5 toes curled.              

         St. Augustine held lust to be a fitting punishment for man's disobedience to God: the body's disobeying of the mind, the will, the spirit, and even of itself. (The paradigm of this for him is the unbidden hard-on.) Jean-Paul Sartre discovered something similar, although celebrating it rather than deploring it: Essential to the erotic is the body's defiance of design and control. (The paradigm of this for him is the jiggle.) Sartre's view yields a sort of sexual Heisenberg principle: There is an inherent tension between physically abandoning yourself to another on the one hand and sexual planning on the other. The more of the one, the less of the other. And this, I discovered, is the chief obstacle to sexual self-help. Getting an erection is sexy. Making one is not. As my wife said about Viagra, ""You start to have a new feeling and then you realize where it came from and then you don't have it so much. ... Anything that makes you think about it like that is just creepy."" 

         This is not to say there isn't a way out of this conflict between desire and design. With homage to our potent POTUS, there is, I think, a Third Way that's neither sexual complacency nor standard self-help. If the intrusion of consciousness is the problem, then maybe the answer is to block it out. Sure, you could do this the old-fashioned way: with alcohol and drugs. But then you have all the traditional drawbacks, including diminished physical attractiveness and degraded sexual performance. 

         So how about this instead? Go for all the sexual self-help you can, but do it covertly . Watch a sex video (or porn flick) if you want--but by yourself, and then try to share what you learned without sharing how you learned it. Don't tell your partner you took Viagra. Or give each other standing permission to slip it into the odd after-dinner drink, saying nothing. (Of course, when you do it you'll still know, but having an unselfconsciously turned-on partner is a real compensation for that, and next time, your partner can surprise you. And yes, this requires trust. But why would you be having sex with someone you don't trust?) My main conclusion is that contrary to our blabby culture, the key to a better sex life is less communication.

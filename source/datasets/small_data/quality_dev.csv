Behind a pale Venusian mask lay hidden the
 
arch-humanist, the anti-tech killer ... one of
 
those who needlessly had strewn Malone blood
 
across the heavens from Saturn to the sun.
 
Now—on distant Trojan asteroids—the
 
rendezvous for death was plainly marked.

The most dangerous is not the outlawed murderer, who only slays men,
 but the rebellious philosopher: for he destroys worlds.


 Darkness and the chill glitter of stars. Bo Jonsson crouched on a
 whirling speck of stone and waited for the man who was coming to kill
 him.


 There was no horizon. The flying mountain on which he stood was
 too small. At his back rose a cliff of jagged rock, losing its own
 blackness in the loom of shadows; its teeth ate raggedly across the
 Milky Way. Before him, a tumbled igneous wilderness slanted crazily
 off, with one long thin crag sticking into the sky like a grotesque
 bowsprit.


 There was no sound except the thudding of his own heart, the harsh rasp
 of his own breath, locked inside the stinking metal skin of his suit.
 Otherwise ... no air, no heat, no water or life or work of man, only a
 granite nakedness spinning through space out beyond Mars.


 Stooping, awkward in the clumsy armor, he put the transparent plastic
 of his helmet to the ground. Its cold bit at him even through the
 insulating material. He might be able to hear the footsteps of his
 murderer conducted through the ground.


 Stillness answered him. He gulped a heavy lungful of tainted air
 and rose. The other might be miles away yet, or perhaps very close,
 catfooting too softly to set up vibrations. A man could do that when
 gravity was feeble enough.


 The stars blazed with a cruel wintry brilliance, over him, around
 him, light-years to fall through emptiness before he reached one. He
 had been alone among them before; he had almost thought them friends.
 Sometimes, on a long watch, a man found himself talking to Vega or
 Spica or dear old Beetle Juice, murmuring what was in him as if the
 remote sun could understand. But they didn't care, he saw that now. To
 them, he did not exist, and they would shine carelessly long after he
 was gone into night.


 He had never felt so alone as now, when another man was on the asteroid
 with him, hunting him down.


 Bo Jonsson looked at the wrench in his hand. It was long and massive,
 it would have been heavy on Earth, but it was hardly enough to unscrew
 the stars and reset the machinery of a universe gone awry. He smiled
 stiffly at the thought. He wanted to laugh too, but checked himself for
 fear he wouldn't be able to stop.
Let's face it
, he told himself.
You're scared. You're scared
 sweatless.
He wondered if he had spoken it aloud.


 There was plenty of room on the asteroid. At least two hundred square
 miles, probably more if you allowed for the rough surface. He could
 skulk around, hide ... and suffocate when his tanked air gave out. He
 had to be a hunter, too, and track down the other man, before he died.
 And if he found his enemy, he would probably die anyway.


 He looked about him. Nothing. No sound, no movement, nothing but the
 streaming of the constellations as the asteroid spun. Nothing had ever
 moved here, since the beginning of time when moltenness congealed into
 death. Not till men came and hunted each other.


 Slowly he forced himself to move. The thrust of his foot sent him
 up, looping over the cliff to drift down like a dead leaf in Earth's
 October. Suit, equipment, and his own body, all together, weighed only
 a couple of pounds here. It was ghostly, this soundless progress over
 fields which had never known life. It was like being dead already.


 Bo Jonsson's tongue was dry and thick in his mouth. He wanted to
 find his enemy and give up, buy existence at whatever price it would
 command. But he couldn't do that. Even if the other man let him do it,
 which was doubtful, he couldn't. Johnny Malone was dead.


 Maybe that was what had started it all—the death of Johnny Malone.
There are numerous reasons for basing on the Trojan asteroids, but
 the main one can be given in a single word: stability. They stay put
 in Jupiter's orbit, about sixty degrees ahead and behind, with only
 minor oscillations; spaceships need not waste fuel coming up to a body
 which has been perturbed a goodly distance from where it was supposed
 to be. The trailing group is the jumping-off place for trans-Jovian
 planets, the leading group for the inner worlds—that way, their own
 revolution about the sun gives the departing ship a welcome boost,
 while minimizing the effects of Jupiter's drag.


 Moreover, being dense clusters, they have attracted swarms of miners,
 so that Achilles among the leaders and Patroclus in the trailers have a
 permanent boom town atmosphere. Even though a spaceship and equipment
 represent a large investment, this is one of the last strongholds of
 genuinely private enterprise: the prospector, the mine owner, the
 rockhound dreaming of the day when his stake is big enough for him to
 start out on his own—a race of individualists, rough and noisy and
 jealous, but living under iron rules of hospitality and rescue.


 The Last Chance on Achilles has another name, which simply sticks an
 ""r"" in the official one; even for that planetoid, it is a rowdy bar
 where Guardsmen come in trios. But Johnny Malone liked it, and talked
 Bo Jonsson into going there for a final spree before checkoff and
 departure. ""Nothing to compare,"" he insisted. ""Every place else is
 getting too fantangling civilized, except Venus, and I don't enjoy
 Venus.""


 Johnny was from Luna City himself: a small, dark man with the quick
 nervous movements and dipped accent of that roaring commercial
 metropolis. He affected the latest styles, brilliant colors in the
 flowing tunic and slacks, a beret cocked on his sleek head. But somehow
 he didn't grate on Bo, they had been partners for several years now.


 They pushed through a milling crowd at the bar, rockhounds who watched
 one of Achilles' three live ecdysiasts with hungry eyes, and by some
 miracle found an empty booth. Bo squeezed his bulk into one side of the
 cubicle while Johnny, squinting through a reeking smoke-haze, dialed
 drinks. Bo was larger and heavier than most spacemen—he'd never have
 gotten his certificate before the ion drive came in—and was usually
 content to let others talk while he listened. A placid blond giant,
 with amiable blue eyes in a battered brown face, he did not consider
 himself bright, and always wanted to learn.


 Johnny gulped his drink and winced. ""Whiskey, they call it yet! Water,
 synthetic alcohol, and a dash of caramel they have the gall to label
 whiskey and charge for!""


 ""Everything's expensive here,"" said Bo mildly. ""That's why so few
 rockhounds get rich. They make a lot of money, but they have to spend
 it just as fast to stay alive.""


 ""Yeh ... yeh ... wish they'd spend some of it on us."" Johnny grinned
 and fed the dispenser another coin. It muttered to itself and slid
 forth a tray with a glass. ""C'mon, drink up, man. It's a long way home,
 and we've got to fortify ourselves for the trip. A bottle, a battle,
 and a wench is what I need. Most especially the wench, because I don't
 think the eminent Dr. McKittrick is gonna be interested in sociability,
 and it's close quarters aboard the
Dog
.""


 Bo kept on sipping slowly. ""Johnny,"" he said, raising his voice to cut
 through the din, ""you're an educated man. I never could figure out why
 you want to talk like a jumper.""


 ""Because I am one at heart. Look, Bo, why don't you get over that
 inferiority complex of yours? A man can't run a spaceship without
 knowing more math and physical science than the average professor on
 Earth. So you had to work your way through the Academy and never had a
 chance to fan yourself with a lily white hand while somebody tootled
 Mozart through a horn. So what?"" Johnny's head darted around, birdlike.
 ""If we want some women we'd better make our reservations now.""


 ""I don't, Johnny,"" said Bo. ""I'll just nurse a beer."" It wasn't morals
 so much as fastidiousness; he'd wait till they hit Luna.


 ""Suit yourself. If you don't want to uphold the honor of the Sirius
 Transportation Company—""


 Bo chuckled. The Company consisted of (a) the
Sirius
; (b) her crew,
 himself and Johnny; (c) a warehouse, berth, and three other part owners
 back in Luna City. Not exactly a tramp ship, because you can't normally
 stop in the middle of an interplanetary voyage and head for somewhere
 else; but she went wherever there was cargo or people to be moved.
 Her margin of profit was not great in spite of the charges, for a
 space trip is expensive; but in a few more years they'd be able to buy
 another ship or two, and eventually Fireball and Triplanetary would be
 getting some competition. Even the public lines might have to worry a
 little.


 Johnny put away another couple of shots and rose. Alcohol cost plenty,
 but it was also more effective in low-gee. ""'Scuse me,"" he said. ""I see
 a target. Sure you don't want me to ask if she has a friend?""


 Bo shook his head and watched his partner move off, swift in the puny
 gravity—the Last Chance didn't centrifuge like some of the tommicker
 places downtown. It was hard to push through the crowd without weight
 to help, but Johnny faded along and edged up to the girl with his
 highest-powered smile. There were several other men standing around
 her, but Johnny had The Touch. He'd be bringing her back here in a few
 minutes.


 Bo sighed, feeling a bit lonesome. If he wasn't going to make a night
 of it, there was no point in drinking heavily. He had to make the final
 inspection of the ship tomorrow, and grudged the cost of anti-hangover
 tablets. Besides what he was putting back into the business, he was
 trying to build a private hoard; some day, he'd retire and get married
 and build a house. He already had the site picked out, on Kullen
 overlooking the Sound, back on Earth. Man, but it was a long time since
 he'd been on Earth!


 A sharp noise slashed through the haze of talk and music Bo looked up.
 There was a tall black haired man, Venusian to judge by his kilts,
 arguing with Johnny. His face was ugly with anger.


 Johnny made some reply. Bo heaved up his form and strode toward the
 discussion, casually picking up anyone in the way and setting him
 aside. Johnny liked a fight, but this Venusian was big.


 As he neared, he caught words: ""—my girl, dammit.""


 ""Like hell I am!"" said the girl. ""I never saw you before—""


 ""Run along and play, son,"" said Johnny. ""Or do you want me to change
 that diaper of yours?""


 That was when it happened. Bo saw the little needler spit from the
 Venusian's fingers. Johnny stood there a moment, looking foolishly at
 the dart in his stomach. Then his knees buckled and he fell with a
 nightmare slowness.


 The Venusian was already on the move. He sprang straight up, slammed a
 kick at the wall, and arced out the door into the dome corridor beyond.
A spaceman, that. Knows how to handle himself in low-gee.
It was the
 only clear thought which ran in the sudden storm of Bo's head.


 The girl screamed. A man cursed and tried to follow the Venusian.
 He tangled with another. ""Get outta my way!"" A roar lifted, someone
 slugged, someone else coolly smashed a bottle against the bar and
 lifted the jagged end. There was the noise of a fist meeting flesh.


 Bo had seen death before. That needle wasn't anesthetic, it was poison.
 He knelt in the riot with Johnny's body in his arms.
II


 Suddenly the world came to an end. There was a sheer drop-off onto the
 next face of the rough cube which was the asteroid. Bo lay on his belly
 and peered down the cliff, it ran for a couple of miles and beyond it
 were the deeps of space and the cold stars. He could dimly see the
 tortured swirl of crystallization patterns in the smooth bareness. No
 place to hide; his enemy was not there.


 He turned the thought over in a mind which seemed stiff and slow. By
 crossing that little plain he was exposing himself to a shot from one
 of its edges. On the other hand, he could just as well be bushwhacked
 from a ravine as he jumped over. And this route was the fastest for
 completing his search scheme.


 The Great Bear slid into sight, down under the world as it turned. He
 had often stood on winter nights, back in Sweden, and seen its immense
 sprawl across the weird flicker of aurora; but even then he wanted the
 spaceman's experience of seeing it from above. Well, now he had his
 wish, and much good it had done him.


 He went over the edge of the cliff, cautiously, for it wouldn't take
 much of an impetus to throw him off this rock entirely. Then his
 helpless and soon frozen body would be just another meteor for the next
 million years. The vague downward sensation of gravity shifted insanely
 as he moved; he had the feeling that the world was tilting around him.
 Now it was the precipice which was a scarred black plain underfoot,
 reaching to a saw-toothed bluff at its farther edge.


 He moved with flat low-gee bounds. Besides the danger of springing off
 the asteroid entirely, there was its low acceleration to keep a man
 near the ground; jump up a few feet and it would take you a while to
 fall back. It was utterly silent around him. He had never thought there
 could be so much stillness.


 He was halfway across when the bullet came. He saw no flash, heard
 no crack, but suddenly the fissured land before him exploded in a
 soundless shower of chips. The bullet ricocheted flatly, heading off
 for outer space. No meteor gravel, that!


 Bo stood unmoving an instant, fighting the impulse to leap away. He was
 a spaceman, not a rockhound; he wasn't used to this environment, and if
 he jumped high he could be riddled as he fell slowly down again. Sweat
 was cold on his body. He squinted, trying to see where the shot had
 come from.


 Suddenly he was zigzagging off across the plain toward the nearest
 edge. Another bullet pocked the ground near him. The sun rose, a tiny
 heatless dazzle blinding in his eyes.


 Fire crashed at his back. Thunder and darkness exploded before him. He
 lurched forward, driven by the impact. Something was roaring, echoes
 clamorous in his helmet. He grew dimly aware that it was himself. Then
 he was falling, whirling down into the black between the stars.


 There was a knife in his back, it was white-hot and twisting between
 the ribs. He stumbled over the edge of the plain and fell, waking when
 his armor bounced a little against stone.


 Breath rattled in his throat as he turned his head. There was a white
 plume standing over his shoulder, air streaming out through the hole
 and freezing its moisture. The knife in him was not hot, it was cold
 with an ultimate cold.


 Around him, world and stars rippled as if seen through heat, through
 fever. He hung on the edge of creation by his fingertips, while chaos
 shouted beneath.
Theoretically, one man can run a spaceship, but in practice two
 or three are required for non-military craft. This is not only an
 emergency reserve, but a preventive of emergencies, for one man alone
 might get too tired at the critical moments. Bo knew he wouldn't be
 allowed to leave Achilles without a certified partner, and unemployed
 spacemen available for immediate hiring are found once in a Venusian
 snowfall.


 Bo didn't care the first day. He had taken Johnny out to Helmet Hill
 and laid him in the barren ground to wait, unchanging now, till
 Judgement Day. He felt empty then, drained of grief and hope alike,
 his main thought a dull dread of having to tell Johnny's father when
 he reached Luna. He was too slow and clumsy with words; his comforting
 hand would only break the old man's back. Old Malone had given six sons
 to space, Johnny was the last; from Saturn to the sun, his blood was
 strewn for nothing.


 It hardly seemed to matter that the Guards office reported itself
 unable to find the murderer. A single Venusian should have been easy to
 trace on Achilles, but he seemed to have vanished completely.


 Bo returned to the transient quarters and dialed Valeria McKittrick.
 She looked impatiently at him out of the screen. ""Well,"" she said,
 ""what's the matter? I thought we were blasting today.""


 ""Hadn't you heard?"" asked Bo. He found it hard to believe she could
 be ignorant, here where everybody's life was known to everybody else.
 ""Johnny's dead. We can't leave.""


 ""Oh ... I'm sorry. He was such a nice little man—I've been in the lab
 all the time, packing my things, and didn't know."" A frown crossed her
 clear brow. ""But you've got to get me back. I've engaged passage to
 Luna with you.""


 ""Your ticket will be refunded, of course,"" said Bo heavily. ""But you
 aren't certified, and the
Sirius
is licensed for no less than two
 operators.""


 ""Well ... damn! There won't be another berth for weeks, and I've
got
to get home. Can't you find somebody?""


 Bo shrugged, not caring much. ""I'll circulate an ad if you want, but—""


 ""Do so, please. Let me know."" She switched off.


 Bo sat for a moment thinking about her. Valeria McKittrick was worth
 considering. She wasn't beautiful in any conventional sense but she was
 tall and well built; there were good lines in the strong high boned
 face, and her hair was a cataract of spectacular red. And brains,
 too ... you didn't get to be a physicist with the Union's radiation
 labs for nothing. He knew she was still young, and that she had been on
 Achilles for about a year working on some special project and was now
 ready to go home.


 She was human enough, had been to most of the officers' parties and
 danced and laughed and flirted mildly, but even the dullest rockhound
 gossip knew she was too lost in her work to do more. Out here a woman
 was rare, and a virtuous woman unheard-of; as a result, unknown to
 herself, Dr. McKittrick's fame had spread through more thousands of
 people and millions of miles than her professional achievements were
 ever likely to reach.


 Since coming here, on commission from the Lunar lab, to bring her
 home, Bo Jonsson had given her an occasional wistful thought. He liked
 intelligent women, and he was getting tired of rootlessness. But of
 course it would be a catastrophe if he fell in love with her because
 she wouldn't look twice at a big dumb slob like him. He had sweated out
 a couple of similar affairs in the past and didn't want to go through
 another.


 He placed his ad on the radinews circuit and then went out to get
 drunk. It was all he could do for Johnny now, drink him a final
 wassail. Already his friend was cold under the stars. In the course of
 the evening he found himself weeping.


 He woke up many hours later. Achilles ran on Earth time but did not
 rotate on it; officially, it was late at night, actually the shrunken
 sun was high over the domes. The man in the upper bunk said there was a
 message for him; he was to call one Einar Lundgard at the Comet Hotel
 soonest.


 The Comet! Anyone who could afford a room to himself here, rather than
 a kip in the public barracks, was well fueled. Bo swallowed a tablet
 and made his way to the visi and dialed. The robo-clerk summoned
 Lundgard down to the desk.


 It was a lean, muscular face under close cropped brown hair which
 appeared in the screen. Lundgard was a tall and supple man, somehow
 neat even without clothes. ""Jonsson,"" said Bo. ""Sorry to get you up,
 but I understood—""


 ""Oh, yes. Are you looking for a spaceman? I heard your ad and I'm
 available.""


 Bo felt his mouth gape open. ""Huh? I never thought—""


 ""We're both lucky, I guess."" Lundgard chuckled. His English had only
 the slightest trace of accent, less than Bo's. ""I thought I was stashed
 here too for the next several months.""


 ""How does a qualified spaceman happen to be marooned?""


 ""I'm with Fireball, was on the
Drake
—heard of what happened to her?""


 Bo nodded, for every spaceman knows exactly what every spaceship is
 doing at any given time. The
Drake
had come to Achilles to pick up
 a cargo of refined thorium for Earth; while she lay in orbit, she had
 somehow lost a few hundred pounds of reaction-mass water from a cracked
 gasket. Why the accident should have occurred, nobody knew ... spacemen
 were not careless about inspections, and what reason would anyone have
 for sabotage? The event had taken place about a month ago, when the
Sirius
was already enroute here; Bo had heard of it in the course of
 shop talk.


 ""I thought she went back anyway,"" he said.


 Lundgard nodded. ""She did. It was the usual question of economics.
 You know what refined fuel water costs in the Belt; also, the delay
 while we got it would have carried Earth and Achilles past optimum
 position, which'd make the trip home that much more expensive. Since we
 had one more man aboard than really required, it was cheaper to leave
 him behind; the difference in mass would make up for the fuel loss. I
 volunteered, even suggested the idea, because ... well, it happened
 during my watch, and even if nobody blamed me I couldn't help feeling
 guilty.""


 Bo understood that kind of loyalty. You couldn't travel space without
 men who had it.


 ""The Company beamed a message: I'd stay here till their schedule
 permitted an undermanned ship to come by, but that wouldn't be for
 maybe months,"" went on Lundgard. ""I can't see sitting on this lump that
 long without so much as a chance at planetfall bonus. If you'll take me
 on, I'm sure the Company will agree; I'll get a message to them on the
 beam right away.""


 ""Take us a while to get back,"" warned Bo. ""We're going to stop off at
 another asteroid to pick up some automatic equipment, and won't go into
 hyperbolic orbit till after that. About six weeks from here to Earth,
 all told.""


 ""Against six months here?"" Lundgard laughed; it emphasized the bright
 charm of his manner. ""Sunblaze. I'll work for free.""


 ""No need to. Bring your papers over tomorrow, huh?""


 The certificate and record were perfectly in order, showing Einar
 Lundgard to be a Spacetech 1/cl with eight years' experience,
 qualified as engineer, astronaut, pilot, and any other of the thousand
 professions which have run into one. They registered articles and shook
 hands on it. ""Call me Bo. It really is my name ... Swedish.""


 ""Another squarehead, eh?"" grinned Lundgard. ""I'm from South America
 myself.""


 ""Notice a year's gap here,"" said Bo, pointing to the service record.
 ""On Venus.""


 ""Oh, yes. I had some fool idea about settling but soon learned better.
 I tried to farm, but when you have to carve your own land out of
 howling desert—Well, let's start some math, shall we?""


 They were lucky, not having to wait their turn at the station computer;
 no other ship was leaving immediately. They fed it the data and
 requirements, and got back columns of numbers: fuel requirements,
 acceleration times, orbital elements. The figures always had to be
 modified, no trip ever turned out just as predicted, but that could be
 done when needed with a slipstick and the little ship's calculator.


 Bo went at his share of the job doggedly, checking and re-checking
 before giving the problem to the machine; Lundgard breezed through it
 and spent his time while waiting for Bo in swapping dirty limericks
 with the tech. He had some good ones.


 The
Sirius
was loaded, inspected, and cleared. A ""scooter"" brought
 her three passengers up to her orbit, they embarked, settled down, and
 waited. At the proper time, acceleration jammed them back in a thunder
 of rockets.


 Bo relaxed against the thrust, thinking of Achilles falling away behind
 them. ""So long,"" he whispered. ""So long, Johnny.""
III


 In another minute, he would be knotted and screaming from the bends,
 and a couple of minutes later he would be dead.


 Bo clamped his teeth together, as if he would grip consciousness in
 his jaws. His hands felt cold and heavy, the hands of a stranger, as
 he fumbled for the supply pouch. It seemed to recede from him, down a
 hollow infinite corridor where echoes talked in a language he did not
 know.


 ""Damn,"" he gasped. ""Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn.""


 He got the pouch open somehow. The stars wheeled around him. There
 were stars buzzing in his head, like cold white fireflies, buzzing and
 buzzing in the enormous ringing emptiness of his skull. Pain jagged
 through him, he felt his eardrums popping as pressure dropped.


 The plastic patch stuck to his metal gauntlet. He peeled it off, trying
 not to howl with the fury ripping in his nerves. His body was slow,
 inert, a thing to fight. There was no more feeling in his back, was he
 dead already?


 Redness flamed before his eyes, red like Valeria's hair blowing across
 the stars. It was sheer reflex which brought his arm around to slap the
 patch over the hole in his suit. The adhesive gripped, drying fast in
 the sucking vacuum. The patch bellied out from internal air pressure,
 straining to break loose and kill him.


 Bo's mind wavered back toward life. He opened the valves wide on his
 tanks, and his thermostatic capacitors pumped heat back into him. For
 a long time he lay there, only lungs and heart had motion. His throat
 felt withered and flayed, but the rasp of air through it was like being
 born again.


 Born, spewed out of an iron womb into a hollowness of stars and cold,
 to lie on naked rock while the enemy hunted him. Bo shuddered and
 wanted to scream again.


 Slowly he groped back toward awareness. His frostbitten back tingled
 as it warmed up again, soon it would be afire. He could feel a hot
 trickling of blood, but it was along his right side. The bullet must
 have spent most of its force punching through the armor, caromed off
 the inside, scratched his ribs, and fallen dead. Next time he probably
 wouldn't be so lucky. A magnetic-driven .30 slug would go through
 a helmet, splashing brains as it passed.


 He turned his head, feeling a great weariness, and looked at the
 gauges. This had cost him a lot of air. There was only about three
 hours worth left. Lundgard could kill him simply by waiting.


 It would be easy to die. He lay on his back, staring up at the stars
 and the spilling cloudy glory of the Milky Way. A warmth was creeping
 back into numbed hands and feet; soon he would be warm all over, and
 sleepy. His eyelids felt heavy, strange that they should be so heavy on
 an asteroid.


 He wanted terribly to sleep.

         Mike Leigh's 

               Topsy-Turvy                 broadly recounts the creation of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Mikado at London's Savoy Theatre in 1885. Perhaps ""broadly"" is putting too fine a point on it. The first hour, in which Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) attempts to sever his ties with W.S. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and the owner of the Savoy, Richard D'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook), is a mess: The order of scenes feels arbitrary, and characters pop up and vanish with bewildering frequency. You might be tempted to vanish, too. (Friends of mine did.) Be patient. Leigh's movies, born of actors' improvisations and loosely shaped, always take a while to find their rhythm--and, frequently, their point. This one finds everything. By the end of its two hours and 40 minutes, Topsy-Turvy has evolved into something extraordinary: a monument to process--to the minutiae of making art. And to something more: the fundamental sadness of people who labor to make beautiful things--who soar--and then come down to a not-so-beautiful earth. 

         It would be charitable to attribute the shapelessness of the early scenes to the characters' own lack of focus, but it would also be inane. As Elvis Mitchell pointed out in 

               Slate                's "","" Leigh's opening shot features an usher who moves along a row of the Savoy Theatre lifting and peering under every seat. That's every seat. You can almost hear Leigh cackling: ""How's this for a fast start?--you bourgeois slaves to narrative."" Inevitably, something does happen: Princess Ida , one of Gilbert and Sullivan's duds, has its premiere, and Gilbert fumes over a review that calls him the monarch of ""topsy-turvydom""--of formulaic plots involving magical elixirs and coins. A heat wave has hit London, theater attendance is down, and Sullivan is itching to go off and become the English Mendelssohn--to write operas and symphonies instead of comic ""soufflés."" Leigh evidently loves the bloodless formality of the scenes between Gilbert and Sullivan, men of opposite tastes and temperaments who only overlap in their work. He must also love that those scenes are narrative dead ends: ""How's this for conflict?--you bourgeois slaves to melodrama."" 

         The wake-up call comes an hour into the movie. Gilbert attends a popular exposition of Japanese culture at Knightsbridge and watches Kabuki routines and women in kimonos pouring green tea (""spinach water""). When a Japanese sword he has purchased falls off his wall, he hefts it; mimes a fight while issuing strangled, samurailike cries; then has a brainstorm. We hear the horns of The Mikado overture, then Leigh cuts to the fully realized opening scene on stage at the Savoy: ""We are gentlemen of Japan …"" Just that chorus is enough to reanimate the audience--to make people sit up and grin. And Leigh's technique of leaping back and forth between the finished Mikado and painstaking scenes of rehearsal has magic in it: You're watching straw, then gold, then straw, then gold. And you see the connection. 

         A central section of the drama is missing. What exactly fired Sullivan up about doing The Mikado ? What was different about this collaboration? No answer. Topsy-Turvy turns into something other than the Gilbert and Sullivan story: a portrait of life in the theater. A group portrait. D'Oyly Carte becomes a quiet third protagonist, a humane businessman. He softly negotiates a salary increase with the company's lead comic (Martin Savage), a neurasthenic junkie. He gently seeks the assurance of a tipsy ingénue (the tremulous Shirley Henderson) that her ""little weakness"" will not re-emerge. In the dressing room, performers gossip and complain, drink and shoot themselves up with drugs. Leigh's ensemble casts strive to be ""microcosms"" of society, so issues of class are ever present. You see it in Sullivan's banter with the working-class musicians in the pit and in Gilbert's with the uppity actors (the movie's posturing middle class), whom he drills on pronunciation and poise. The chorus is presented as some sort of collective folk conscience when it lobbies Gilbert to restore the rashly cut solo (""A more humane Mikado never did in Japan exist"") of the sad, fat fellow (Timothy Spall) in the title role. 

         Who would have predicted that Leigh would make Gilbert and Sullivan into Mike Leigh characters? Gilbert could be a stand-in for Leigh himself--a haughty, ill-humored man with an obsession for tiny details and a glowering dedication to process. Gilbert haggles with his actors over small things that shouldn't resonate but which somehow add up. Leigh's small things add up, too. The joke of The Mikado is that its Japanese lords are thinly disguised English bureaucrats; the joke of Topsy-Turvy is that the opera's English performers seem culturally incapable of playing Japanese. They rehearse in long coats and top hats, and some of the women (and men!) express horror at appearing on stage without corsets. Behind the satire, however, is a reverence for Gilbert and Sullivan: The tempos are slower than modern audiences are used to, and the staging has been stripped of high-camp accretions. I saw a D'Oyly Carte production of The Mikado in the late '70s: It was played fast and to the groundlings and made me never want to see a G&amp;S opera again. Now I can't wait for the next production. 

         Only a lunatic would call Topsy-Turvy , with its lame first hour and host of loose ends, a masterpiece, but by the finale I was ready to have myself committed. The finale itself must have done it. Leigh's endings are often wondrous, and this one is up there with the rooftop scene in High Hopes (1988). The Mikado is a triumph--it would be the Savoy's biggest hit--but there's no transformation in the lives of its makers. Gilbert can't bring himself to reach out to his brokenhearted wife (Lesley Manville), and Sullivan has a melancholy inkling that he has reached his artistic peak. The ingénue, Leonora, is drinking again, toasting herself in the mirror and praising the loveliness of Nature--a Nature that will, of course, destroy her. The final image is of Art: Leonora on stage singing Yum-Yum's sublime ""The sun whose rays are all ablaze …"" As Leigh's camera pulls back over the orchestra and the audience, this movie feels like one of the saddest and loveliest tributes to the lives of artists ever made. Topsy-Turvy leaves you upside down and breathless. 

         Like Mike Leigh, Errol Morris rarely begins a project with a clear idea of what he wants it to be. Sometimes he doesn't end a project with a clear idea of what he wants it to be, either. His newest documentary, 

               Mr. Death : The Rise and Fall of Fred D. Leuchter, Jr.                , kicks up all sorts of messy emotions that his coolly ironic technique can't begin to handle. 

         The director is in his weird element only in the first half-hour, in which he sits his subject down and gets out of his way. Leuchter, who looks a little like the archetypal movie dweeb Charles Martin Smith and has a heavy exurbs-of-Boston accent, explains how he became involved in redesigning problematic electric chairs. ""Excess current cooks the tissue,"" he says, barely suppressing a smirk at his own expertise. ""There've been occasions where a great amount of current has been applied, and the meat actually will come off the executee's bone like the meat coming off a cooked chicken."" Leuchter set about making capital punishment more ""humane."" He moves on to talking about his redesigns for lethal-injection systems, gas chambers, and even a gallows, while underneath, Caleb Sampson provides macabre funhouse music and wistful calliope waltzes. Morris' distance from his subject implies condescension--Leuchter looks like something in a jar. But that's OK, because the man is an interesting specimen. Is he a monster or a humanist committed to eliminating the ""deplawrable tawchaw"" of capital punishment? It could go either way. 

         M r. Death gets into deeper waters when it recounts the trial of Ernst Zundel in Canada for proclaiming that the Holocaust never happened. Zundel hired Leuchter to go to Auschwitz and examine the ""alleged"" gas chambers: Footage (taken by Zundel's cameraman) shows the little man chiseling at walls, vandalizing what even he admits are international shrines. Leuchter smuggled specimens of rock and concrete back to the United States, where chemical analysis revealed no cyanide gas. Furthermore, Leuchter can't figure out how the gas would even have been administered without killing the Nazis themselves--proof, he argues, that mass extermination at Auschwitz never took place. The subsequent ""Leuchter Report"" became the backbone of Zundel's defense (he lost anyway) and of the burgeoning revisionist movement led by David Irving. But if Leuchter became a hero to neo-Nazis, he also became a target of Jewish groups and a pariah even in the execution business. When Morris hooks up with him for the last time, he's in hiding from creditors. 

         Is Leuchter a raving anti-Semite or a pathetic pawn who thrived on having--for the first time in his life--a bit of celebrity? The film suggests the latter. It certainly produces no evidence of malice. Plenty of monstrous insensitivity and hubris, though. Morris uses the Dutch historian Robert Jan van Pelt as a counternarrator: He calls Leuchter ""a fffool "" who didn't have a clue what to look for in a place that had changed enormously in 50 years. ""If he had spent time in the archives,"" says van Pelt, ""he would have found evidence about ventilation systems, ways to introduce Zyclon B into these buildings--but of course I don't think he knows German so it wouldn't have helped very much."" The most devastating rebuttal is from the chemist in charge of the Auschwitz analysis, who explains that the gas wouldn't have penetrated more than 10 microns into the wall (a human hair is 100 microns thick), so by crushing the samples (standard procedure), he had effectively diluted the cyanide 100,000 times. Against all this, Morris shows footage of Leuchter chiseling at Auschwitz and even adds some of his own, along with slow-motion shots of hammers bashing rocks, walls, floors, etc. It's an obscenity. 

         After my rage at Leuchter had subsided, I began to get angry at Morris for aestheticizing that violation--turning it into an ironic art object. The director's beautiful detachment suggests a kind of cowardice. His technique is based on standing back--maintaining a fixed distance--while his subjects hang themselves, and for a while that works stunningly. But at a certain point, isn't it only human to want to engage this man? You don't need to play Mike Wallace and demolish Leuchter on camera. You could just ask him what he makes of, say, van Pelt's assertion that the answer to the riddle of the gas chambers was all over the archives, or what he thought of the chemist's declaration that the test performed for cyanide was the wrong test. Morris can be heard asking one question only: ""Have you ever thought you might be wrong or that you made a mistake?""--sufficiently broad that Leuchter can casually affirm his own inanity. 

         My concern here isn't so much for Leuchter or even the Holocaust revisionists, who'll just think he was sandbagged. The problem is that when a documentary filmmaker seems too scared or cool or arty to violate his own immaculate aesthetic, he ends up weakening his case. He also provides no emotional release, which isn't a small matter when the subject is Holocaust denial. Morris was close enough to Leuchter to have gotten something more, to have gone a little deeper in search of a poison that does penetrate surfaces.

You
 can do a great deal if
 you have enough data, and
 enough time to compute on it,
 by logical methods. But given
 the situation that neither data

 what do you do?
BY JAMES BLISH
Illustrated by van Dongen


 On the day that the Polish freighter
Ludmilla
laid an egg in New
 York harbor, Abner Longmans
 (""One-Shot"") Braun was in the city
 going about his normal business,
 which was making another million
 dollars. As we found out later, almost
 nothing else was normal about
 that particular week end for Braun.
 For one thing, he had brought his
 family with him—a complete departure
 from routine—reflecting the unprecedentedly
 legitimate nature of
 the deals he was trying to make.
 From every point of view it was a
 bad week end for the CIA to mix
 into his affairs, but nobody had explained
 that to the master of the
Ludmilla
.


 I had better add here that we
 knew nothing about this until afterward;
 from the point of view of the
 storyteller, an organization like Civilian
 Intelligence Associates gets to
 all its facts backwards, entering the
 tale at the pay-off, working back to
 the hook, and winding up with a
 sheaf of background facts to feed
 into the computer for Next Time. It's
 rough on the various people who've
 tried to fictionalize what we do—particularly
 for the lazy examples of
 the breed, who come to us expecting
 that their plotting has already been
 done for them—but it's inherent in
 the way we operate, and there it is.


 Certainly nobody at CIA so much
 as thought of Braun when the news
 first came through. Harry Anderton,
 the Harbor Defense chief, called us
 at 0830 Friday to take on the job of
 identifying the egg; this was when
 our records show us officially entering
 the affair, but, of course, Anderton
 had been keeping the wires to
 Washington steaming for an hour before
 that, getting authorization to
 spend some of his money on us (our
 clearance status was then and is now
 C&amp;R—clean and routine).


 I was in the central office when
 the call came through, and had some
 difficulty in making out precisely
 what Anderton wanted of us. ""Slow
 down, Colonel Anderton, please,"" I
 begged him. ""Two or three seconds
 won't make that much difference.
 How did you find out about this egg
 in the first place?""


 ""The automatic compartment bulkheads
 on the
Ludmilla
were defective,""
 he said. ""It seems that this
 egg was buried among a lot of other
 crates in the dump-cell of the
 hold—""


 ""What's a dump cell?""


 ""It's a sea lock for getting rid of
 dangerous cargo. The bottom of it
 opens right to Davy Jones. Standard
 fitting for ships carrying explosives,
 radioactives, anything that might act
 up unexpectedly.""


 ""All right,"" I said. ""Go ahead.""


 ""Well, there was a timer on the
 dump-cell floor, set to drop the egg
 when the ship came up the river.
 That worked fine, but the automatic
 bulkheads that are supposed to keep
 the rest of the ship from being flooded
 while the cell's open, didn't. At
 least they didn't do a thorough job.
 The
Ludmilla
began to list and the
 captain yelled for help. When the
 Harbor Patrol found the dump-cell
 open, they called us in.""


 ""I see."" I thought about it a moment.
 ""In other words, you don't
 know whether the
Ludmilla
really
 laid an egg or not.""


 ""That's what I keep trying to explain
 to you, Dr. Harris. We don't
 know what she dropped and we
 haven't any way of finding out. It
 could be a bomb—it could be anything.
 We're sweating everybody on
 board the ship now, but it's my guess
 that none of them know anything;
 the whole procedure was designed to
 be automatic.""


 ""All right, we'll take it,"" I said.
 ""You've got divers down?""


 ""Sure, but—""


 ""We'll worry about the buts from
 here on. Get us a direct line from
 your barge to the big board here so
 we can direct the work. Better get
 on over here yourself.""


 ""Right."" He sounded relieved.
 Official people have a lot of confidence
 in CIA; too much, in my estimation.
 Some day the job will come
 along that we can't handle, and then
 Washington will be kicking itself—or,
 more likely, some scapegoat—for
 having failed to develop a comparable
 government department.


 Not that there was much prospect
 of Washington's doing that. Official
 thinking had been running in the
 other direction for years. The precedent
 was the Associated Universities
 organization which ran Brookhaven;
 CIA had been started the same way,
 by a loose corporation of universities
 and industries all of which had
 wanted to own an ULTIMAC and
 no one of which had had the money
 to buy one for itself. The Eisenhower
 administration, with its emphasis
 on private enterprise and concomitant
 reluctance to sink federal
 funds into projects of such size, had
 turned the two examples into a nice
 fat trend, which ULTIMAC herself
 said wasn't going to be reversed
 within the practicable lifetime of
 CIA.
I buzzed for two staffers, and in
 five minutes got Clark Cheyney and
 Joan Hadamard, CIA's business manager
 and social science division chief
 respectively. The titles were almost
 solely for the benefit of the T/O—that
 is, Clark and Joan do serve in
 those capacities, but said service takes
 about two per cent of their capacities
 and their time. I shot them a couple
 of sentences of explanation, trusting
 them to pick up whatever else they
 needed from the tape, and checked
 the line to the divers' barge.


 It was already open; Anderton had
 gone to work quickly and with decision
 once he was sure we were taking
 on the major question. The television
 screen lit, but nothing showed
 on it but murky light, striped with
 streamers of darkness slowly rising
 and falling. The audio went
cloonck
...
oing
,
oing
...
bonk
...
oing
... Underwater noises, shapeless
 and characterless.


 ""Hello, out there in the harbor.
 This is CIA, Harris calling. Come in,
 please.""


 ""Monig here,"" the audio said.
Boink
...
oing
,
oing
...


 ""Got anything yet?""


 ""Not a thing, Dr. Harris,"" Monig
 said. ""You can't see three inches in
 front of your face down here—it's
 too silty. We've bumped into a couple
 of crates, but so far, no egg.""


 ""Keep trying.""


 Cheyney, looking even more like
 a bulldog than usual, was setting his
 stopwatch by one of the eight clocks
 on ULTIMAC's face. ""Want me to
 take the divers?"" he said.


 ""No, Clark, not yet. I'd rather
 have Joan do it for the moment."" I
 passed the mike to her. ""You'd better
 run a probability series first.""


 ""Check."" He began feeding tape
 into the integrator's mouth. ""What's
 your angle, Peter?""


 ""The ship. I want to see how heavily
 shielded that dump-cell is.""


 ""It isn't shielded at all,"" Anderton's
 voice said behind me. I hadn't
 heard him come in. ""But that doesn't
 prove anything. The egg might have
 carried sufficient shielding in itself.
 Or maybe the Commies didn't care
 whether the crew was exposed or not.
 Or maybe there isn't any egg.""


 ""All that's possible,"" I admitted.
 ""But I want to see it, anyhow.""


 ""Have you taken blood tests?""
 Joan asked Anderton.


 ""Yes.""


 ""Get the reports through to me,
 then. I want white-cell counts, differentials,
 platelet counts, hematocrit
 and sed rates on every man.""


 Anderton picked up the phone and
 I took a firm hold on the doorknob.


 ""Hey,"" Anderton said, putting the
 phone down again. ""Are you going
 to duck out just like that? Remember,
 Dr. Harris, we've got to evacuate the
 city first of all! No matter whether
 it's a real egg or not—we can't take
 the chance on it's
not
being an egg!""


 ""Don't move a man until you get
 a go-ahead from CIA,"" I said. ""For
 all we know now, evacuating the city
 may be just what the enemy wants us
 to do—so they can grab it unharmed.
 Or they may want to start a panic
 for some other reason, any one of
 fifty possible reasons.""


 ""You can't take such a gamble,""
 he said grimly. ""There are eight and
 a half million lives riding on it. I
 can't let you do it.""


 ""You passed your authority to us
 when you hired us,"" I pointed out.
 ""If you want to evacuate without our
 O.K., you'll have to fire us first. It'll
 take another hour to get that cleared
 from Washington—so you might as
 well give us the hour.""


 He stared at me for a moment, his
 lips thinned. Then he picked up the
 phone again to order Joan's blood
 count, and I got out the door, fast.
A reasonable man would have said
 that I found nothing useful on the
Ludmilla
, except negative information.
 But the fact is that anything I
 found would have been a surprise to
 me; I went down looking for surprises.
 I found nothing but a faint
 trail to Abner Longmans Braun, most
 of which was fifteen years cold.


 There'd been a time when I'd
 known Braun, briefly and to no
 profit to either of us. As an undergraduate
 majoring in social sciences,
 I'd taken on a term paper on the old
 International Longshoreman's Association,
 a racket-ridden union now
 formally extinct—although anyone
 who knew the signs could still pick
 up some traces on the docks. In those
 days, Braun had been the business
 manager of an insurance firm, the
 sole visible function of which had
 been to write policies for the ILA
 and its individual dock-wallopers.
 For some reason, he had been amused
 by the brash youngster who'd barged
 in on him and demanded the lowdown,
 and had shown me considerable
 lengths of ropes not normally
 in view of the public—nothing incriminating,
 but enough to give me
 a better insight into how the union
 operated than I had had any right to
 expect—or even suspect.


 Hence I was surprised to hear
 somebody on the docks remark that
 Braun was in the city over the week
 end. It would never have occurred
 to me that he still interested himself
 in the waterfront, for he'd gone respectable
 with a vengeance. He was
 still a professional gambler, and according
 to what he had told the
 Congressional Investigating Committee
 last year, took in thirty to fifty
 thousand dollars a year at it, but his
 gambles were no longer concentrated
 on horses, the numbers, or shady insurance
 deals. Nowadays what he did
 was called investment—mostly in real
 estate; realtors knew him well as the
 man who had
almost
bought the Empire
 State Building. (The
almost
in
 the equation stands for the moment
 when the shoestring broke.)


 Joan had been following his career,
 too, not because she had ever met
 him, but because for her he was a
 type study in the evolution of what
 she called ""the extra-legal ego.""
 ""With personalities like that, respectability
 is a disease,"" she told me.
 ""There's always an almost-open conflict
 between the desire to be powerful
 and the desire to be accepted;
 your ordinary criminal is a moral imbecile,
 but people like Braun are
 damned with a conscience, and sooner
 or later they crack trying to appease
 it.""


 ""I'd sooner try to crack a Timkin
 bearing,"" I said. ""Braun's ten-point
 steel all the way through.""


 ""Don't you believe it. The symptoms
 are showing all over him. Now
 he's backing Broadway plays, sponsoring
 beginning actresses, joining
 playwrights' groups—he's the only
 member of Buskin and Brush who's
 never written a play, acted in one, or
 so much as pulled the rope to raise
 the curtain.""


 ""That's investment,"" I said.
 ""That's his business.""


 ""Peter, you're only looking at the
 surface. His real investments almost
 never fail. But the plays he backs
always
do. They have to; he's sinking
 money in them to appease his conscience,
 and if they were to succeed it
 would double his guilt instead of
 salving it. It's the same way with the
 young actresses. He's not sexually
 interested in them—his type never is,
 because living a rigidly orthodox
 family life is part of the effort towards
 respectability. He's backing
 them to 'pay his debt to society'—in
 other words, they're talismans to
 keep him out of jail.""


 ""It doesn't seem like a very satisfactory
 substitute.""


 ""Of course it isn't,"" Joan had said.
 ""The next thing he'll do is go in for
 direct public service—giving money
 to hospitals or something like that.
 You watch.""


 She had been right; within the
 year, Braun had announced the
 founding of an association for clearing
 the Detroit slum area where he
 had been born—the plainest kind of
 symbolic suicide:
Let's not have any
 more Abner Longmans Brauns born
 down here
. It depressed me to see it
 happen, for next on Joan's agenda
 for Braun was an entry into politics
 as a fighting liberal—a New Dealer
 twenty years too late. Since I'm mildly
 liberal myself when I'm off duty,
 I hated to think what Braun's career
 might tell me about my own motives,
 if I'd let it.
All of which had nothing to do
 with why I was prowling around the
Ludmilla
—or did it? I kept remembering
 Anderton's challenge: ""You
 can't take such a gamble. There are
 eight and a half million lives riding
 on it—"" That put it up into Braun's
 normal operating area, all right. The
 connection was still hazy, but on the
 grounds that any link might be useful,
 I phoned him.


 He remembered me instantly; like
 most uneducated, power-driven men,
 he had a memory as good as any machine's.


 ""You never did send me that paper
 you was going to write,"" he said. His
 voice seemed absolutely unchanged,
 although he was in his seventies now.
 ""You promised you would.""


 ""Kids don't keep their promises
 as well as they should,"" I said. ""But
 I've still got copies and I'll see to it
 that you get one, this time. Right
 now I need another favor—something
 right up your alley.""


 ""CIA business?""


 ""Yes. I didn't know you knew I
 was with CIA.""


 Braun chuckled. ""I still know a
 thing or two,"" he said. ""What's the
 angle?""


 ""That I can't tell you over the
 phone. But it's the biggest gamble
 there ever was, and I think we need
 an expert. Can you come down to
 CIA's central headquarters right
 away?""


 ""Yeah, if it's that big. If it ain't,
 I got lots of business here, Andy.
 And I ain't going to be in town long.
 You're sure it's top stuff?""


 ""My word on it.""


 He was silent a moment. Then he
 said, ""Andy, send me your paper.""


 ""The paper? Sure, but—"" Then I
 got it. I'd given him my word.
 ""You'll get it,"" I said. ""Thanks, Mr.
 Braun.""


 I called headquarters and sent a
 messenger to my apartment to look
 for one of those long-dusty blue folders
 with the legal-length sheets inside
 them, with orders to scorch it over
 to Braun without stopping to breathe
 more than once. Then I went back
 myself.


 The atmosphere had changed. Anderton
 was sitting by the big desk,
 clenching his fists and sweating; his
 whole posture telegraphed his controlled
 helplessness. Cheyney was
 bent over a seismograph, echo-sounding
 for the egg through the river
 bottom. If that even had a prayer of
 working, I knew, he'd have had the
 trains of the Hudson &amp; Manhattan
 stopped; their rumbling course
 through their tubes would have
 blanked out any possible echo-pip
 from the egg.


 ""Wild goose chase?"" Joan said,
 scanning my face.


 ""Not quite. I've got something, if
 I can just figure out what it is. Remember
 One-Shot Braun?""


 ""Yes. What's he got to do with
 it?""


 ""Nothing,"" I said. ""But I want
 to bring him in. I don't think we'll
 lick this project before deadline without
 him.""


 ""What good is a professional
 gambler on a job like this? He'll just
 get in the way.""


 I looked toward the television
 screen, which now showed an
 amorphous black mass, jutting up
 from a foundation of even deeper
 black. ""Is that operation getting you
 anywhere?""


 ""Nothing's gotten us anywhere,""
 Anderton interjected harshly. ""We
 don't even know if that's the egg—the
 whole area is littered with crates.
 Harris, you've got to let me get that
 alert out!""


 ""Clark, how's the time going?""


 Cheyney consulted the stopwatch.
 ""Deadline in twenty-nine minutes,""
 he said.


 ""All right, let's use those minutes.
 I'm beginning to see this thing
 a little clearer. Joan, what we've got
 here is a one-shot gamble; right?""


 ""In effect,"" she said cautiously.


 ""And it's my guess that we're
 never going to get the answer by
 diving for it—not in time, anyhow.
 Remember when the Navy lost a
 barge-load of shells in the harbor,
 back in '52? They scrabbled for them
 for a year and never pulled up a one;
 they finally had to warn the public
 that if it found anything funny-looking
 along the shore it shouldn't bang
 said object, or shake it either. We're
 better equipped than the Navy was
 then—but we're working against a
 deadline.""


 ""If you'd admitted that earlier,""
 Anderton said hoarsely, ""we'd have
 half a million people out of the city
 by now. Maybe even a million.""


 ""We haven't given up yet, colonel.
 The point is this, Joan: what
 we need is an inspired guess. Get
 anything from the prob series, Clark?
 I thought not. On a one-shot gamble
 of this kind, the 'laws' of chance are
 no good at all. For that matter, the
 so-called ESP experiments showed us
 long ago that even the way we construct
 random tables is full of holes—and
 that a man with a feeling for
 the essence of a gamble can make a
 monkey out of chance almost at will.


 ""And if there ever was such a
 man, Braun is it. That's why I asked
 him to come down here. I want him
 to look at that lump on the screen
 and—play a hunch.""


 ""You're out of your mind,"" Anderton
 said.
A decorous knock spared me the
 trouble of having to deny, affirm or
 ignore the judgment. It was Braun;
 the messenger had been fast, and
 the gambler hadn't bothered to read
 what a college student had thought
 of him fifteen years ago. He came
 forward and held out his hand, while
 the others looked him over frankly.


 He was impressive, all right. It
 would have been hard for a stranger
 to believe that he was aiming at respectability;
 to the eye, he was already
 there. He was tall and spare,
 and walked perfectly erect, not without
 spring despite his age. His clothing
 was as far from that of a
 gambler as you could have taken it
 by design: a black double-breasted
 suit with a thin vertical stripe, a gray
 silk tie with a pearl stickpin just
 barely large enough to be visible at
 all, a black Homburg; all perfectly
 fitted, all worn with proper casualness—one
 might almost say a formal
 casualness. It was only when he
 opened his mouth that One-Shot
 Braun was in the suit with him.


 ""I come over as soon as your runner
 got to me,"" he said. ""What's the
 pitch, Andy?""


 ""Mr. Braun, this is Joan Hadamard,
 Clark Cheyney, Colonel Anderton.
 I'll be quick because we need
 speed now. A Polish ship has dropped
 something out in the harbor.
 We don't know what it is. It may be
 a hell-bomb, or it may be just somebody's
 old laundry. Obviously we've
 got to find out which—and we want
 you to tell us.""


 Braun's aristocratic eyebrows went
 up. ""Me? Hell, Andy, I don't know
 nothing about things like that. I'm
 surprised with you. I thought CIA
 had all the brains it needed—ain't
 you got machines to tell you answers
 like that?""


 I pointed silently to Joan, who had
 gone back to work the moment the
 introductions were over. She was still
 on the mike to the divers. She was
 saying: ""What does it look like?""


 ""It's just a lump of something,
 Dr. Hadamard. Can't even tell its
 shape—it's buried too deeply in the
 mud.""
Cloonk
...
Oing
,
oing
...


 ""Try the Geiger.""


 ""We did. Nothing but background.""


 ""Scintillation counter?""


 ""Nothing, Dr. Hadamard. Could
 be it's shielded.""


 ""Let us do the guessing, Monig.
 All right, maybe it's got a clockwork
 fuse that didn't break with the impact.
 Or a gyroscopic fuse. Stick a
 stethoscope on it and see if you pick
 up a ticking or anything that sounds
 like a motor running.""
There was a lag and I turned back
 to Braun. ""As you can see, we're
 stymied. This is a long shot, Mr.
 Braun. One throw of the dice—one
 show-down hand. We've got to have
 an expert call it for us—somebody
 with a record of hits on long shots.
 That's why I called you.""


 ""It's no good,"" he said. He took
 off the Homburg, took his handkerchief
 from his breast pocket, and
 wiped the hatband. ""I can't do it.""


 ""Why not?""


 ""It ain't my
kind
of thing,"" he
 said. ""Look, I never in my life run
 odds on anything that made any difference.
 But this makes a difference.
 If I guess wrong—""


 ""Then we're all dead ducks. But
 why should you guess wrong? Your
 hunches have been working for sixty
 years now.""


 Braun wiped his face. ""No. You
 don't get it. I wish you'd listen to
 me. Look, my wife and my kids are
 in the city. It ain't only my life, it's
 theirs, too. That's what I care about.
 That's why it's no good. On things
 that matter to me,
my hunches don't
 work
.""


 I was stunned, and so, I could see,
 were Joan and Cheyney. I suppose I
 should have guessed it, but it had
 never occurred to me.


 ""Ten minutes,"" Cheyney said.


 I looked up at Braun. He was
 frightened, and again I was surprised
 without having any right to
 be. I tried to keep at least my voice
 calm.


 ""Please try it anyhow, Mr. Braun—as
 a favor. It's already too late to
 do it any other way. And if you guess
 wrong, the outcome won't be any
 worse than if you don't try at all.""


 ""My kids,"" he whispered. I don't
 think he knew that he was speaking
 aloud. I waited.


 Then his eyes seemed to come back
 to the present. ""All right,"" he said.
 ""I told you the truth, Andy. Remember
 that. So—is it a bomb or ain't it?
 That's what's up for grabs, right?""


 I nodded. He closed his eyes. An
 unexpected stab of pure fright went
 down my back. Without the eyes,
 Braun's face was a death mask.


 The water sounds and the irregular
 ticking of a Geiger counter
 seemed to spring out from the audio
 speaker, four times as loud as before.
 I could even hear the pen of
 the seismograph scribbling away, until
 I looked at the instrument and
 saw that Clark had stopped it, probably
 long ago.


 Droplets of sweat began to form
 along Braun's forehead and his upper
 lip. The handkerchief remained
 crushed in his hand.


 Anderton said, ""Of all the fool—""


 ""Hush!"" Joan said quietly.
Slowly, Braun opened his eyes.
 ""All right,"" he said. ""You guys
 wanted it this way.
I say it's a bomb.
""
 He stared at us for a moment more—and
 then, all at once, the Timkin
 bearing burst. Words poured out of
 it. ""Now you guys do something, do
 your job like I did mine—get my
 wife and kids out of there—empty
 the city—do something,
do something
!""


 Anderton was already grabbing
 for the phone. ""You're right, Mr.
 Braun. If it isn't already too late—""


 Cheyney shot out a hand and
 caught Anderton's telephone arm by
 the wrist. ""Wait a minute,"" he said.


 ""What d'you mean, 'wait a minute'?
 Haven't you already shot
 enough time?""


 Cheyney did not let go; instead,
 he looked inquiringly at Joan and
 said, ""One minute, Joan. You might
 as well go ahead.""


 She nodded and spoke into the
 mike. ""Monig, unscrew the cap.""


 ""Unscrew the cap?"" the audio
 squawked. ""But Dr. Hadamard, if
 that sets it off—""


 ""It won't go off. That's the one
 thing you can be sure it won't do.""


 ""What is this?"" Anderton demanded.
 ""And what's this deadline
 stuff, anyhow?""


 ""The cap's off,"" Monig reported.
 ""We're getting plenty of radiation
 now. Just a minute— Yeah. Dr.
 Hadamard, it's a bomb, all right.
 But it hasn't got a fuse. Now how
 could they have made a fool mistake
 like that?""


 ""In other words, it's a dud,"" Joan
 said.


 ""That's right, a dud.""


 Now, at last, Braun wiped his face,
 which was quite gray. ""I told you
 the truth,"" he said grimly. ""My
 hunches don't work on stuff like
 this.""


 ""But they do,"" I said. ""I'm sorry
 we put you through the wringer—and
 you too, colonel—but we couldn't
 let an opportunity like this slip.
 It was too good a chance for us to
 test how our facilities would stand
 up in a real bomb-drop.""


 ""A real drop?"" Anderton said.
 ""Are you trying to say that CIA
 staged this? You ought to be shot,
 the whole pack of you!""


 ""No, not exactly,"" I said. ""The
 enemy's responsible for the drop, all
 right. We got word last month from
 our man in Gdynia that they were
 going to do it, and that the bomb
 would be on board the
Ludmilla
. As
 I say, it was too good an opportunity
 to miss. We wanted to find out just
 how long it would take us to figure
 out the nature of the bomb—which
 we didn't know in detail—after it
 was dropped here. So we had our
 people in Gdynia defuse the thing
 after it was put on board the ship,
 but otherwise leave it entirely alone.


 ""Actually, you see, your hunch was
 right on the button as far as it went.
 We didn't ask you whether or not
 that object was a live bomb. We
 asked whether it was a bomb or not.
 You said it was, and you were right.""


 The expression on Braun's face
 was exactly like the one he had worn
 while he had been searching for his
 decision—except that, since his eyes
 were open, I could see that it was
 directed at me. ""If this was the old
 days,"" he said in an ice-cold voice,
 ""I might of made the colonel's idea
 come true. I don't go for tricks like
 this, Andy.""


 ""It was more than a trick,"" Clark
 put in. ""You'll remember we had
 a deadline on the test, Mr. Braun.
 Obviously, in a real drop we wouldn't
 have all the time in the world
 to figure out what kind of a thing
 had been dropped. If we had still
 failed to establish that when the
 deadline ran out, we would have
 had to allow evacuation of the city,
 with all the attendant risk that that
 was exactly what the enemy wanted
 us to do.""


 ""So?""


 ""So we failed the test,"" I said. ""At
 one minute short of the deadline,
 Joan had the divers unscrew the cap.
 In a real drop that would have resulted
 in a detonation, if the bomb
 was real; we'd never risk it. That
 we did do it in the test was a concession
 of failure—an admission that
 our usual methods didn't come
 through for us in time.


 ""And that means that you were
 the only person who did come
 through, Mr. Braun. If a real bomb-drop
 ever comes, we're going to have
 to have you here, as an active part of
 our investigation. Your intuition for
 the one-shot gamble was the one
 thing that bailed us out this time.
 Next time it may save eight million
 lives.""


 There was quite a long silence. All
 of us, Anderton included, watched
 Braun intently, but his impassive
 face failed to show any trace of how
 his thoughts were running.


 When he did speak at last, what
 he said must have seemed insanely
 irrelevant to Anderton, and maybe
 to Cheyney too. And perhaps it
 meant nothing more to Joan than
 the final clinical note in a case history.


 ""It's funny,"" he said, ""I was
 thinking of running for Congress
 next year from my district. But maybe
 this is more important.""


 It was, I believe, the sigh of a man
 at peace with himself.

Many publishers who oppose OA concede that OA is better for research and researchers than toll access.
 
                                          They merely object that we can’t pay for it. But we can pay for it.
The first major study of the economic impact of OA policies was conducted by John Houghton and Peter Sheehan in 2006. Using conservative estimates that a nation’s gross expenditure on research and development (GERD) brings social returns of 50 percent, and that OA increases access and efficiency by 5 percent, Houghton and Sheehan calculated that a transition to OA would not only pay for itself, but add $1.7 billion/year to the UK economy and $16 billion/year to the U.S. economy. A later study focusing on Australia used the more conservative estimate that GERD brings social returns of only 25 percent, but still found that the bottom-line economic benefits of OA for publicly funded research were 51 times greater than the costs.
Independent confirmation of Houghton’s results came in a major study released in April 2011, commissioned by the UK Joint Information Systems Committee, Publishing Research Consortium, Research Information Network, Research Libraries UK, and the Wellcome Trust. After studying five scenarios for improving research access, it concluded that green and gold OA “offer the greatest potential to policy-makers in promoting access. Both have positive, and potentially high, BCRs [benefit-cost ratios]. . . .”
The same study noted that “the infrastructure for Green [OA] has largely already been built” and therefore that “increasing access by this route is especially cost-effective. . . .” I can add that repositories scale up more easily than journals to capture unmet demand, and that depositing in a repository costs the depositor nothing. For all these reasons, I’ll focus in this chapter on how to pay for gold OA (journals), not how to pay for green OA (repositories).
Before turning to gold OA, however, I should note that there are widely varying estimates in the literature on what it costs a university to run an institutional repository. The divergence reflects the fact that repositories can serve many different purposes, and that some repositories serve more of them than others. If the minimum purpose is to host OA copies of faculty articles, and if faculty deposit their own articles, then the cost is minimal. But a repository is a general-purpose tool, and once launched there are good reasons for it to take on other responsibilities, such as long-term preservation, assisting faculty with digitization, permissions, and deposits, and hosting many other sorts of content, such as theses and dissertations, books or book chapters, conference proceedings, courseware, campus publications, digitized special collections, and administrative records. If the average repository is a significant expense today, the reason is that the average repository is doing significantly more than the minimum.
OA journals pay their bills the way broadcast television and radio stations do—not through advertising or pledge drives, but through a simple generalization on advertising and pledge drives. Those with an interest in disseminating the content pay the production costs upfront so that access can be free of charge for everyone with the right equipment. Elsewhere I’ve called this the “some pay for all” model.
Some OA journals have a subsidy from a university, library, foundation, society, museum, or government agency. Other OA journals charge a publication fee on accepted articles, to be paid by the author or the author’s sponsor (employer or funder). The party paying the subsidy or fee covers the journal’s expenses and readers pay nothing.
OA journals that charge publication fees tend to waive them in cases of economic hardship, and journals with institutional subsidies tend not to charge publication fees. OA journals can diversify their funding and get by on lower subsidies, or lower fees, if they also have revenue from print editions, advertising, priced add-ons, or auxiliary services. Some institutions and consortia arrange fee discounts, or purchase annual memberships that include fee waivers or discounts for all affiliated researchers.
Models that work well in some fields and nations may not work as well in others. No one claims that one size fits all. There’s still room for creativity in finding ways to pay the costs of a peer-reviewed OA journal, and many smart and motivated people are exploring different possibilities. Journals announce new variations almost every week, and we’re far from exhausting our cleverness and imagination.
Green OA may suffer from invisibility, but gold OA does not. On the contrary, researchers who don’t know about OA repositories still understand that there are OA journals. Sometimes the visibility gap is so large that researchers, journalists, and policy-makers conclude that all OA is gold OA (see section 3.1 on green and gold OA). As a result, most researchers who think about the benefits of OA think about the benefits of gold OA. Here, at least, the news is good. The most comprehensive survey to date shows that an overwhelming 89 percent of researchers from all fields believe that OA journals are beneficial to their fields.
Apart from the myth that all OA is gold OA, the most common myth about gold OA is that all OA journals charge “author fees” or use an “author-pays” business model. There are three mistakes here. The first is to assume that there is only one business model for OA journals, when there are many. The second is to assume that charging an upfront fee means authors are the ones expected to pay it. The third is to assume that all or even most OA journals charge upfront fees. In fact, most OA journals (70 percent) charge no upfront or author-side fees at all. By contrast, most toll-access journals (75 percent) do charge author-side fees. Moreover, even within the minority of fee-based OA journals, only 12 percent of those authors end up paying the fees out of pocket. Almost 90 percent of the time, the fees at fee-based journals are waived or paid by sponsors on behalf of authors.
Terminology
The terms “author fees” and “author pays” are specious and damaging. They’re false for the majority of OA journals, which charge no fees. They’re also misleading even for fee-based OA journals, where nearly nine times out of ten the fees are not paid by authors themselves. It’s more accurate to speak of “publication fees,” “processing fees,” or “author-side fees.” The first two don’t specify the payor, and the third merely specifies that the payment comes from the author side of the transaction, rather than the reader side, without implying that it must come from authors themselves.
The false beliefs that most OA journals charge author-side fees and that most toll-access journals don’t have caused several kinds of harm. They scare authors away from OA journals. They support the misconception that gold OA excludes indigent authors. When we add in the background myth that all OA is gold OA, this misconception suggests that OA as such—and not just gold OA—excludes indigent authors.
These false beliefs also support the insinuation that OA journals are more likely than non-OA journals to compromise on peer review. But if charging author-side fees for accepted papers really creates an incentive to lower standards, in order to rake in more fees, then most toll-access journals are guilty and most OA journals are not. In fact, however, when OA journals do charge author-side fees, they create firewalls between their financial and editorial operations. For example, most fee-based OA journals will waive their fees in cases of economic hardship, and take pains to prevent editors and referees engaged in peer review from knowing whether or not an author has requested a fee waiver. By contrast, at toll-access journals levying author-side page or color charges, editors generally know that accepted papers will entail revenue.
The false belief that most OA journals charge author-side fees also infects studies in which authors misinform survey subjects before surveying them. In effect: “At OA journals, authors pay to be published; now let me ask you a series of questions about your attitude toward OA journals.”
Finally, this false belief undermines calculations about who would bear the financial brunt if we made a general transition from toll-access journals to OA journals. A handful of studies have calculated that after a general conversion of peer-reviewed journals to OA, high-output universities would pay more in author-side fees than they pay now in subscriptions. These calculations make at least two assumptions unjustified by present facts or trends: that all OA journals would charge fees, and that all fees would be paid by universities.
There are two kinds of OA journals, full and hybrid. Full OA journals provide OA to all their research articles. Hybrid OA journals provide OA to some and toll-access to others, when the choice is the author’s rather than the editor’s. Most hybrid OA journals charge a publication fee for the OA option. Authors who can find the money get immediate OA, and those who can’t or prefer not to, get toll access. (Many hybrid OA journals provide OA to all their articles after some time period, such as a year.) Some hybrid OA journals promise to reduce subscription prices in proportion to author uptake of the OA option, that is, to charge subscribers only for the toll-access articles. But most hybrid journal publishers don’t make this promise and “double dip” by charging subscription fees and publication fees for the same OA articles.
Hybrid OA is very low-risk for publishers. If the OA option has low uptake, the publisher loses nothing and still has subscription revenue. If it has high uptake, the publisher has subscription revenue for the conventional articles, publication fees for the OA articles, and sometimes both at once for the OA articles. Hence, the model has spread far and fast. The Professional/Scholarly Publishing division of the Association of American Publishers reported in 2011 that 74 percent of surveyed journals offering some form of OA in 2009 offered hybrid OA. At the same time, SHERPA listed more than 90 publishers offering hybrid OA options, including all of the largest publishers. Despite its spread, hybrid OA journals do little or nothing to help researchers, libraries, or publishers. The average rate of uptake for the OA option at hybrid journals is just 2 percent.
The chief virtue of hybrid OA journals is that they give publishers some firsthand experience with the economics and logistics of OA publishing. But the economics are artificial, since hybrid OA publishers have no incentive to increase author uptake and make the model succeed. The publishers always have subscriptions to fall back on. Moreover, an overwhelming majority of full-OA journals charge no publication fees and the overwhelming majority of hybrid-OA journals never gain firsthand experience with no-fee business models.
A growing number of for-profit OA publishers are making profits, and a growing number of nonprofit OA publishers are breaking even or making surpluses. Two different business models drive these sustainable publishing programs. BioMed Central makes profits and the Public Library of Science makes surpluses by charging publication fees. MedKnow makes profits without charging publication fees by selling priced print editions of its OA journals.
Fee-based OA journals tend to work best in fields where most research is funded, and no-fee journals tend to work best in fields and countries where comparatively little research is funded. The successes of these two business models give hope that gold OA can be sustainable in every discipline.
Every kind of peer-reviewed journal can become more sustainable by reducing costs. Although peer review is generally performed by unpaid volunteers, organizing or facilitating peer review is an expense. The journal must select referees, distribute files to referees, monitor who has what, track progress, nag dawdlers, collect comments and share them with the right people, facilitate communication, distinguish versions, and collect data on acceptances and rejections. One powerful way to reduce costs without reducing quality is to use free and open-source journal management software to automate the clerical tasks on this list.
The leader in this field is Open Journal Systems from the Public Knowledge Project, but there are more than a dozen other open-source packages. While OJS or other open-source software could benefit even toll-access journals, their use is concentrated among OA journals. OJS alone is has more than 9,000 installations (though not all are used for managing journals). This is not merely an example of how one openness movement can help another but also of how fearing openness can lead conventional publishers to forgo financial benefits and leave money on the table.
There are reasons to think that OA journals cost less to produce than toll-access journals of the same quality. OA journals dispense with subscription management (soliciting, negotiating, tracking, renewing subscribers), dispense with digital rights management (authenticating users, distinguishing authorized from unauthorized, blocking access to unauthorized), eliminate legal fees for licensing (drafting, negotiating, monitoring, and enforcing restrictive licenses), and reduce or eliminate marketing. In their place they add back little more than the cost of collecting publication fees or institutional subsidies. Several studies and OA publishers have testified to these lower costs.
We shouldn’t count the savings from dropping print, since most toll-access journals in the sciences have already dropped their print editions and those in the humanities are moving in the same direction.
We should be suspicious when large, venerable, conventional publishers say that in their experience the economics of OA publishing don’t work. Print-era publishers retooling for digital, and toll-access publishers retooling for OA, will inevitably realize smaller savings from OA than lean, mean OA start-ups without legacy equipment, personnel, or overhead from the age of print and subscriptions.
About one-quarter of all peer-reviewed journals today are OA. Like toll-access journals, some are in the black and thriving and some are in the red and struggling. However, the full range of OA journals begins to look like a success story when we consider that the vast majority of the money needed to support peer-reviewed journals is currently tied up in subscriptions to conventional journals. OA journals have reached their current numbers and quality despite the extraordinary squeeze on budgets devoted to the support of peer-reviewed journals.
Even if OA journals had the same production costs as toll-access journals, there’s enough money in the system to pay for peer-reviewed OA journals in every niche where we currently have peer-reviewed toll-access journals, and at the same level of quality. In fact, there’s more than enough, since we wouldn’t have to pay publisher profit margins surpassing those at ExxonMobil. Jan Velterop, the former publisher of BioMed Central, once said that OA publishing can be profitable but will “bring profit margins more in line with the added value.”
To support a full range of high-quality OA journals, we don’t need new money. We only need to redirect money we’re currently spending on peer-reviewed journals.
                                         
                                          There are many kinds of redirection. One is the voluntary conversion of toll-access journals to OA. Conversion could be a journal’s grudging response to declining library budgets for toll-access journals and exclusion from the big deals that take the lion’s share of library budgets. It could be a grudging response to its own past price increases and rising levels of green OA (see chapter 8 on casualties). Or it could be a hopeful and enthusiastic desire to achieve the benefits of OA for authors (greater audience and impact), readers (freedom from price and permission barriers), and publishers themselves (increased readership, citations, submissions, and quality).
Another kind of redirection is the rise of OA journal funds at universities. Even during times of declining budgets, libraries are setting aside money to pay publication fees at fee-based OA journals. The funds help faculty choose OA journals for their new work and help build a sustainable alternative to toll-access journals.
Redirection is also taking place on a large scale, primarily through CERN’s SCOAP3 project (Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics). SCOAP3 is an ambitious plan to convert all the major toll-access journals in particle physics to OA, redirect the money formerly spent on reader-side subscription fees to author-side publication fees, and reduce the overall price to the journal-supporting institutions. It’s a peaceful revolution based on negotiation, consent, and self-interest. After four years of patiently building up budget pledges from libraries around the world, SCOAP3 entered its implementation phase in in April 2011.
If SCOAP3 succeeds, it won’t merely prove that CERN can pull off ambitious projects, which we already knew. It will prove that this particular ambitious project has an underlying win-win logic convincing to stakeholders. Some of the factors explaining the success of SCOAP3 to date are physics-specific, such as the small number of targeted journals, the green OA culture in physics embraced even by toll-access publishers, and the dominance of CERN. Other factors are not physics-specific, such as the evident benefits for research institutions, libraries, funders, and publishers. A success in particle physics would give hope that the model could be lifted and adapted to other fields without their own CERN-like institutions to pave the way. Other fields would not need CERN-like money or dominance so much as CERN-like convening power to bring the stakeholders to the table. Then the win-win logic would have a chance to take over from there.
Mark Rowse, former CEO of Ingenta, sketched another strategy for large-scale redirection in December 2003. A publisher could “flip” its toll-access journals to OA at one stroke by reinterpreting the payments it receives from university libraries as publication fees for a group of authors rather than subscription fees for a group of readers. One advantage over SCOAP3 is that the Rowsean flip can be tried one journal or one publisher at a time, and doesn’t require discipline-wide coordination. It could also scale up to the largest publishers or the largest coalitions of publishers.
We have to be imaginative but we don’t have to improvise. There are some principles we can try to follow. Money freed up by the cancellation or conversion of peer-reviewed TA journals should be spent first on peer-reviewed OA journals, to ensure the continuation of peer review. Large-scale redirection is more efficient than small-scale redirection. Peaceful revolution through negotiation and self-interest is more amicable and potentially more productive than adaptation forced by falling asteroids.
For the record, I advocate redirecting money freed up by cancellations or conversions, not canceling journals in order to free up money (except with SCOAP3 or Rowse-like consent and negotiation). This may look like hair-splitting, but the difference is neither small nor subtle. It’s roughly the difference between having great expectations and planning to kill your parents.

 AND THE STARS
BY JOHN A. SENTRY
When
you've had your ears pinned
 back in a bowknot, it's sometimes hard
 to remember that an intelligent people
 has no respect for a whipped enemy
 ... but does for a fairly beaten enemy.
Illustrated by van Dongen
Know
 him? Yes, I know
 him—
knew
him. That
 was twenty years ago.


 Everybody knows
 him now. Everybody
 who passed him on the street knows
 him. Everybody who went to the same
 schools, or even to different schools
 in different towns, knows him now.
 Ask them. But I knew him. I lived
 three feet away from him for a month
 and a half. I shipped with him and
 called him by his first name.


 What was he like? What was he
 thinking, sitting on the edge of his
 bunk with his jaw in his palm and
 his eyes on the stars? What did he
 think he was after?


 Well ... Well, I think he— You
 know, I think I never did know him,
 after all. Not well. Not as well as
 some of those people who're writing
 the books about him seem to.


 I couldn't really describe him to
 you. He had a duffelbag in his hand
 and a packed airsuit on his back. The
 skin of his face had been dried out
 by ship's air, burned by ultraviolet
 and broiled by infra red. The pupils
 of his eyes had little cloudy specks in
 them where the cosmic rays had shot
 through them. But his eyes were
 steady and his body was hard. What
 did he look like? He looked like a
 man.
It was after the war, and we were
 beaten. There used to be a school of
 thought among us that deplored our
 combativeness; before we had ever
 met any people from off Earth, even,
 you could hear people saying we
 were toughest, cruelest life-form in
 the Universe, unfit to mingle with
 the gentler wiser races in the stars,
 and a sure bet to steal their galaxy
 and corrupt it forever. Where
 these people got their information, I
 don't know.


 We were beaten. We moved out
 beyond Centaurus, and Sirius, and
 then we met the Jeks, the Nosurwey,
 the Lud. We tried Terrestrial know-how,
 we tried Production Miracles,
 we tried patriotism, we tried damning
 the torpedoes and full speed
 ahead ... and we were smashed back
 like mayflies in the wind. We died in
 droves, and we retreated from the
 guttering fires of a dozen planets, we
 dug in, we fought through the last
 ditch, and we were dying on Earth
 itself before Baker mutinied, shot
 Cope, and surrendered the remainder
 of the human race to the wiser, gentler
 races in the stars. That way, we
 lived. That way, we were permitted
 to carry on our little concerns, and
 mind our manners. The Jeks and the
 Lud and the Nosurwey returned to
 their own affairs, and we knew they
 would leave us alone so long as we
 didn't bother them.


 We liked it that way. Understand
 me—we didn't accept it, we didn't
 knuckle under with waiting murder
 in our hearts—we
liked
it. We were
 grateful just to be left alone again.
 We were happy we hadn't been
 wiped out like the upstarts the rest
 of the Universe thought us to be.
 When they let us keep our own solar
 system and carry on a trickle of trade
 with the outside, we accepted it for
 the fantastically generous gift it was.
 Too many of our best men were dead
 for us to have any remaining claim
 on these things in our own right. I
 know how it was. I was there, twenty
 years ago. I was a little, pudgy
 man with short breath and a high-pitched
 voice. I was a typical Earthman.
We were out on a God-forsaken
 landing field on Mars, MacReidie
 and I, loading cargo aboard the
Serenus
. MacReidie was First Officer.
 I was Second. The stranger came
 walking up to us.


 ""Got a job?"" he asked, looking at
 MacReidie.


 Mac looked him over. He saw the
 same things I'd seen. He shook his
 head. ""Not for you. The only thing
 we're short on is stokers.""


 You wouldn't know. There's no
 such thing as a stoker any more, with
 automatic ships. But the stranger
 knew what Mac meant.
Serenus
had what they called an
 electronic drive. She had to run with
 an evacuated engine room. The leaking
 electricity would have broken any
 stray air down to ozone, which eats
 metal and rots lungs. So the engine
 room had the air pumped out of her,
 and the stokers who tended the dials
 and set the cathode attitudes had to
 wear suits, smelling themselves for
 twelve hours at a time and standing
 a good chance of cooking where they
 sat when the drive arced.
Serenus
was
 an ugly old tub. At that, we were the
 better of the two interstellar freighters
 the human race had left.


 ""You're bound over the border,
 aren't you?""


 MacReidie nodded. ""That's right.
 But—""


 ""I'll stoke.""


 MacReidie looked over toward me
 and frowned. I shrugged my shoulders
 helplessly. I was a little afraid
 of the stranger, too.


 The trouble was the look of him.
 It was the look you saw in the bars
 back on Earth, where the veterans of
 the war sat and stared down into
 their glasses, waiting for night to
 fall so they could go out into the
 alleys and have drunken fights among
 themselves. But he had brought that
 look to Mars, to the landing field,
 and out here there was something
 disquieting about it.


 He'd caught Mac's look and turned
 his head to me. ""I'll stoke,"" he repeated.


 I didn't know what to say. MacReidie
 and I—almost all of the men
 in the Merchant Marine—hadn't
 served in the combat arms. We had
 freighted supplies, and we had seen
 ships dying on the runs—we'd had
 our own brushes with commerce raiders,
 and we'd known enough men
 who joined the combat forces. But
 very few of the men came back, and
 the war this man had fought hadn't
 been the same as ours. He'd commanded
 a fighting ship, somewhere,
 and come to grips with things we
 simply didn't know about. The mark
 was on him, but not on us. I couldn't
 meet his eyes. ""O.K. by me,"" I mumbled
 at last.


 I saw MacReidie's mouth turn
 down at the corners. But he couldn't
 gainsay the man any more than I
 could. MacReidie wasn't a mumbling
 man, so he said angrily: ""O.K.,
 bucko, you'll stoke. Go and sign on.""


 ""Thanks."" The stranger walked
 quietly away. He wrapped a hand
 around the cable on a cargo hook and
 rode into the hold on top of some
 freight. Mac spat on the ground and
 went back to supervising his end of
 the loading. I was busy with mine,
 and it wasn't until we'd gotten the
Serenus
loaded and buttoned up that
 Mac and I even spoke to each other
 again. Then we talked about the trip.
 We didn't talk about the stranger.
Daniels, the Third, had signed him
 on and had moved him into the empty
 bunk above mine. We slept all in
 a bunch on the
Serenus
—officers and
 crew. Even so, we had to sleep in
 shifts, with the ship's designers giving
 ninety per cent of her space to
 cargo, and eight per cent to power
 and control. That left very little for
 the people, who were crammed in
 any way they could be. I said empty
 bunk. What I meant was, empty during
 my sleep shift. That meant he
 and I'd be sharing work shifts—me
 up in the control blister, parked in
 a soft chair, and him down in the
 engine room, broiling in a suit for
 twelve hours.


 But I ate with him, used the head
 with him; you can call that rubbing
 elbows with greatness, if you want to.


 He was a very quiet man. Quiet in
 the way he moved and talked. When
 we were both climbing into our
 bunks, that first night, I introduced
 myself and he introduced himself.
 Then he heaved himself into his
 bunk, rolled over on his side, fixed
 his straps, and fell asleep. He was
 always friendly toward me, but he
 must have been very tired that first
 night. I often wondered what kind
 of a life he'd lived after the war—what
 he'd done that made him different
 from the men who simply
 grew older in the bars. I wonder,
 now, if he really did do anything
 different. In an odd way, I like to
 think that one day, in a bar, on a
 day that seemed like all the rest to
 him when it began, he suddenly looked
 up with some new thought, put
 down his glass, and walked straight
 to the Earth-Mars shuttle field.


 He might have come from any
 town on Earth. Don't believe the historians
 too much. Don't pay too much
 attention to the Chamber of Commerce
 plaques. When a man's name
 becomes public property, strange
 things happen to the facts.
It was MacReidie who first found
 out what he'd done during the war.


 I've got to explain about MacReidie.
 He takes his opinions fast
 and strong. He's a good man—is, or
 was; I haven't seen him for a long
 while—but he liked things simple.


 MacReidie said the duffelbag broke
 loose and floated into the middle of
 the bunkroom during acceleration.
 He opened it to see whose it was.
 When he found out, he closed it up
 and strapped it back in its place at
 the foot of the stoker's bunk.


 MacReidie was my relief on the
 bridge. When he came up, he didn't
 relieve me right away. He stood next
 to my chair and looked out through
 the ports.


 ""Captain leave any special instructions
 in the Order Book?"" he asked.


 ""Just the usual. Keep a tight watch
 and proceed cautiously.""


 ""That new stoker,"" Mac said.


 ""Yeah?""


 ""I knew there was something
 wrong with him. He's got an old
 Marine uniform in his duffel.""


 I didn't say anything. Mac glanced
 over at me. ""Well?""


 ""I don't know."" I didn't.


 I couldn't say I was surprised. It
 had to be something like that, about
 the stoker. The mark was on him, as
 I've said.


 It was the Marines that did Earth's
 best dying. It had to be. They were
 trained to be the best we had, and
 they believed in their training. They
 were the ones who slashed back the
 deepest when the other side hit us.
 They were the ones who sallied out
 into the doomed spaces between the
 stars and took the war to the other
 side as well as any human force could
 ever hope to. They were always the
 last to leave an abandoned position.
 If Earth had been giving medals to
 members of her forces in the war,
 every man in the Corps would have
 had the Medal of Honor two and
 three times over. Posthumously. I
 don't believe there were ten of them
 left alive when Cope was shot. Cope
 was one of them. They were a kind
 of human being neither MacReidie
 nor I could hope to understand.


 ""You don't know,"" Mac said. ""It's
 there. In his duffel. Damn it, we're
 going out to trade with his sworn
 enemies! Why do you suppose he
 wanted to sign on? Why do you suppose
 he's so eager to go!""


 ""You think he's going to try to
 start something?""


 ""Think! That's exactly what he's
 going for. One last big alley fight.
 One last brawl. When they cut him
 down—do you suppose they'll stop
 with him? They'll kill us, and then
 they'll go in and stamp Earth flat!
 You know it as well as I do.""


 ""I don't know, Mac,"" I said. ""Go
 easy."" I could feel the knots in my
 stomach. I didn't want any trouble.
 Not from the stoker, not from Mac.
 None of us wanted trouble—not
 even Mac, but he'd cause it to get
 rid of it, if you follow what I mean
 about his kind of man.


 Mac hit the viewport with his fist.
 ""Easy! Easy—nothing's easy. I hate
 this life,"" he said in a murderous
 voice. ""I don't know why I keep
 signing on. Mars to Centaurus and
 back, back and forth, in an old rust
 tub that's going to blow herself up
 one of these—""
Daniels called me on the phone
 from Communications. ""Turn up
 your Intercom volume,"" he said.
 ""The stoker's jamming the circuit.""


 I kicked the selector switch over,
 and this is what I got:


 ""
—so there we were at a million
 per, and the air was gettin' thick. The
 Skipper says 'Cheer up, brave boys,
 we'll—'
""


 He was singing. He had a terrible
 voice, but he could carry a tune, and
 he was hammering it out at the top
 of his lungs.


 ""
Twas the last cruise of the
Venus,
by God you should of seen us! The
 pipes were full of whisky, and just
 to make things risky, the jets
 were ...
""


 The crew were chuckling into their
 own chest phones. I could hear Daniels
 trying to cut him off. But he
 kept going. I started laughing myself.
 No one's supposed to jam an
 intercom, but it made the crew feel
 good. When the crew feels good, the
 ship runs right, and it had been a
 long time since they'd been happy.


 He went on for another twenty
 minutes. Then his voice thinned out,
 and I heard him cough a little.
 ""Daniels,"" he said, ""get a relief
 down here for me.
Jump to it!
"" He
 said the last part in a Master's voice.
 Daniels didn't ask questions. He sent
 a man on his way down.


 He'd been singing, the stoker had.
 He'd been singing while he worked
 with one arm dead, one sleeve ripped
 open and badly patched because the
 fabric was slippery with blood.
 There'd been a flashover in the drivers.
 By the time his relief got down
 there, he had the insulation back on,
 and the drive was purring along the
 way it should have been. It hadn't
 even missed a beat.


 He went down to sick bay, got the
 arm wrapped, and would have gone
 back on shift if Daniels'd let him.


 Those of us who were going off
 shift found him toying with the
 theremin in the mess compartment.
 He didn't know how to play it, and
 it sounded like a dog howling.


 ""Sing, will you!"" somebody yelled.
 He grinned and went back to the
 ""Good Ship
Venus
."" It wasn't good,
 but it was loud. From that, we went
 to ""Starways, Farways, and Barways,""
 and ""The Freefall Song."" Somebody
 started ""I Left Her Behind For You,""
 and that got us off into sentimental
 things, the way these sessions would
 sometimes wind up when spacemen
 were far from home. But not since
 the war, we all seemed to realize together.
 We stopped, and looked at
 each other, and we all began drifting
 out of the mess compartment.


 And maybe it got to him, too. It
 may explain something. He and I
 were the last to leave. We went to
 the bunkroom, and he stopped in the
 middle of taking off his shirt. He
 stood there, looking out the porthole,
 and forgot I was there. I heard him
 reciting something, softly, under his
 breath, and I stepped a little closer.
 This is what it was:

""
The rockets rise against the skies,
Slowly; in sunlight gleaming
With silver hue upon the blue.
And the universe waits, dreaming.
""
For men must go where the flame-winds blow,
The gas clouds softly plaiting;
Where stars are spun and worlds begun,
And men will find them waiting.
""
The song that roars where the rocket soars
Is the song of the stellar flame;
The dreams of Man and galactic span
Are equal and much the same.
""
 

 What was he thinking of? Make
 your own choice. I think I came close
 to knowing him, at that moment, but
 until human beings turn telepath, no
 man can be sure of another.


 He shook himself like a dog out
 of cold water, and got into his bunk.
 I got into mine, and after a while
 I fell asleep.
I don't know what MacReidie may
 have told the skipper about the stoker,
 or if he tried to tell him anything.
 The captain was the senior ticket
 holder in the Merchant Service, and
 a good man, in his day. He kept
 mostly to his cabin. And there was
 nothing MacReidie could do on his
 own authority—nothing simple, that
 is. And the stoker had saved the
 ship, and ...


 I think what kept anything from
 happening between MacReidie and
 the stoker, or anyone else and the
 stoker, was that it would have meant
 trouble in the ship. Trouble, confined
 to our little percentage of the ship's
 volume, could seem like something
 much more important than the fate
 of the human race. It may not seem
 that way to you. But as long as no
 one began anything, we could all get
 along. We could have a good trip.


 MacReidie worried, I'm sure. I
 worried, sometimes. But nothing
 happened.


 When we reached Alpha Centaurus,
 and set down at the trading field
 on the second planet, it was the same
 as the other trips we'd made, and the
 same kind of landfall. The Lud factor
 came out of his post after we'd
 waited for a while, and gave us our
 permit to disembark. There was a Jek
 ship at the other end of the field,
 loaded with the cargo we would get
 in exchange for our holdful of
 goods. We had the usual things;
 wine, music tapes, furs, and the like.
 The Jeks had been giving us light
 machinery lately—probably we'd get
 two or three more loads, and then
 they'd begin giving us something
 else.


 But I found that this trip wasn't
 quite the same. I found myself looking
 at the factor's post, and I realized
 for the first time that the Lud hadn't
 built it. It was a leftover from the
 old colonial human government. And
 the city on the horizon—men had
 built it; the touch of our architecture
 was on every building. I wondered
 why it had never occurred to me that
 this was so. It made the landfall different
 from all the others, somehow.
 It gave a new face to the entire
 planet.
Mac and I and some of the other
 crewmen went down on the field to
 handle the unloading. Jeks on self-propelled
 cargo lifts jockeyed among
 us, scooping up the loads as we unhooked
 the slings, bringing cases of
 machinery from their own ship. They
 sat atop their vehicles, lean and
 aloof, dashing in, whirling, shooting
 across the field to their ship and
 back like wild horsemen on the plains
 of Earth, paying us no notice.


 We were almost through when
 Mac suddenly grabbed my arm.
 ""Look!""


 The stoker was coming down on
 one of the cargo slings. He stood
 upright, his booted feet planted wide,
 one arm curled up over his head and
 around the hoist cable. He was in his
 dusty brown Marine uniform, the
 scarlet collar tabs bright as blood at
 his throat, his major's insignia glittering
 at his shoulders, the battle
 stripes on his sleeves.


 The Jeks stopped their lifts. They
 knew that uniform. They sat up in
 their saddles and watched him come
 down. When the sling touched the
 ground, he jumped off quietly and
 walked toward the nearest Jek. They
 all followed him with their eyes.


 ""We've got to stop him,"" Mac
 said, and both of us started toward
 him. His hands were both in plain
 sight, one holding his duffelbag,
 which was swelled out with the bulk
 of his airsuit. He wasn't carrying a
 weapon of any kind. He was walking
 casually, taking his time.


 Mac and I had almost reached him
 when a Jek with insignia on his
 coveralls suddenly jumped down
 from his lift and came forward to
 meet him. It was an odd thing to
 see—the stoker, and the Jek, who
 did not stand as tall. MacReidie and
 I stepped back.


 The Jek was coal black, his scales
 glittering in the cold sunlight, his
 hatchet-face inscrutable. He stopped
 when the stoker was a few paces
 away. The stoker stopped, too. All
 the Jeks were watching him and paying
 no attention to anything else. The
 field might as well have been empty
 except for those two.


 ""They'll kill him. They'll kill him
 right now,"" MacReidie whispered.


 They ought to have. If I'd been
 a Jek, I would have thought that uniform
 was a death warrant. But the
 Jek spoke to him:


 ""Are you entitled to wear that?""


 ""I was at this planet in '39. I was
 closer to your home world the year
 before that,"" the stoker said. ""I was
 captain of a destroyer. If I'd had a
 cruiser's range, I would have reached
 it."" He looked at the Jek. ""Where
 were you?""


 ""I was here when you were.""


 ""I want to speak to your ship's
 captain.""


 ""All right. I'll drive you over.""


 The stoker nodded, and they walked
 over to his vehicle together. They
 drove away, toward the Jek ship.


 ""All right, let's get back to work,""
 another Jek said to MacReidie and
 myself, and we went back to unloading
 cargo.
The stoker came back to our ship
 that night, without his duffelbag. He
 found me and said:


 ""I'm signing off the ship. Going
 with the Jeks.""


 MacReidie was with me. He said
 loudly: ""What do you mean, you're
 going with the Jeks?""


 ""I signed on their ship,"" the stoker
 said. ""Stoking. They've got a micro-nuclear
 drive. It's been a while since
 I worked with one, but I think I'll
 make out all right, even with the
 screwball way they've got it set up.""


 ""Huh?""


 The stoker shrugged. ""Ships are
 ships, and physics is physics, no matter
 where you go. I'll make out.""


 ""What kind of a deal did you
 make with them? What do you think
 you're up to?""


 The stoker shook his head. ""No
 deal. I signed on as a crewman. I'll
 do a crewman's work for a crewman's
 wages. I thought I'd wander around a
 while. It ought to be interesting,"" he
 said.


 ""On a Jek ship.""


 ""Anybody's ship. When I get to
 their home world, I'll probably ship
 out with some people from farther
 on. Why not? It's honest work.""


 MacReidie had no answer to that.


 ""But—"" I said.


 ""What?"" He looked at me as if
 he couldn't understand what might
 be bothering me, but I think perhaps
 he could.


 ""Nothing,"" I said, and that was
 that, except MacReidie was always a
 sourer man from that time up to as
 long as I knew him afterwards. We
 took off in the morning. The stoker
 had already left on the Jek ship, and
 it turned out he'd trained an apprentice
 boy to take his place.
It was strange how things became
 different for us, little by little after
 that. It was never anything you could
 put your finger on, but the Jeks began
 taking more goods, and giving us
 things we needed when we told them
 we wanted them. After a while,
Serenus
was going a little deeper into
 Jek territory, and when she wore out,
 the two replacements let us trade with
 the Lud, too. Then it was the Nosurwey,
 and other people beyond them,
 and things just got better for us,
 somehow.


 We heard about our stoker, occasionally.
 He shipped with the Lud,
 and the Nosurwey, and some people
 beyond them, getting along, going to
 all kinds of places. Pay no attention
 to the precise red lines you see on the
 star maps; nobody knows exactly
 what path he wandered from people
 to people. Nobody could. He just
 kept signing on with whatever ship
 was going deeper into the galaxy,
 going farther and farther. He messed
 with green shipmates and blue ones.
 One and two and three heads, tails,
 six legs—after all, ships are ships
 and they've all got to have something
 to push them along. If a man knows
 his business, why not? A man can
 live on all kinds of food, if he wants
 to get used to it. And any nontoxic
 atmosphere will do, as long as there's
 enough oxygen in it.


 I don't know what he did, to make
 things so much better for us. I don't
 know if he did anything, but stoke
 their ships and, I suppose, fix them
 when they were in trouble. I wonder
 if he sang dirty songs in that bad
 voice of his, to people who couldn't
 possibly understand what the songs
 were about. All I know is, for some
 reason those people slowly began
 treating us with respect. We changed,
 too, I think—I'm not the same man
 I was ... I think—not altogether
 the same; I'm a captain now, with
 master's papers, and you won't find
 me in my cabin very often ... there's
 a kind of joy in standing on a bridge,
 looking out at the stars you're moving
 toward. I wonder if it mightn't
 have kept my old captain out of that
 place he died in, finally, if he'd tried
 it.


 So, I don't know. The older I get,
 the less I know. The thing people remember
 the stoker for—the thing
 that makes him famous, and, I think,
 annoys him—I'm fairly sure is only
 incidental to what he really did. If he
 did anything. If he meant to. I wish
 I could be sure of the exact answer
 he found in the bottom of that last
 glass at the bar before he worked his
 passage to Mars and the
Serenus
, and
 began it all.


 So, I can't say what he ought to be
 famous for. But I suppose it's enough
 to know for sure that he was the first
 living being ever to travel all the way
 around the galaxy.

Granthan's mission was the most vital of the war.

 It would mean instant victory—but for whom?
I


 In the dream I was swimming in a river of white fire and the dream went
 on and on. And then I was awake—and the fire was still there, fiercely
 burning at me.


 I tried to move to get away from the flames, and then the real pain
 hit me. I tried to go back to sleep and the relative comfort of the
 river of fire, but it was no go. For better or worse, I was alive and
 conscious.


 I opened my eyes and took a look around. I was on the floor next to
 an unpadded acceleration couch—the kind the Terrestrial Space Arm
 installs in seldom-used lifeboats. There were three more couches, but
 no one in them. I tried to sit up. It wasn't easy but, by applying a
 lot more will-power than should be required of a sick man, I made it.
 I took a look at my left arm. Baked. The hand was only medium rare,
 but the forearm was black, with deep red showing at the bottom of the
 cracks where the crisped upper layers had burst....


 There was a first-aid cabinet across the compartment from me. I
 tried my right leg, felt broken bone-ends grate with a sensation
 that transcended pain. I heaved with the other leg, scrabbled with
 the charred arm. The crawl to the cabinet dwarfed Hillary's trek
 up Everest, but I reached it after a couple of years, and found the
 microswitch on the floor that activated the thing, and then I was
 fading out again....
I came out of it clear-headed but weak. My right leg was numb, but
 reasonably comfortable, clamped tight in a walking brace. I put up
 a hand and felt a shaved skull, with sutures. It must have been a
 fracture. The left arm—well, it was still there, wrapped to the
 shoulder and held out stiffly by a power truss that would keep the scar
 tissue from pulling up and crippling me. The steady pressure as the
 truss contracted wasn't anything to do a sense-tape on for replaying at
 leisure moments, but at least the cabinet hadn't amputated. I wasn't
 complaining.


 As far as I knew, I was the first recorded survivor of contact with the
 Gool—if I survived.


 I was still a long way from home, and I hadn't yet checked on the
 condition of the lifeboat. I glanced toward the entry port. It was
 dogged shut. I could see black marks where my burned hand had been at
 work.


 I fumbled my way into a couch and tried to think. In my condition—with
 a broken leg and third-degree burns, plus a fractured skull—I
 shouldn't have been able to fall out of bed, much less make the trip
 from
Belshazzar's
CCC to the boat; and how had I managed to dog that
 port shut? In an emergency a man was capable of great exertions. But
 running on a broken femur, handling heavy levers with charred fingers
 and thinking with a cracked head were overdoing it. Still, I was
 here—and it was time to get a call through to TSA headquarters.


 I flipped the switch and gave the emergency call-letters Col. Ausar
 Kayle of Aerospace Intelligence had assigned to me a few weeks before.
 It was almost five minutes before the ""acknowledge"" came through from
 the Ganymede relay station, another ten minutes before Kayle's face
 swam into view. Even through the blur of the screen I could see the
 haggard look.


 ""Granthan!"" he burst out. ""Where are the others? What happened out
 there?"" I turned him down to a mutter.


 ""Hold on,"" I said. ""I'll tell you. Recorders going?"" I didn't wait for
 an answer—not with a fifteen-minute transmission lag. I plowed on:


 ""
Belshazzar
was sabotaged. So was
Gilgamesh
—I think. I got out. I
 lost a little skin, but the aid cabinet has the case in hand. Tell the
 Med people the drinks are on me.""


 I finished talking and flopped back, waiting for Kayle's reply. On the
 screen, his flickering image gazed back impatiently, looking as hostile
 as a swing-shift ward nurse. It would be half an hour before I would
 get his reaction to my report. I dozed off—and awoke with a start.
 Kayle was talking.


 ""—your report. I won't mince words. They're wondering at your role in
 the disaster. How does it happen that you alone survived?""


 ""How the hell do I know?"" I yelled—or croaked. But Kayle's voice was
 droning on:


 ""... you Psychodynamics people have been telling me the Gool may
 have some kind of long-range telehypnotic ability that might make it
 possible for them to subvert a loyal man without his knowledge. You've
 told me yourself that you blacked out during the attack—and came to on
 the lifeboat, with no recollection of how you got there.


 ""This is war, Granthan. War against a vicious enemy who strike without
 warning and without mercy. You were sent out to investigate the
 possibility of—what's that term you use?—hyper-cortical invasion. You
 know better than most the risk I'd be running if you were allowed to
 pass the patrol line.


 ""I'm sorry, Granthan. I can't let you land on Earth. I can't accept
 the risk.""


 ""What do I do now?"" I stormed. ""Go into orbit and eat pills and hope
 you think of something? I need a doctor!""


 Presently Kayle replied. ""Yes,"" he said. ""You'll have to enter a
 parking orbit. Perhaps there will be developments soon which will make
 it possible to ... ah ... restudy the situation."" He didn't meet my
 eye. I knew what he was thinking. He'd spare me the mental anguish of
 knowing what was coming. I couldn't really blame him; he was doing
 what he thought was the right thing. And I'd have to go along and
 pretend—right up until the warheads struck—that I didn't know I'd
 been condemned to death.
II


 I tried to gather my wits and think my way through the situation. I
 was alone and injured, aboard a lifeboat that would be the focus of a
 converging flight of missiles as soon as I approached within battery
 range of Earth. I had gotten clear of the Gool, but I wouldn't survive
 my next meeting with my own kind. They couldn't take the chance that I
 was acting under Gool orders.


 I wasn't, of course. I was still the same Peter Granthan,
 psychodynamicist, who had started out with Dayan's fleet six weeks
 earlier. The thoughts I was having weren't brilliant, but they were
 mine, all mine....


 But how could I be sure of that?


 Maybe there was something in Kayle's suspicion. If the Gool were as
 skillful as we thought, they would have left no overt indications of
 their tampering—not at a conscious level.


 But this was where psychodynamics training came in. I had been reacting
 like any scared casualty, aching to get home and lick his wounds. But I
 wasn't just any casualty. I had been trained in the subtleties of the
 mind—and I had been prepared for just such an attack.


 Now was the time to make use of that training. It had given me one
 resource. I could unlock the memories of my subconscious—and see again
 what had happened.


 I lay back, cleared my mind of extraneous thoughts, and concentrated on
 the trigger word that would key an auto-hypnotic sequence....


 Sense impressions faded. I was alone in the nebulous emptiness of a
 first-level trance. I keyed a second word, slipped below the misty
 surface into a dreamworld of vague phantasmagoric figures milling in
 their limbo of sub-conceptualization. I penetrated deeper, broke
 through into the vividly hallucinatory third level, where images of
 mirror-bright immediacy clamored for attention. And deeper....
The immense orderly confusion of the basic memory level lay before
 me. Abstracted from it, aloof and observant, the monitoring
 personality-fraction scanned the pattern, searching the polydimensional
 continuum for evidence of an alien intrusion.


 And found it.


 As the eye instantaneously detects a flicker of motion amid an infinity
 of static detail, so my inner eye perceived the subtle traces of the
 probing Gool mind, like a whispered touch deftly rearranging my buried
 motivations.


 I focused selectively, tuned to the recorded gestalt.


 ""
It is a contact, Effulgent One!
""


 ""
Softly, now! Nurture the spark well. It but trembles at the
 threshold....
""


 ""
It is elusive, Master! It wriggles like a gorm-worm in the eating
 trough!
""


 A part of my mind watched as the memory unreeled. I listened to the
 voices—yet not voices, merely the shape of concepts, indescribably
 intricate. I saw how the decoy pseudo-personality which I had
 concretized for the purpose in a hundred training sessions had fought
 against the intruding stimuli—then yielded under the relentless thrust
 of the alien probe. I watched as the Gool operator took over the motor
 centers, caused me to crawl through the choking smoke of the devastated
 control compartment toward the escape hatch. Fire leaped up, blocking
 the way. I went on, felt ghostly flames whipping at me—and then the
 hatch was open and I pulled myself through, forcing the broken leg.
 My blackened hand fumbled at the locking wheel. Then the blast as
 the lifeboat leaped clear of the disintegrating dreadnought—and the
 world-ending impact as I fell.


 At a level far below the conscious, the embattled pseudo-personality
 lashed out again—fighting the invader.


 ""
Almost it eluded me then, Effulgent Lord. Link with this lowly one!
""


 ""
Impossible! Do you forget all my teachings? Cling, though you expend
 the last filament of your life-force!
""


 Free from all distraction, at a level where comprehension and retention
 are instantaneous and total, my monitoring basic personality fraction
 followed the skillful Gool mind as it engraved its commands deep in
 my subconscious. Then the touch withdrew, erasing the scars of its
 passage, to leave me unaware of its tampering—at a conscious level.


 Watching the Gool mind, I learned.


 The insinuating probe—a concept regarding which psychodynamicists had
 theorized—was no more than a pattern in emptiness....


 But a pattern which I could duplicate, now that I had seen what had
 been done to me.


 Hesitantly, I felt for the immaterial fabric of the continuum, warping
 and manipulating it, copying the Gool probe. Like planes of paper-thin
 crystal, the polyfinite aspects of reality shifted into focus, aligning
 themselves.


 Abruptly, a channel lay open. As easily as I would stretch out my hand
 to pluck a moth from a night-flower, I reached across the unimaginable
 void—and sensed a pit blacker than the bottom floor of hell, and a
 glistening dark shape.


 There was a soundless shriek. ""
Effulgence! It reached out—touched
 me!
""
Using the technique I had grasped from the Gool itself, I struck,
 stifling the outcry, invaded the fetid blackness and grappled the
 obscene gelatinous immensity of the Gool spy as it spasmed in a frenzy
 of xenophobia—a ton of liver writhing at the bottom of a dark well.


 I clamped down control. The Gool mind folded in on itself, gibbering.
 Not pausing to rest, I followed up, probed along my channel of contact,
 tracing patterns, scanning the flaccid Gool mind....


 I saw a world of yellow seas lapping at endless shores of mud. There
 was a fuming pit, where liquid sulphur bubbled up from some inner
 source, filling an immense natural basin. The Gool clustered at its
 rim, feeding, each monstrous shape heaving against its neighbors for a
 more favorable position.
I probed farther, saw the great cables of living nervous tissue that
 linked each eating organ with the brain-mass far underground. I traced
 the passages through which tendrils ran out to immense caverns where
 smaller creatures labored over strange devices. These, my host's memory
 told me, were the young of the Gool. Here they built the fleets that
 would transport the spawn to the new worlds the Prime Overlord had
 discovered, worlds where food was free for the taking. Not sulphur
 alone, but potassium, calcium, iron and all the metals—riches
 beyond belief in endless profusion. No longer would the Gool tribe
 cluster—those who remained of a once-great race—at a single feeding
 trough. They would spread out across a galaxy—and beyond.


 But not if I could help it.


 The Gool had evolved a plan—but they'd had a stroke of bad luck.


 In the past, they had managed to control a man here and there, among
 the fleets, far from home, but only at a superficial level. Enough,
 perhaps, to wreck a ship, but not the complete control needed to send a
 man back to Earth under Gool compulsion, to carry out complex sabotage.


 Then they had found me, alone, a sole survivor, free from the clutter
 of the other mind-fields. It had been their misfortune to pick a
 psychodynamicist. Instead of gaining a patient slave, they had opened
 the fortress door to an unseen spy. Now that I was there, I would see
 what I could steal.


 A timeless time passed. I wandered among patterns of white light and
 white sound, plumbed the deepest recesses of hidden Gool thoughts,
 fared along strange ways examining the shapes and colors of the
 concepts of an alien mind.


 I paused at last, scanning a multi-ordinal structure of pattern within
 pattern; the diagrammed circuits of a strange machine.


 I followed through its logic-sequence; and, like a bomb-burst, its
 meaning exploded in my mind.


 From the vile nest deep under the dark surface of the Gool world in
 its lonely trans-Plutonian orbit, I had plucked the ultimate secret of
 their kind.


 Matter across space.
""You've got to listen to me, Kayle,"" I shouted. ""I know you think I'm
 a Gool robot. But what I have is too big to let you blow it up without
 a fight. Matter transmission! You know what that can mean to us. The
 concept is too complex to try to describe in words. You'll have to take
 my word for it. I can build it, though, using standard components, plus
 an infinite-area antenna and a moebius-wound coil—and a few other
 things....""


 I harangued Kayle for a while, and then sweated out his answer. I was
 getting close now. If he couldn't see the beauty of my proposal, my
 screens would start to register the radiation of warheads any time now.


 Kayle came back—and his answer boiled down to ""no.""


 I tried to reason with him. I reminded him how I had readied myself
 for the trip with sessions on the encephaloscope, setting up the
 cross-networks of conditioned defensive responses, the shunt circuits
 to the decoy pseudo-personality, leaving my volitional ego free. I
 talked about subliminal hypnotics and the resilience quotient of the
 ego-complex.


 I might have saved my breath.


 ""I don't understand that psychodynamics jargon, Granthan,"" he snapped.
 ""It smacks of mysticism. But I understand what the Gool have done to
 you well enough. I'm sorry.""


 I leaned back and chewed the inside of my lip and thought unkind
 thoughts about Colonel Ausar Kayle. Then I settled down to solve the
 problem at hand.


 I keyed the chart file, flashed pages from the standard index on the
 reference screen, checking radar coverages, beacon ranges, monitor
 stations, controller fields. It looked as though a radar-negative boat
 the size of mine might possibly get through the defensive net with a
 daring pilot, and as a condemned spy, I could afford to be daring.


 And I had a few ideas.
III


 The shrilling of the proximity alarm blasted through the silence. For a
 wild moment I thought Kayle had beaten me to the punch; then I realized
 it was the routine DEW line patrol contact.


 ""Z four-oh-two, I am reading your IFF. Decelerate at 1.8 gee
 preparatory to picking up approach orbit....""


 The screen went on droning out instructions. I fed them into the
 autopilot, at the same time running over my approach plan. The scout
 was moving in closer. I licked dry lips. It was time to try.


 I closed my eyes, reached out—as the Gool mind had reached out to
 me—and felt the touch of a Signals Officer's mind, forty thousand
 miles distant, aboard the patrol vessel. There was a brief flurry of
 struggle; then I dictated my instructions. The Signals Officer punched
 keys, spoke into his microphone:


 ""As you were, Z four-oh-two. Continue on present course. At Oh-nineteen
 seconds, pick up planetary for re-entry and let-down.""


 I blanked out the man's recollection of what had happened, caught his
 belated puzzlement as I broke contact. But I was clear of the DEW line
 now, rapidly approaching atmosphere.


 ""Z four-oh-two,"" the speaker crackled. ""This is planetary control. I am
 picking you up on channel forty-three, for re-entry and let-down.""


 There was a long pause. Then:


 ""Z four-oh-two, countermand DEW Line clearance! Repeat, clearance
 countermanded! Emergency course change to standard hyperbolic code
 ninety-eight. Do not attempt re-entry. Repeat: do not attempt re-entry!""


 It hadn't taken Kayle long to see that I'd gotten past the outer line
 of defense. A few more minutes' grace would have helped. I'd play it
 dumb, and hope for a little luck.


 ""Planetary, Z four-oh-two here. Say, I'm afraid I missed part of that,
 fellows. I'm a little banged up—I guess I switched frequencies on you.
 What was that after 'pick up channel forty-three'...?""


 ""Four-oh-two, sheer off there! You're not cleared for re-entry!""


 ""Hey, you birds are mixed up,"" I protested. ""I'm cleared all the way. I
 checked in with DEW—""


 It was time to disappear. I blanked off all transmission, hit the
 controls, following my evasive pattern. And again I reached out—


 A radar man at a site in the Pacific, fifteen thousand miles away, rose
 from his chair, crossed the darkened room and threw a switch. The radar
 screens blanked off....


 For an hour I rode the long orbit down, fending off attack after
 attack. Then I was clear, skimming the surface of the ocean a few miles
 southeast of Key West. The boat hit hard. I felt the floor rise up,
 over, buffeting me against the restraining harness.


 I hauled at the release lever, felt a long moment of giddy
 disorientation as the escape capsule separated from the sinking
 lifeboat deep under the surface. Then my escape capsule was bobbing on
 the water.


 I would have to risk calling Kayle now—but by voluntarily giving my
 position away, I should convince him I was still on our side—and I was
 badly in need of a pick-up. I flipped the sending key.


 ""This is Z four-oh-two,"" I said. ""I have an urgent report for Colonel
 Kayle of Aerospace Intelligence.""


 Kayle's face appeared. ""Don't fight it, Granthan,"" he croaked. ""You
 penetrated the planetary defenses—God knows how. I—""


 ""Later,"" I snapped. ""How about calling off your dogs now? And send
 somebody out here to pick me up, before I add sea-sickness to my other
 complaints.""


 ""We have you pinpointed,"" Kayle cut in. ""It's no use fighting it,
 Granthan.""
I felt cold sweat pop out on my forehead. ""You've got to listen,
 Kayle,"" I shouted. ""I suppose you've got missiles on the way already.
 Call them back! I have information that can win the war—""


 ""I'm sorry, Granthan,"" Kayle said. ""It's too late—even if I could
 take the chance you were right.""


 A different face appeared on the screen.


 ""Mr. Granthan, I am General Titus. On behalf of your country, and
 in the name of the President—who has been apprised of this tragic
 situation—it is my privilege to inform you that you will be awarded
 the Congressional Medal of Honor—posthumously—for your heroic effort.
 Although you failed, and have in fact been forced, against your will,
 to carry out the schemes of the inhuman enemy, this in no way detracts
 from your gallant attempt. Mr. Granthan, I salute you.""


 The general's arm went up in a rigid gesture.


 ""Stow that, you pompous idiot!"" I barked. ""I'm no spy!""


 Kayle was back, blanking out the startled face of the general.


 ""Goodbye, Granthan. Try to understand....""


 I flipped the switch, sat gripping the couch, my stomach rising with
 each heave of the floating escape capsule. I had perhaps five minutes.
 The missiles would be from Canaveral.


 I closed my eyes, forced myself to relax, reached out....


 I sensed the distant shore, the hot buzz of human minds at work in the
 cities. I followed the coastline, found the Missile Base, flicked
 through the cluster of minds.


 ""—
missile on course; do right, baby. That's it, right in the slot.
""


 I fingered my way through the man's mind and found the control centers.
 He turned stiffly from the plotting board, tottered to a panel to slam
 his hand against the destruct button.


 Men fell on him, dragged him back. ""—
fool, why did you blow it?
""


 I dropped the contact, found another, who leaped to the panel,
 detonated the remainder of the flight of six missiles. Then I withdrew.
 I would have a few minutes' stay of execution now.


 I was ten miles from shore. The capsule had its own power plant. I
 started it up, switched on the external viewer. I saw dark sea, the
 glint of star-light on the choppy surface, in the distance a glow on
 the horizon that would be Key West. I plugged the course into the
 pilot, then leaned back and felt outward with my mind for the next
 attacker.
IV


 It was dark in the trainyard. I moved along the tracks in a stumbling
 walk. Just a few more minutes, I was telling myself.
A few more
 minutes and you can lie down ... rest....
The shadowed bulk of a box car loomed up, its open door a blacker
 square. I leaned against the sill, breathing hard, then reached inside
 for a grip with my good hand.


 Gravel scrunched nearby. The beam of a flashlight lanced out, slipped
 along the weathered car, caught me. There was a startled exclamation.
 I ducked back, closed my eyes, felt out for his mind. There was a
 confused murmur of thought, a random intrusion of impressions from the
 city all around. It was hard, too hard. I had to sleep—


 I heard the snick of a revolver being cocked, and dropped flat as a
 gout of flame stabbed toward me, the imperative Bam! echoing between
 the cars. I caught the clear thought:


 ""God-awful looking, shaved head, arm stuck out; him all right—""


 I reached out to his mind and struck at random. The light fell, went
 out, and I heard the unconscious body slam to the ground like a poled
 steer.


 It was easy—if I could only stay awake.


 I gritted my teeth, pulled myself into the car, crawled to a dark
 corner behind a crate and slumped down. I tried to evoke a personality
 fraction to set as a guard, a part of my mind to stay awake and warn
 me of danger. It was too much trouble. I relaxed and let it all slide
 down into darkness.
The car swayed, click-clack, click-clack. I opened my eyes, saw yellow
 sunlight in a bar across the litter on the floor. The power truss
 creaked, pulling at my arm. My broken leg was throbbing its indignation
 at the treatment it had received—walking brace and all—and the burned
 arm was yelling aloud for more of that nice dope that had been keeping
 it from realizing how bad it was. All things considered, I felt like a
 badly embalmed mummy—except that I was hungry. I had been a fool not
 to fill my pockets when I left the escape capsule in the shallows off
 Key Largo, but things had been happening too fast.


 I had barely made it to the fishing boat, whose owner I had coerced
 into rendezvousing with me before shells started dropping around us. If
 the gunners on the cruiser ten miles away had had any luck, they would
 have finished me—and the hapless fisherman—right then. We rode out a
 couple of near misses, before I put the cruiser's gunnery crew off the
 air.


 At a fishing camp on the beach, I found a car—with driver. He dropped
 me at the railyard, and drove off under the impression he was in town
 for groceries. He'd never believe he'd seen me.


 Now I'd had my sleep. I had to start getting ready for the next act of
 the farce.


 I pressed the release on the power truss, gingerly unclamped it, then
 rigged a sling from a strip of shirt tail. I tied the arm to my side as
 inconspicuously as possible. I didn't disturb the bandages.


 I needed new clothes—or at least different ones—and something to
 cover my shaved skull. I couldn't stay hidden forever. The yard cop had
 recognized me at a glance.


 I lay back, waiting for the train to slow for a town. I wasn't unduly
 worried—at the moment. The watchman probably hadn't convinced anyone
 he'd actually seen me. Maybe he hadn't been too sure himself.


 The click-clack slowed and the train shuddered to a stop. I crept to
 the door, peered through the crack. There were sunny fields, a few low
 buildings in the distance, the corner of a platform. I closed my eyes
 and let my awareness stretch out.


 ""—
lousy job. What's the use? Little witch in the lunch room ... up in
 the hills, squirrel hunting, bottle of whiskey....
""


 I settled into control gently, trying not to alarm the man. I saw
 through his eyes the dusty box car, the rust on the tracks, the
 listless weeds growing among cinders, and the weathered boards of
 the platform. I turned him, and saw the dingy glass of the telegraph
 window, a sagging screen door with a chipped enameled cola sign.


 I walked the man to the door, and through it. Behind a linoleum-topped
 counter, a coarse-skinned teen-age girl with heavy breasts and wet
 patches under her arms looked up without interest as the door banged.


 My host went on to the counter, gestured toward the waxed-paper-wrapped
 sandwiches under a glass cover. ""I'll take 'em all. And candy bars, and
 cigarettes. And give me a big glass of water.""


 ""Better git out there and look after yer train,"" the girl said
 carelessly. ""When'd you git so all-fired hungry all of a sudden?""


 ""Put it in a bag. Quick.""


 ""Look who's getting bossy—""


 My host rounded the counter, picked up a used paper bag, began stuffing
 food in it. The girl stared at him, then pushed him back. ""You git back
 around that counter!""


 She filled the bag, took a pencil from behind her ear.


 ""That'll be one eighty-five. Cash.""


 My host took two dog-eared bills from his shirt pocket, dropped them
 on the counter and waited while the girl filled a glass. He picked it
 up and started out.


 ""Hey! Where you goin' with my glass?""


 The trainman crossed the platform, headed for the boxcar. He slid the
 loose door back a few inches against the slack latch, pushed the bag
 inside, placed the glass of water beside it, then pulled off his grimy
 railroader's cap and pushed it through the opening. He turned. The girl
 watched from the platform. A rattle passed down the line and the train
 started up with a lurch. The man walked back toward the girl. I heard
 him say: ""Friend o' mine in there—just passin' through.""


 I was discovering that it wasn't necessary to hold tight control over
 every move of a subject. Once given the impulse to act, he would
 rationalize his behavior, fill in the details—and never know that the
 original idea hadn't been his own.


 I drank the water first, ate a sandwich, then lit a cigarette and lay
 back. So far so good. The crates in the car were marked ""U. S. Naval
 Aerospace Station, Bayou Le Cochon"". With any luck I'd reach New
 Orleans in another twelve hours. The first step of my plan included a
 raid on the Delta National Labs; but that was tomorrow. That could
 wait.
It was a little before dawn when I crawled out of the car at a siding
 in the swampy country a few miles out of New Orleans. I wasn't feeling
 good, but I had a stake in staying on my feet. I still had a few miles
 in me. I had my supplies—a few candy bars and some cigarettes—stuffed
 in the pockets of the tattered issue coverall. Otherwise, I was
 unencumbered. Unless you wanted to count the walking brace on my right
 leg and the sling binding my arm.


 I picked my way across mushy ground to a pot-holed black-top road,
 started limping toward a few car lights visible half a mile away. It
 was already hot. The swamp air was like warmed-over subway fumes.
 Through the drugs, I could feel my pulse throbbing in my various
 wounds. I reached out and touched the driver's mind; he was thinking
 about shrimps, a fish-hook wound on his left thumb and a girl with
 black hair. ""Want a lift?"" he called.


 I thanked him and got in. He gave me a glance and I pinched off his
 budding twinge of curiosity. It was almost an effort now not to follow
 his thoughts. It was as though my mind, having learned the trick of
 communications with others, instinctively reached out toward them.


 An hour later he dropped me on a street corner in a shabby marketing
 district of the city and drove off. I hoped he made out all right with
 the dark-haired girl. I spotted a used-clothing store and headed for it.


 Twenty minutes later I was back on the sidewalk, dressed in a
 pinkish-gray suit that had been cut a long time ago by a Latin
 tailor—maybe to settle a grudge. The shirt that went with it was
 an unsuccessful violet. The black string tie lent a dubious air of
 distinction. I'd swapped the railroader's cap for a tarnished beret.
 The man who had supplied the outfit was still asleep. I figured
 I'd done him a favor by taking it. I couldn't hope to pass for a
 fisherman—I wasn't the type. Maybe I'd get by as a coffee-house
 derelict.


 I walked past fly-covered fish stalls, racks of faded garments, grimy
 vegetables in bins, enough paint-flaked wrought iron to cage a herd of
 brontosauri, and fetched up at a cab stand. I picked a fat driver with
 a wart.


 ""How much to the Delta National Laboratories?""


 He rolled an eye toward me, shifted his toothpick.


 ""What ya wanna go out there for? Nothing out there.""


 ""I'm a tourist,"" I said. ""They told me before I left home not to miss
 it.""


 He grunted, reached back and opened the door. I got in. He flipped his
 flag down, started up with a clash of gears and pulled out without
 looking.


 ""How far is it?"" I asked him.


 ""It ain't far. Mile, mile and a quarter.""


 ""Pretty big place, I guess.""


 He didn't answer.


 We went through a warehousing district, swung left along the
 waterfront, bumped over railroad tracks, and pulled up at a nine-foot
 cyclone fence with a locked gate.


 ""A buck ten,"" my driver said.


 I looked out at the fence, a barren field, a distant group of low
 buildings. ""What's this?""


 ""This is the place you ast for. That'll be a buck ten, mister.""


 I touched his mind, planted a couple of false impressions and withdrew.
 He blinked, then started up, drove around the field, pulled up at an
 open gate with a blue-uniformed guard. He looked back at me.


 ""You want I should drive in, sir?""


 ""I'll get out here.""


 He jumped out, opened my door, helped me out with a hand under my good
 elbow. ""I'll get your change, sir,"" he said, reaching for his hip.


 ""Keep it.""


 ""Thank YOU."" He hesitated. ""Maybe I oughta stick around. You know.""


 ""I'll be all right.""


 ""I hope so,"" he said. ""A man like you—you and me—"" he winked. ""After
 all, we ain't both wearing berets fer nothing.""


 ""True,"" I said. ""Consider your tip doubled. Now drive away into the
 sunrise and forget you ever saw me.""

In March 2015, it was time for Hayden Wood and Amit Gudka to move out of the kitchen. The pair had raised investment for their startup, Bulb, a renewable energy supplier, and they were looking for an office.  

 A coworking space was the obvious choice: somewhere that would allow them to take on more desks as needed. (When I meet them a little over a year later, they were eight strong and hiring around one more each month.) ""We looked at a few different spaces,"" says Wood, who had previously spent 10 years in management consultancy for Monitor Group (now Monitor Deloitte) and Bain &amp; Company. ""Second Home had been open a few months and we took the tour. We were nervous: were we going to get in?"" 

 It is odd, perhaps, to think of the renting of office space as a socially testing business, entailing pre-interview nerves. But acceptance into Second Home, for some, signifies hipness. Juliette Morgan, partner at Cushman &amp; Wakefield, a property consultancy, who works out of Second Home, says: ""I used to joke that there was a cool alarm that went off when people came to look round – but then they let us in."" 

 Morgan's case may have been helped by her previous role as head of property for Tech City, the government initiative promoted by David Cameron's advisor Rohan Silva, who also happens to be the co-founder of Second Home. Wood admits that he and Gudka, who previously traded energy at Barclays for eight years, did know some people at Second Home already. ""When we looked on the website, some of the faces were familiar. And we hoped our business idea was quite good.""
When I arrive at the Second Home reception desk, a sign urges me to ""join us tonight at 3.30pm for meditation."" Before that, there's the option to have lunch at the atrium restaurant, Jago, founded by a former head chef of Ottolenghi and the former general manager of Morito. Today, there are cauliflower fritters made with lentil flour (gluten-free), which you can eat while admiring the exuberant architecture of Spanish firm SelgasCano, which has transformed the former carpet warehouse near Brick Lane: a plexiglass bubble punched out of the front of the building, sweeping curved walls, a wide cantilevered staircase up to the pod-like offices on the first floor.
The benches are orange, the floors yellow. (""There is quite a lot of science behind the colours, to do with improving mood and productivity,"" says Morgan.) Flowers flop in elegant vases and masses of plants sit in pots on sills, desks and walls. A row of fruit trees is in blossom outside. The exposed concrete pillars look unfinished, with scribble and tags still visible. Sam Aldenton, Silva's co-founder, has sourced 600 mid-century modern chairs from all over Europe.
""It's an aesthetic that tells an investor you're being frugal with their money,"" says Morgan, ""but it's also playful and energetic and that works for your brand. For us, it tells the tech companies we want to work with that we understand them. Coworking spaces say something about you, that you're a Second Home business or a Central Working business."" 

 Being a Second Home business gives you access to others that have also made the grade. ""We had a strong business plan, but there were other things we didn't have,""says Wood. ""Someone at Second Home recommended our branding agency, Ragged Edge. Congregation Partners, who are here, have helped with recruiting; and we met Blue State Digital [a digital strategy agency that worked on Obama's election campaign, whose London office is based at Second Home] in the bar one Friday night and they offered us a workshop about how to market and launch. It's an extremely generous collaborative culture.""
Other kinds of business at Second Home include venture capitalists; the European headquarters of chore-outsourcing company TaskRabbit; and ASAP54, an app that scans online fashion and locates where to buy it. Silva and Aldenton curate events that help them to network and that offer a kind of intellectual support and ballast – so Amit Gudka, a fan of the South African theoretical physicist Neil Turok was able to hear him speak at Second Home and afterwards have dinner with him and Silva. 

 Wood and Gudka's first post-kitchen office was in Second Home's roaming area, where freelancers come and go. A desk costs £350 a month; they are sold several times over (a four-to-one ratio is thought to ensure the right level of occupancy without straining supply). The pair subsequently moved into a studio, then a larger office; they will take a bigger space upstairs when the refurbishment of three upper floors is completed. ""It doesn't feel like being a tenant,"" says Wood. ""The community team here has taught us a lot about how to interact with our own members."" 

 We are all members now, it seems. Business ventures are turning themselves into clubs, making what used to be banal choices about office space or energy supply statements of identity. There was no shortage of office options for Wood and Gudka, and all of them carried connotations about what kind of business they meant to be: incubators and accelerators run by different sorts of organisations; hacker spaces; industry- and sector-coworking spaces; more traditional office rentals from companies like Regus and Workspace; and all manner of coworking spaces, from scruffy coops to coworking empires.  

 Coworking began because startups and freelancers, typically in tech and the creative industries, needed somewhere to work. But as more organisations outsource more of their operations – or as large corporates seek to reach those startups – the range of activities represented among coworkers has expanded to comprehend almost everything. KPMG’s tech startup advice arm is based at Interchange in Camden. Merck, Microsoft, American Express and GE all lease desks at WeWork, in addition to running their own offices. 

 The annual Global Coworking Survey, produced by Deskmag, anticipates that 10,000 new coworking spaces will open worldwide in 2016. In Europe, the estimated number of spaces (though it's hard to keep track) has risen from 3,400 in 2013 to around 7,800 in 2016. According to Cushman &amp; Wakefield's Juliette Morgan, ""Twelve per cent of the uptake in the London market in the last year has been spaces like this. Everyone thinks it's going to continue.""
At a purely economic level, it's easy to see why. As large corporates downsize their core operations, they no longer need vast offices. Iris Lapinski watched the process in action when her educational non-profit startup, Apps for Good, squatted in Royal Bank of Scotland’s offices in the City in late 2008. ""RBS was going through huge waves of redundancies. On our floor, it was three of us and 150 empty desks,"" she says, ""and then new people would come in and they'd get fired too. Eventually they'd fired so many people they closed down the building."" Aware that ""tech companies were doing something funkier"", she moved Apps for Good into the Trampery, the first coworking space in Shoreditch. 

 Adam Neumann and Miguel McKelvey founded WeWork in 2010 in New York to capitalise on this corporate downsizing phenomenon: leasing large spaces, often previous corporate offices, subdividing them, then selling them at a profit. WeWork typically rents its buildings (although it owns its latest London site in Paddington) then subleases the space – with, according to Fast Company, average gross margins of 60 per cent. 

 The model has proved so successful that WeWork now has 103 locations in 29 cities worldwide. The company will open five new coworking spaces in London this year, bringing the total to 11, with Paddington large enough for 2,100 'members'. The company recently authorised the sale of up to $780m in new stock, giving it a $16bn valuation and making it, on paper, the sixth most valuable private startup in the world. 

 The Freelancers' Union in the US claims that 30 per cent of the US working population is now freelance, and predicts a rise to 50 per cent by 2035. One in eight London workers are self-employed. But the unstoppable rise and rise of coworking isn't simply about corporate downsizing and the growth of the startup and the gig economy, significant though these are. 

 What distinguishes contemporary coworking spaces is the nature of their cultural claims. A study by Harvard Business Review found that coworkers believe their work has more meaning. The authors suggested that working alongside people doing different things reinforces workers' identity and distinctiveness; that coworkers feel they have more control over their lives (many spaces are open 24/7); that they have a stronger sense of community; and that there is still a social mission inherent in the idea of coworking, as outlined in the Coworking manifesto, and reinforced by the annual Global Coworking UnConference or GCUC (pronounced 'juicy'). WeWork's website urges you to ""Create your life's work"".  

 ""Do what you love"" is one of WeWork's slogans, emblazoned on the front of a notebook they give me when I visit. Another is ""Thank God it's Monday"". Neumann describes his generation (he is 36) as the 'we generation' which, he explains, ""cares about the world, actually wants to do cool things, and loves working."" 

 The coworking space – even on a vast, industrial scale as at WeWork – is a club. And the whole point of clubs is that you want to belong to them. To someone raised in the era of the corporate office, used to the subversive feeling of being behind enemy lines, this may seem an odd way to think about the workplace. To anyone for whom The Office of Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant was painfully recognisable, with its grey partitions and random people thrown together to do pretty pointless things and get on each other's nerves, it might seem risible.  

 But clearly lots of people want this. A paradoxical effect of the internet has been to make us desire more social connection in the real world. From coffee shops to festivals to gyms, examples are everywhere of people keen to come together and share experiences. 

 As we have to rely more on ourselves and on our own resources at work, it's probably not surprising that we seek out the reassuring sight of other people doing the same. As Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri say in their 2012 book, Declaration, ""The centre of gravity of capitalist production no longer resides in the factory but has drifted outside its walls. Society has become a factory."" 

 Work has blurred into life, in part owing to the peculiar nature of our current relationship to technology. We do not conceive of machines, as we did in the past, as engines of oppression, exploiting workers; rather, we frame our devices as intimate and personal, interactive and fun, blurring the distinctions between work and play.  

 We tend not, for example, to view posting on Facebook as labour, even though there are perfectly good economic arguments why we should. The eight hours' work, eight hours' leisure, eight hours' rest fought for so fiercely in the 19th century has become meaningless in an era when we willingly, eagerly, spend 12 hours a day on a laptop.  

 As work becomes increasingly unpredictable and permeable, in a way that reflects the internet itself, workspaces are imagined more as social landscapes. Increasingly, they are designed for serendipitous encounters, emotional expression, explorations of identity. Of course, you could take the cynical view that the imperative of productivity has now colonised every aspect of our lives, that our private relationships have become 'social capital', that even our intimate interactions have been turned into a kind of labour. Or you could say, as coworking enthusiasts tend to, that work has got a whole lot more fun. 

 Whatever, this shift in our sense of work helps to explain why workplaces have increasingly come to resemble clubs, and why no one is falling about laughing at the idea of Silva and Aldenton calling their workspace Second Home. The workspace has become an expression of identity – which raises two questions:  first, if coworking is all about finding a space to express your individualism, follow your passions, explore your creativity, why do the spaces all look so alike? And second, if the workplace is all about belonging to a club and clubs are by their nature exclusive, how scalable is that?
There are new buildings rising all around WeWork Moorgate, in the City of London; an insistent noise of drilling, a clang of girders, a rumble of concrete mixers. This is some of the most expensive real estate in the world. Crossrail's engineers are tunnelling beneath; giant new buildings advertise themselves on construction hoardings everywhere at street level: there is a provisional air, as though the city can't quite catch up with its own wealth.
WeWork Moorgate is the second largest coworking space in the UK after WeWork Paddington, accommodating 3,000 people over eight floors. A permanent desk will cost you £425 a month, rising to £675 depending on its location in the building. A one-person office will set you back £725 to £825 a month, a four-person £2,600 to £3,100. The largest office here is for 40 people; in Paddington, one company has 230 desks. 

 The interior ticks all the coworking style boxes: raw concrete; exposed ceilings revealing air conditioning ducts, pipes and silvered insulation; multicoloured upholstery; a kitchen with its own island bar offering free tea, coffee and craft beer; easy chairs and sofas; tables of varying heights and sizes; music; and some signifiers of fun, such as a table tennis table (but, unlike at WeWork's South Bank site, no arcade machines; nor, unlike at its Devonshire Square, any skateboards on the walls). 

 In the toilet, cups for mouthwash urge you to 'stay fresh', which I am sure is meant jocularly but which arouses in me the same sort of mulish resentment I used to feel when I worked in advertising in my twenties and slogans in reception ordered me to ""reach for the stars"". (What makes you think I wouldn't, mate?). 

 Given that coworking, which after all grew out of hacker culture, is supposed to embody an attitude of resistance to conventional authority, WeWork is curiously corporate, certainly in its approach to communication. I am asked not to quote the community manager who shows me around. There isn't anyone who can speak on the record (or off it, for that matter) in the building. My queries have to be submitted in writing then edited down because there are too many of them. The answers come back, finally, appended: ""All attributable to Eugen Miropolski, Managing Director, Europe"". 

 Eugen Miropolski, Managing Director, Europe, says that WeWork is ""much more than an office space provider. Members are given the space, community and services they need to create their life's work"". Going around the building, what you mainly notice is that the spaces allotted to people's life's work are rather tiny and cramped. Effectively off corridors, they seem rather conventional behind their glass partitions: a desk, a chair, a lamp, a drawer. Many coworkers sit with their backs to their colleagues, staring at blank walls, with barely enough space for a third person to pass between them. You need a keycard to get anywhere inside the building.  

 WeWork's enthusiasts, though, emphasise the connections they make with others, either physically or through an app that links members to 50,000 others worldwide. Miropolski claims ""more than 70 per cent of our members collaborate with each other"".  

 This empire of office space has been derided as 'McCoworking'; but another way of looking at it might simply be that it's a sign of natural segmentation as the market matures. Many workspace providers set up because they wanted some office space themselves; they have no desire to be other than local, small-scale and collaborative. But others are starting to take on a role as akind of corporate parent. Canada's Coworking Ontario provides health insurance. WeWork is also reported to be looking at providing discounts on healthcare, payroll and shipping, replicating services that a corporate employer might once have provided. 

 Meanwhile, at the other end of the scale, coffee shop-workspace hybrid Timberyard is dematerialising the desk, providing mobile workers who need to sit down and check their emails with the most ad hoc of workspaces. Most of Timberyard's users don't pay for space, the usual coworking business model, but they do pay for the tea and coffee (""award-winning"", co-founder Darren Elliott is keen to point out) and for the artisan-produced, wellness-focused food (super seeds with almond butter on toast, beetroot, avocado and hummus on toast, hibiscus cake). Unlike most coffee shops, Timberyard's branches in Seven Dials and Soho are designed to encourage customers to stay and work: there is fast Wi-Fi with plentiful power sockets, careful regulation of temperature, lots of natural light and attentive design. Many of the chairs have been rescued from skips and reupholstered; the tables are striped like Jim Lambie staircases; the disabled toilet looks like a shipping container. 

 In the last couple of months, Timberyard has renting out permanent desks in the basement of its Soho branch and now hosts three companies, one of eight people, one of 12 and one of 20. But Elliott says the shop upstairs will always be open to the street and the public. Typically, workers stay for a couple of hours, but they might be there for 20 minutes or all day. ""We believe this is the way people will work in the future,"" Elliott says, surveying a sea of laptops: ""portable, connected, independent and collaborative, sharing resources and seeking out inspiring spaces."" Timberyard intends to become a way station for the digital nomad.
The logical extension of the elision of work and home life is that the same organisations might end up providing both. WeWork is experimenting with micro apartments in two locations: in New York and at Crystal City, outside Washington DC. Second Home is also believed to have Roam, which began in Bali, intends to build a global co-living network, with its offer: ""Sign one lease. Live around the world."" From its initial base in Ubud, it has expanded into Miami and recently Madrid; Buenos Aires and London are 'coming soon'. Roam isn't simply about a bed for the night: it sells itself partly on the quality of its coworking offer. In Bali, the office space is on the roof, under a palm thatch, with a swimming pool in the courtyard below.  

 Coworking organisations increasingly see a market in digital nomads: if you can work from a coffee shop in Seven Dials, why not a rooftop in Bali? It's not even necessary to have a string of spaces across the world to attract drop-ins from elsewhere:Coworking Visa andCoPass offer 'passports' that guarantee a certain amount of time in any of their participating spaces. 

 The Trampery, the pioneering coworking organisation in London that attracted Iris Lapinski, is now moving into co-living. Founded by the sociologist-entrepreneur-musician-traveller-dandy Charles Armstrong, The Trampery currently has three spaces, at Old Street, near City Hall, and in Hackney Wick. Armstrong began with a cross-sector workspace but now specialises in fashion and retail at Old St, travel and tourism at London Bridge, and digital artists, fashion and design in Hackney, finding this a better way to create 'intentional communities' and secure corporate partnerships.  

 In what Armstrong calls ""a somewhat unconventional deal with Peabody"", the Trampery is about to start building Fish Island Village in Hackney Wick: a co-living space that will also include traditional social housing. This experiment is partly a response to the pricing out of London of artists and other creatives and partly an attempt ""to move beyond a single workspace to think about a neighbourhood"". 

 When Fish Island Village is built, the Trampery will curate its inhabitants based on what Armstrong describes as a mix of ""means testing and merit testing"". Rather than the usual micro-apartment model, ""cellular units with a cavernous social area"", Fish Island Village will have communal spaces for up to six bedrooms, ""more like a large family. There will still be a members' club, shared by everyone."" The development won't be aimed solely at affluent 18- to 30-year-olds, but will include flats of up to four bedrooms, suitable for people with children. ""We don't want to create a single-generational demographic bubble.""
The single generation demographic bubble is of course the trouble with all this curation. Even while lip service is paid to ideas of innovation coming from unexpected places, from unlikely collisions and random connections, it is a very tough-minded curator who doesn't seek to be surrounded by people who are basically a bit like himself. With coworking spaces, as with the internet, there is the promise of connection and collaboration and a world of newness and surprise. And, as with the internet, there is a danger that you can easily end up talking either to people just like yourself. 

 So what of those questions about style and scalability? As far as the former is concerned, coworking spaces do all look a little bit alike – but design has a long history of innovators and followers. Inevitably, everyone borrows the more directional visual cues, even to the point of pastiche. 

 But they are not, in fact, all alike. They are surprising in their degree of difference. There are industrial-scale operators that lack the warmth and personal touches of the smaller providers (no one at WeWork is ever going to come out of the kitchen as you arrive, knowing your name and whom you're here to visit, which is what happens at the Trampery); but which also lack their preciousness about who is allowed to the party. And then there are the cool clubs that everyone in their right mind would want to join, but where few are chosen.  

 It seems likely that coworking spaces will follow a pattern set by festivals. They will proliferate, each developing its own distinctive vibe, projecting an array of differing identities while all answering a need for the increasingly autonomous workers of the future to hang out with other people.  

 Meanwhile, the current excitement over coworking may have less to do with a method of office organisation than with a handful of hugely successful connectors. When Iris Lapinski moved out of RBS, she chose the Trampery partly because ""Charles draws in interesting people. He's got links to corporates, government, policymakers."" One of these connections turned out to be Bob Schukai, head of advanced product innovation at Thomson Reuters, which led directly to £300,000 of sponsorship revenue for Apps for Good. ""Charles is a great connector,"" Lapinsky says, ""and that is really what makes the Trampery so special. Most don't have the same flair.""

He was dangerously insane. He threatened
 
to destroy everything that was noble and
 
decent—including my date with my girl!
When the elevator didn't come, that just made the day perfect. A broken
 egg yolk, a stuck zipper, a feedback in the aircon exhaust, the window
 sticking at full transparency—well, I won't go through the whole sorry
 list. Suffice it to say that when the elevator didn't come, that put
 the roof on the city, as they say.


 It was just one of those days. Everybody gets them. Days when you're
 lucky in you make it to nightfall with no bones broken.


 But of all times for it to happen! For literally months I'd been
 building my courage up. And finally, just today, I had made up my
 mind to do it—to propose to Linda. I'd called her second thing this
 morning—right after the egg yolk—and invited myself down to her
 place. ""Ten o'clock,"" she'd said, smiling sweetly at me out of the
 phone. She knew why I wanted to talk to her. And when Linda said ten
 o'clock, she meant ten o'clock.


 Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that Linda's a perfectionist or a
 harridan or anything like that. Far from it. But she does have a
 fixation on that one subject of punctuality. The result of her job,
 of course. She was an ore-sled dispatcher. Ore-sleds, being robots,
 were invariably punctual. If an ore-sled didn't return on time, no one
 waited for it. They simply knew that it had been captured by some other
 Project and had blown itself up.


 Well, of course, after working as an ore-sled dispatcher for three
 years, Linda quite naturally was a bit obsessed. I remember one time,
 shortly after we'd started dating, when I arrived at her place five
 minutes late and found her having hysterics. She thought I'd been
 killed. She couldn't visualize anything less than that keeping me from
 arriving at the designated moment. When I told her what actually had
 happened—I'd broken a shoe lace—she refused to speak to me for four
 days.


 And then the elevator didn't come.
Until then, I'd managed somehow to keep the day's minor disasters from
 ruining my mood. Even while eating that horrible egg—I couldn't very
 well throw it away, broken yolk or no; it was my breakfast allotment
 and I was hungry—and while hurriedly jury-rigging drapery across that
 gaspingly transparent window—one hundred and fifty-three stories
 straight down to slag—I kept going over and over my prepared proposal
 speeches, trying to select the most effective one.


 I had a Whimsical Approach: ""Honey, I see there's a nice little
 Non-P apartment available up on one seventy-three."" And I had a
 Romantic Approach: ""Darling, I can't live without you at the moment.
 Temporarily, I'm madly in love with you. I want to share my life
 with you for a while. Will you be provisionally mine?"" I even had a
 Straightforward Approach: ""Linda, I'm going to be needing a wife for at
 least a year or two, and I can't think of anyone I would rather spend
 that time with than you.""


 Actually, though I wouldn't even have admitted this to Linda, much less
 to anyone else, I loved her in more than a Non-P way. But even if we
 both had been genetically desirable (neither of us were) I knew that
 Linda relished her freedom and independence too much to ever contract
 for any kind of marriage other than Non-P—Non-Permanent, No Progeny.


 So I rehearsed my various approaches, realizing that when the time
 came I would probably be so tongue-tied I'd be capable of no more
 than a blurted, ""Will you marry me?"" and I struggled with zippers and
 malfunctioning air-cons, and I managed somehow to leave the apartment
 at five minutes to ten.


 Linda lived down on the hundred fortieth floor, thirteen stories away.
 It never took more than two or three minutes to get to her place, so I
 was giving myself plenty of time.


 But then the elevator didn't come.


 I pushed the button, waited, and nothing happened. I couldn't
 understand it.


 The elevator had always arrived before, within thirty seconds of
 the button being pushed. This was a local stop, with an elevator
 that traveled between the hundred thirty-third floor and the hundred
 sixty-seventh floor, where it was possible to make connections for
 either the next local or for the express. So it couldn't be more than
 twenty stories away. And this was a non-rush hour.


 I pushed the button again, and then I waited some more. I looked at my
 watch and it was three minutes to ten. Two minutes, and no elevator! If
 it didn't arrive this instant, this second, I would be late.


 It didn't arrive.


 I vacillated, not knowing what to do next. Stay, hoping the elevator
 would come after all? Or hurry back to the apartment and call Linda, to
 give her advance warning that I would be late?


 Ten more seconds, and still no elevator. I chose the second
 alternative, raced back down the hall, and thumbed my way into my
 apartment. I dialed Linda's number, and the screen lit up with white
 letters on black: PRIVACY DISCONNECTION.


 Of course! Linda expected me at any moment. And she knew what I wanted
 to say to her, so quite naturally she had disconnected the phone, to
 keep us from being interrupted.


 Frantic, I dashed from the apartment again, back down the hall to the
 elevator, and leaned on that blasted button with all my weight. Even if
 the elevator should arrive right now, I would still be almost a minute
 late.


 No matter. It didn't arrive.


 I would have been in a howling rage anyway, but this impossibility
 piled on top of all the other annoyances and breakdowns of the day
 was just too much. I went into a frenzy, and kicked the elevator door
 three times before I realized I was hurting myself more than I was
 hurting the door. I limped back to the apartment, fuming, slammed the
 door behind me, grabbed the phone book and looked up the number of
 the Transit Staff. I dialed, prepared to register a complaint so loud
 they'd be able to hear me in sub-basement three.


 I got some more letters that spelled: BUSY.
It took three tries before I got through to a hurried-looking female
 receptionist ""My name is Rice!"" I bellowed. ""Edmund Rice! I live on the
 hundred and fifty-third floor! I just rang for the elevator and——""


 ""The-elevator-is-disconnected."" She said it very rapidly, as though she
 were growing very used to saying it.


 It only stopped me for a second. ""Disconnected? What do you mean
 disconnected? Elevators don't
get
disconnected!"" I told her.


 ""We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible,"" she rattled. My bellowing
 was bouncing off her like radiation off the Project force-screen.


 I changed tactics. First I inhaled, making a production out of it,
 giving myself a chance to calm down a bit. And then I asked, as
 rationally as you could please, ""Would you mind terribly telling me
why
the elevator is disconnected?""


 ""I-am-sorry-sir-but-that——""


 ""Stop,"" I said. I said it quietly, too, but she stopped. I saw her
 looking at me. She hadn't done that before, she'd merely gazed blankly
 at her screen and parroted her responses.


 But now she was actually looking at
me
.


 I took advantage of the fact. Calmly, rationally, I said to her, ""I
 would like to tell you something, Miss. I would like to tell you just
 what you people have done to me by disconnecting the elevator. You have
 ruined my life.""


 She blinked, open-mouthed. ""Ruined your life?""


 ""Precisely."" I found it necessary to inhale again, even more slowly
 than before. ""I was on my way,"" I explained, ""to propose to a girl whom
 I dearly love. In every way but one, she is the perfect woman. Do you
 understand me?""


 She nodded, wide-eyed. I had stumbled on a romantic, though I was too
 preoccupied to notice it at the time.


 ""In every way but one,"" I continued. ""She has one small imperfection,
 a fixation about punctuality. And I was supposed to meet her at ten
 o'clock.
I'm late!
"" I shook my fist at the screen. ""Do you realize
 what you've
done
, disconnecting the elevator? Not only won't she
 marry me, she won't even
speak
to me! Not now! Not after this!""


 ""Sir,"" she said tremulously, ""please don't shout.""


 ""I'm not shouting!""


 ""Sir, I'm terribly sorry. I understand your—""


 ""You
understand
?"" I trembled with speechless fury.


 She looked all about her, and then leaned closer to the screen,
 revealing a cleavage that I was too distraught at the moment to pay
 any attention to. ""We're not supposed to give this information out,
 sir,"" she said, her voice low, ""but I'm going to tell you, so you'll
 understand why we had to do it. I think it's perfectly awful that it
 had to ruin things for you this way. But the fact of the matter is—""
 she leaned even closer to the screen—""there's a spy in the elevator.""
II


 It was my turn to be stunned.


 I just gaped at her. ""A—a what?""


 ""A spy. He was discovered on the hundred forty-seventh floor, and
 managed to get into the elevator before the Army could catch him. He
 jammed it between floors. But the Army is doing everything it can think
 of to get him out.""


 ""Well—but why should there be any problem about getting him out?""


 ""He plugged in the manual controls. We can't control the elevator from
 outside at all. And when anyone tries to get into the shaft, he aims
 the elevator at them.""


 That sounded impossible. ""He
aims
the elevator?""


 ""He runs it up and down the shaft,"" she explained, ""trying to crush
 anybody who goes after him.""


 ""Oh,"" I said. ""So it might take a while.""


 She leaned so close this time that even I, distracted as I was, could
 hardly help but take note of her cleavage. She whispered, ""They're
 afraid they'll have to starve him out.""


 ""Oh, no!""


 She nodded solemnly. ""I'm terribly sorry, sir,"" she said. Then she
 glanced to her right, suddenly straightened up again, and said,
 ""We-will-resume-service-as-soon-as-possible."" Click. Blank screen.


 For a minute or two, all I could do was sit and absorb what I'd been
 told. A spy in the elevator! A spy who had managed to work his way all
 the way up to the hundred forty-seventh floor before being unmasked!


 What in the world was the matter with the Army? If things were getting
 that lax, the Project was doomed, force-screen or no. Who knew how many
 more spies there were in the Project, still unsuspected?


 Until that moment, the state of siege in which we all lived had had
 no reality for me. The Project, after all, was self-sufficient and
 completely enclosed. No one ever left, no one ever entered. Under our
 roof, we were a nation, two hundred stories high. The ever-present
 threat of other projects had never been more for me—or for most other
 people either, I suspected—than occasional ore-sleds that didn't
 return, occasional spies shot down as they tried to sneak into the
 building, occasional spies of our own leaving the Project in tiny
 radiation-proof cars, hoping to get safely within another project and
 bring back news of any immediate threats and dangers that project might
 be planning for us. Most spies didn't return; most ore-sleds did. And
 within the Project life was full, the knowledge of external dangers
 merely lurking at the backs of our minds. After all, those external
 dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr.
 Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War.


 Dr. Kilbillie—Intermediate Project History, when I was fifteen years
 old—had private names for every major war of the twentieth century.
 There was the Ignoble Nobleman's War, the Racial Non-Racial War, and
 the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, known to the textbooks of course as
 World Wars One, Two, and Three.


 The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of
 many many factors, but two of the most important were the population
 explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The population explosion, of course,
 meant that there was continuously more and more people but never any
 more space. So that housing, in the historically short time of one
 century, made a complete transformation from horizontal expansion to
 vertical. Before 1900, the vast majority of human beings lived in
 tiny huts of from one to five stories. By 2000,
everybody
lived in
 Projects. From the very beginning, small attempts were made to make
 these Projects more than dwelling places. By mid-century, Projects
 (also called apartments and co-ops) already included restaurants,
 shopping centers, baby-sitting services, dry cleaners and a host of
 other adjuncts. By the end of the century, the Projects were completely
 self-sufficient, with food grown hydroponically in the sub-basements,
 separate floors set aside for schools and churches and factories, robot
 ore-sleds capable of seeking out raw materials unavailable within the
 Projects themselves and so on. And all because of, among other things,
 the population explosion.


 And the Treaty of Oslo.


 It seems there was a power-struggle between two sets of then-existing
 nations (they were something like Projects, only horizontal instead of
 vertical) and both sets were equipped with atomic weapons. The Treaty
 of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added
 that just in case anyone happened to think of it only
tactical
atomic
 weapons could be used. No
strategic
atomic weapons. (A tactical
 weapon is something you use on the soldiers, and a strategic weapons is
 something you use on the folks at home.) Oddly enough, when somebody
 did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which
 meant that no Projects were bombed.


 Of course, they made up for this as best they could by using tactical
 atomic weapons all over the place. After the war almost the whole
 world was quite dangerously radioactive. Except for the Projects. Or
 at least those of them which had in time installed the force screens
 which had been invented on the very eve of battle, and which deflected
 radioactive particles.


 However, what with all of the
other
treaties which were broken during
 the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War, by the time it was finished nobody
 was quite sure any more who was on whose side. That project over there
 on the horizon might be an ally. And then again it might not. Since
 they weren't sure either, it was risky to expose yourself in order to
 ask.


 And so life went on, with little to remind us of the dangers lurking
 Outside. The basic policy of Eternal Vigilance and Instant Preparedness
 was left to the Army. The rest of us simply lived our lives and let it
 go at that.
But now there was a spy in the elevator.


 When I thought of how deeply he had penetrated our defenses, and of how
 many others there might be, still penetrating, I shuddered. The walls
 were our safeguards only so long as all potential enemies were on the
 other side of them.


 I sat shaken, digesting this news, until suddenly I remembered Linda.


 I leaped to my feet, reading from my watch that it was now ten-fifteen.
 I dashed once more from the apartment and down the hall to the
 elevator, praying that the spy had been captured by now and that Linda
 would agree with me that a spy in the elevator was good and sufficient
 reason for me to be late.


 He was still there. At least, the elevator was still out.


 I sagged against the wall, thinking dismal thoughts. Then I noticed the
 door to the right of the elevator. Through that door was the stairway.


 I hadn't paid any attention to it before. No one ever uses the stairs
 except adventurous young boys playing cops and robbers, running up and
 down from landing to landing. I myself hadn't set foot on a flight of
 stairs since I was twelve years old.


 Actually, the whole idea of stairs was ridiculous. We had elevators,
 didn't we? Usually, I mean, when they didn't contain spies. So what was
 the use of stairs?


 Well, according to Dr. Kilbillie (a walking library of unnecessary
 information), the Project had been built when there still had been such
 things as municipal governments (something to do with cities, which
 were more or less grouped Projects), and the local municipal government
 had had on its books a fire ordinance, anachronistic even then, which
 required a complete set of stairs in every building constructed in the
 city. Ergo, the Project had stairs, thirty-two hundred of them.


 And now, after all these years, the stairs might prove useful after
 all. It was only thirteen flights to Linda's floor. At sixteen steps a
 flight, that meant two hundred and eight steps.


 Could I descend two hundred and eight steps for my true love? I could.
 If the door would open.


 It would, though reluctantly. Who knew how many years it had been since
 last this door had been opened? It squeaked and wailed and groaned and
 finally opened half way. I stepped through to the musty, dusty landing,
 took a deep breath, and started down. Eight steps and a landing, eight
 steps and a floor. Eight steps and a landing, eight steps and a floor.


 On the landing between one fifty and one forty-nine, there was a
 smallish door. I paused, looking curiously at it, and saw that at one
 time letters had been painted on it. The letters had long since flaked
 away, but they left a lighter residue of dust than that which covered
 the rest of the door. And so the words could still be read, if with
 difficulty.


 I read them. They said:
EMERGENCY ENTRANCE

 ELEVATOR SHAFT

 AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL

 ONLY

 KEEP LOCKED


 I frowned, wondering immediately why this door wasn't being firmly
 guarded by at least a platoon of Army men. Half a dozen possible
 answers flashed through my mind. The more recent maps might simply
 have omitted this discarded and unnecessary door. It might be sealed
 shut on the other side. The Army might have caught the spy already.
 Somebody in authority might simply have goofed.


 As I stood there, pondering these possibilities, the door opened and
 the spy came out, waving a gun.
III


 He couldn't have been anyone else but the spy. The gun, in the first
 place. The fact that he looked harried and upset and terribly nervous,
 in the second place. And, of course, the fact that he came from the
 elevator shaft.


 Looking back, I think he must have been just as startled as I when we
 came face to face like that. We formed a brief tableau, both of us
 open-mouthed and wide-eyed.


 Unfortunately, he recovered first.


 He closed the emergency door behind him, quickly but quietly. His gun
 stopped waving around and instead pointed directly at my middle. ""Don't
 move!"" he whispered harshly. ""Don't make a sound!""


 I did exactly as I was told. I didn't move and I didn't make a sound.
 Which left me quite free to study him.


 He was rather short, perhaps three inches shorter than me, with a bony
 high-cheekboned face featuring deepset eyes and a thin-lipped mouth. He
 wore gray slacks and shirt, with brown slippers on his feet. He looked
 exactly like a spy ... which is to say that he
didn't
look like a
 spy, he looked overpoweringly ordinary. More than anything else, he
 reminded me of a rather taciturn milkman who used to make deliveries to
 my parents' apartment.


 His gaze darted this way and that. Then he motioned with his free hand
 at the descending stairs and whispered, ""Where do they go?""


 I had to clear my throat before I could speak. ""All the way down,"" I
 said.


 ""Good,"" he said—just as we both heard a sudden raucous squealing from
 perhaps four flights down, a squealing which could be nothing but the
 opening of a hall door. It was followed by the heavy thud of ascending
 boots. The Army!


 But if I had any visions of imminent rescue, the spy dashed them. He
 said, ""Where do you live?""


 ""One fifty-three,"" I said. This was a desperate and dangerous man.
 I knew my only slim chance of safety lay in answering his questions
 promptly, cooperating with him until and unless I saw a chance to
 either escape or capture him.


 ""All right,"" he whispered. ""Go on."" He prodded me with the gun.


 And so we went back up the stairs to one fifty-three, and stopped at
 the door. He stood close behind me, the gun pressed against my back,
 and grated in my ear, ""I'll have this gun in my pocket. If you make one
 false move I'll kill you. Now, we're going to your apartment. We're
 friends, just strolling along together. You got that?""


 I nodded.


 ""All right. Let's go.""


 We went. I have never in my life seen that long hall quite so empty as
 it was right then. No one came out of any of the apartments, no one
 emerged from any of the branch halls. We walked to my apartment. I
 thumbed the door open and we went inside.


 Once the door was closed behind us, he visibly relaxed, sagging against
 the door, his gun hand hanging limp at his side, a nervous smile
 playing across his lips.


 I looked at him, judging the distance between us, wondering if I could
 leap at him before he could bring the gun up again. But he must have
 read my intentions on my face. He straightened, shaking his head. He
 said, ""Don't try it. I don't want to kill you. I don't want to kill
 anybody, but I will if I have to. We'll just wait here together until
 the hue and cry passes us. Then I'll tie you up, so you won't be able
 to sic your Army on me too soon, and I'll leave. If you don't try any
 silly heroics, nothing will happen to you.""


 ""You'll never get away,"" I told him. ""The whole Project is alerted.""


 ""You let me worry about that,"" he said. He licked his lips. ""You got
 any chico coffee?""


 ""Yes.""


 ""Make me a cup. And don't get any bright ideas about dousing me with
 boiling water.""


 ""I only have my day's allotment,"" I protested. ""Just enough for two
 cups, lunch and dinner.""


 ""Two cups is fine,"" he said. ""One for each of us.""
And now I had yet another grudge against this blasted spy. Which
 reminded me again of Linda. From the looks of things, I wasn't
ever
going to get to her place. By now she was probably in mourning for me
 and might even have the Sanitation Staff searching for my remains.


 As I made the chico, he asked me questions. My name first, and then,
 ""What do you do for a living?""


 I thought fast. ""I'm an ore-sled dispatcher,"" I said. That was a lie,
 of course, but I'd heard enough about ore-sled dispatching from Linda
 to be able to maintain the fiction should he question me further about
 it.


 Actually, I was a gymnast instructor. The subjects I taught included
 wrestling, judo and karati—talents I would prefer to disclose to him
 in my own fashion, when the time came.


 He was quiet for a moment. ""What about radiation level on the
 ore-sleds?""


 I had no idea what he was talking about, and admitted as much.


 ""When they come back,"" he said. ""How much radiation do they pick up?
 Don't you people ever test them?""


 ""Of course not,"" I told him. I was on secure ground now, with Linda's
 information to guide me. ""All radiation is cleared from the sleds and
 their cargo before they're brought into the building.""


 ""I know that,"" he said impatiently. ""But don't you ever check them
 before de-radiating them?""
""No. Why should we?""


 ""To find out how far the radiation level outside has dropped.""


 ""For what? Who cares about that?""


 He frowned bitterly. ""The same answer,"" he muttered, more to himself
 than to me. ""The same answer every time. You people have crawled into
 your caves and you're ready to stay in them forever.""


 I looked around at my apartment. ""Rather a well-appointed cave,"" I told
 him.


 ""But a cave nevertheless."" He leaned toward me, his eyes gleaming with
 a fanatical flame. ""Don't you ever wish to get Outside?""


 Incredible! I nearly poured boiling water all over myself. ""Outside? Of
 course not!""


 ""The same thing,"" he grumbled, ""over and over again. Always the same
 stupidity. Listen, you! Do you realize how long it took man to get out
 of the caves? The long slow painful creep of progress, for millennia,
 before he ever made that first step from the cave?""


 ""I have no idea,"" I told him.


 ""I'll tell you this,"" he said belligerently. ""A lot longer than it
 took for him to turn around and go right back into the cave again."" He
 started pacing the floor, waving the gun around in an agitated fashion
 as he talked. ""Is this the
natural
life of man? It is not. Is this
 even a
desirable
life for man? It is
definitely
not."" He spun back
 to face me, pointing the gun at me again, but this time he pointed
 it as though it were a finger, not a gun. ""Listen, you,"" he snapped.
 ""Man was progressing. For all his stupidities and excesses, he was
 growing up. His dreams were getting bigger and grander and better all
 the time. He was planning to tackle
space
! The moon first, and then
 the planets, and finally the stars. The whole universe was out there,
 waiting to be plucked like an apple from a tank. And Man was reaching
 out for it."" He glared as though daring me to doubt it.
I decided that this man was doubly dangerous. Not only was he a spy,
 he was also a lunatic. So I had two reasons for humoring him. I nodded
 politely.


 ""So what happened?"" he demanded, and immediately answered himself.
 ""I'll tell you what happened! Just as he was about to make that first
 giant step, Man got a hotfoot. That's all it was, just a little
 hotfoot. So what did Man do? I'll tell you what he did. He turned
 around and he ran all the way back to the cave he started from, his
 tail between his legs.
That's
what he did!""


 To say that all of this was incomprehensible would be an extreme
 understatement. I fulfilled my obligation to this insane dialogue by
 saying, ""Here's your coffee.""


 ""Put it on the table,"" he said, switching instantly from raving maniac
 to watchful spy.


 I put it on the table. He drank deep, then carried the cup across the
 room and sat down in my favorite chair. He studied me narrowly, and
 suddenly said, ""What did they tell you I was? A spy?""


 ""Of course,"" I said.


 He grinned bitterly, with one side of his mouth. ""Of course. The damn
 fools! Spy! What do you suppose I'm going to spy on?""


 He asked the question so violently and urgently that I knew I had to
 answer quickly and well, or the maniac would return. ""I—I wouldn't
 know, exactly,"" I stammered. ""Military equipment, I suppose.""


 ""Military equipment?
What
military equipment? Your Army is supplied
 with uniforms, whistles and hand guns, and that's about it.""


 ""The defenses—"" I started.


 ""The defenses,"" he interrupted me, ""are non-existent. If you mean the
 rocket launchers on the roof, they're rusted through with age. And what
 other defenses are there? None.""


 ""If you say so,"" I replied stiffly. The Army claimed that we had
 adequate defense equipment. I chose to believe the Army over an enemy
 spy.


 ""Your people send out spies, too, don't they?"" he demanded.


 ""Well, of course.""


 ""And what are
they
supposed to spy on?""


 ""Well—"" It was such a pointless question, it seemed silly to even
 answer it. ""They're supposed to look for indications of an attack by
 one of the other projects.""


 ""And do they find any indications, ever?""


 ""I'm sure I don't know,"" I told him frostily. ""That would be classified
 information.""


 ""You bet it would,"" he said, with malicious glee. ""All right, if that's
 what
your
spies are doing, and if
I'm
a spy, then it follows that
 I'm doing the same thing, right?""


 ""I don't follow you,"" I admitted.


 ""If I'm a spy,"" he said impatiently, ""then I'm supposed to look for
 indications of an attack by you people on my Project.""


 I shrugged. ""If that's your job,"" I said, ""then that's your job.""


 He got suddenly red-faced, and jumped to his feet. ""That's
not
my
 job, you blatant idiot!"" he shouted. ""I'm not a spy! If I
were
a spy,
then
that would be my job!""
The maniac had returned, in full force. ""All right,"" I said hastily.
 ""All right, whatever you say.""


 He glowered at me a moment longer, then shouted, ""Bah!"" and dropped
 back into the chair.


 He breathed rather heavily for a while, glaring at the floor, then
 looked at me again. ""All right, listen. What if I were to tell you that
 I
had
found indications that you people were planning to attack my
 Project?""


 I stared at him. ""That's impossible!"" I cried. ""We aren't planning to
 attack anybody! We just want to be left in peace!""


 ""How do I know that?"" he demanded.


 ""It's the truth! What would we want to attack anybody for?""


 ""Ah hah!"" He sat forward, tensed, pointing the gun at me like a finger
 again. ""Now, then,"" he said. ""If you know it doesn't make any sense for
 this Project to attack any other project, then why in the world should
 you think
they
might see some advantage in attacking
you
?""


 I shook my head, dumbfounded. ""I can't answer a question like that,"" I
 said. ""How do I know what they're thinking?""


 ""They're human beings, aren't they?"" he cried. ""Like you? Like me? Like
 all the other people in this mausoleum?""


 ""Now, wait a minute—""


 ""No!"" he shouted. ""You wait a minute! I want to tell you something. You
 think I'm a spy. That blundering Army of yours thinks I'm a spy. That
 fathead who turned me in thinks I'm a spy. But I'm
not
a spy, and I'm
 going to tell you what I am.""


 I waited, looking as attentive as possible.


 ""I come,"" he said, ""from a Project about eighty miles north of here.
 I came here by foot, without any sort of radiation shield at all to
 protect me.""


 The maniac was back. I didn't say a word. I didn't want to set off the
 violence that was so obviously in this lunatic.


 ""The radiation level,"" he went on, ""is way down. It's practically as
 low as it was before the Atom War. I don't know how long it's been
 that low, but I would guess about ten years, at the very least."" He
 leaned forward again, urgent and serious. ""The world is safe out there
 now. Man can come back out of the cave again. He can start building
 the dreams again. And this time he can build better, because he has
 the horrible example of the recent past to guide him away from the
 pitfalls. There's no need any longer for the Projects.""


 And that was like saying there's no need any longer for stomachs, but I
 didn't say so. I didn't say anything at all.


 ""I'm a trained atomic engineer,"" he went on. ""In my project, I worked
 on the reactor. Theoretically, I believed that there was a chance the
 radiation Outside was lessening by now, though we had no idea exactly
 how much radiation had been released by the Atom War. But I wanted
 to test the theory, and the Commission wouldn't let me. They claimed
 public safety, but I knew better. If the Outside were safe and the
 Projects were no longer needed, then the Commission was out of a job,
 and they knew it.

By ROBERT J. SHEA
Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS
Blue Boy's rating was high and his fans were loyal to the
 death—anyone's death!
Gavir gingerly fitted the round opening in the bottom of the silvery
 globe over the top of his hairless blue skull. He pulled the globe
 down until he felt tiny filaments touching his scalp. The tips of the
 wires were cold.


 The moderator then said, ""
Dreaming Through the Universe
tonight
 brings you the first native Martian to appear on the dreamwaves—Gavir
 of the Desert Men. With him is his guardian, Dr. Malcomb Rice, the
 noted anthropologist.""


 Then the moderator questioned Malcomb, while Gavir nervously
 awaited the moment when his thoughts would be transmitted to millions
 of Earthmen. Malcomb told how he had been struck by Gavir's
 intelligence and missionary-taught ability to speak Earth's language,
 and had decided to bring Gavir to Earth.


 The moderator turned to Gavir. ""Are you anxious to get back to Mars?""
No!
Gavir thought. Back behind the Preserve Barrier that killed you
 instantly if you stepped too close to it? Back to the constant fear of
 being seized by MDC guards for a labor pool, to wind up in the MDC
 mines?


 Mars was where Gavir's father had been pinned, bayonets through his
 hands and feet, to the wall of a shack just the other side of the
 Barrier, to die slowly, out of Gavir's reach. Father James told Gavir
 that the head of MDC himself had ordered the killing, because Gavir's
 father had tried to organize resistance to the Corporation. Mars was
 where the magic powers of the Earthmen and the helplessness of the
 Martian tribes would always protect the head of MDC from Gavir's
 vengeance.


 Back to that world of hopeless fear and hatred?
I never want to go
 back to Mars! I want to stay here!
But that wasn't what he was supposed to think. Quickly he said, ""I
 will be happy to return to my people.""


 A movement caught his eye. The producer, reclining on a divan in a far
 corner of the small studio, was making some kind of signal by beating
 his fist against his forehead.


 ""Well, enough of that!"" the moderator said briskly. ""How about singing
 one of your tribal songs for us?""


 Gavir said, ""I will sing the
Song of Going to Hunt
."" He heaved
 himself up from the divan, and, feet planted wide apart, threw back
 his head and began to howl.


 He was considered a poor singer in his tribe, and he was not surprised
 that Malcomb and the moderator winced. But Malcomb had told him that
 it wouldn't matter. The dreamees receiving the dreamcast would hear
 the song as it
should
sound, as Gavir heard it in his mind.
 Everything that Gavir saw and heard and felt in his mind, the dreamees
 could see and hear and feel....




 I
 t was cold, bitter cold, on the plain. The hunter stood at the edge
 of the camp as the shriveled Martian sun struck the tops of the Shakam
 hills. The hunter hefted the long, balanced narvoon, the throwing
 knife, in his hand. He had faith in the knife, and in his skill with
 it.


 The hunter filled his lungs, the cold air reaching deep into his
 chest. He shouted out his throat-bursting hunting cry. He began to run
 across the plain.


 Crouching behind crumbling red rocks, racing over flat expanses of
 orange sand, the hunter sought traces of the seegee, the great slow
 desert beast whose body provided his tribe with all the essentials of
 existence. At last he saw tracks. He mounted a dune. Out on the plain
 before him a great brown seegee lumbered patiently, unaware of its
 danger.


 The hunter was about to strike out after it, when a dark form leaped
 at him.


 The hunter saw it out of the corner of his eye at the last moment. His
 startled sidestep saved him from the neck-breaking snap of the great
 jaws.


 The drock's long body was armored with black scales. Curving fangs
 protruded from its upper jaw. Its hand-like forepaws ended in hooked
 claws, to grasp and tear its prey. It was larger, stronger, faster
 than the hunter. The thin Martian air carried weirdly high-pitched
 cries which proclaimed its craving to sink its fangs into the hunter's
 body. The drock's huge hind legs coiled back on their triple joints,
 and it sprang.


 The hunter thrust the gleaming knife out before him, so that the dark
 body would land on its gleaming blade. The drock twisted in mid-air
 and landed to one side of the hunter.


 Now, before it could gather itself for another spring, there was time
 for one cast of the blade. It had to be done at once. It had to be
 perfect. If it failed, the knife would be lost and the drock would
 have its kill. The hunter grasped the weapon by the blade, drew his
 arm back, and snapped it forward.


 The blade struck deep into the throat of the drock.


 The drock screamed eerily and jumped clumsily. The hunter threw
 himself at the great, dark body and retrieved the knife. He struck
 with it again and again into the gray twitching belly. Colorless blood
 ran out over the hard, tightly-stretched skin.


 The drock fell, gave a last convulsion, and lay still. The hunter
 plunged the blade into the red sand to clean it. He threw back his
 head and bellowed his hunting cry. There was great glory in killing
 the drock, for it showed that the Desert Man and not the drock, was
 lord of the red waste....
Gavir sat down on the divan, exhausted, his song finished. He didn't
 hear the moderator winding up the dreamcast. Then the producer of the
 program was upon him.


 He began shouting even before Gavir removed his headset. ""What kind
 of a fool are you? Before you started that song, you dreamed things
 about the Martian Development Corporation that were libelous! I got
 the whole thing—the Barrier, the guards, the labor pools and mines,
 the father crucified. It was awful! MDC is one of our biggest
 sponsors.""


 Malcomb said, ""You can't expect an untrained young Martian to control
 his very thoughts. And may I point out that your tone is hostile?""


 At this a sudden change came over the producer. The standard Earth
 expression—invincible benignity—took control of his face. ""I
 apologize for having spoken sharply, but dreamcasting is a
 nerve-wracking business. If it weren't for Ethical Conditioning, I
 don't know how I'd control my aggressive impulses. The Suppression of
 Aggression is the Foundation of Civilization, eh?""


 Malcomb smiled. ""Ethical Conditioning Keeps Society from Fissioning.""
 He shook hands with the producer.


 ""Come around tomorrow at 1300 and collect your fee,"" said the
 producer. ""Good night, gentlemen.""


 As they left the Global Dreamcasting System building, Gavir said to
 Malcomb, ""Can we go to a bookstore tonight?""


 ""Tomorrow. I'm taking you to your hotel and then I'm going back to my
 apartment. We both need sleep. And don't forget, you've been warned
 not to go prowling around the city by yourself....""


 As soon as Gavir was sure that Malcomb was out of the hotel and well
 on his way home, he left his room and went out into the city.


 In a pitifully few days he would be back in the Preserve, back with
 the fear of MDC, with hunger and the hopeless desire to find and kill
 the man who had ordered his father's death.


 Now he had an opportunity to learn more about the universe of the
 Earthmen. Despite Malcomb's orders, he was going to find a seller of
 books.


 During a reading class at the mission school, Father James had said,
 ""In books there is power. All that you call magic in our Earth
 civilization is explained in books."" Gavir wanted to learn. It was his
 only hope to find an alternative to the short, fear-ridden,
 impoverished life he foresaw for himself.


 A river of force carried him, along with thousands of
 Earthmen—godlike beings in their perfect health and their impregnable
 benignity—through the streets of the city. Platforms of force raised
 and lowered him through the city's multiple levels....


 And, as has always happened to outlanders in cities, he became lost.
He was in a quarter where furtive red and violet lights danced in the
 shadows of hunched buildings. A half-dozen Earthmen approached him,
 stopped and stared. Gavir stared back.


 The Earthmen wore black garments and furs and metal ornaments. The
 biggest of them wore a black suit, a long black cape, and a
 broad-brimmed black hat. He carried a coiled whip in one hand. The
 Earthmen turned to one another.


 ""A Martian.""


 ""Let's give pain and death to the Martian! It will be a new
 experience—one to savor.""


 ""Take pain, Martian!""


 The Earthman with the black hat raised his arm, and the long heavy
 lash fell on Gavir. He felt a savage sting in the arm he had thrown up
 to protect his eyes.


 Gavir leaped at the Earthmen. He clubbed the man with the whip across
 the face. As the others rushed in, Gavir flailed about him with long
 arms and heavy fists.


 He began to enjoy it. It was rare that a Martian had an opportunity to
 knock Earthmen down. The mood of the
Song of Going to Hunt
came over
 him. He sprang free of his attackers and drew his glittering narvoon.


 The man with the whip yelled. They looked at his knife, and then all
 at once turned and ran. Gavir drew back his arm and threw the knife
 with a practiced catapult-snap of shoulder, elbow, and wrist. To his
 surprise, the blade clattered to the street far short of his
 retreating enemies. Then he remembered: you couldn't throw far in the
 gravity of Earth.


 The Earthmen disappeared into a lift-force field. Gavir decided not to
 pursue them. He walked forward and picked up his narvoon, and saw that
 the street on which it lay was solid black pavement, not a
 force-field. He must be in the lowest level of the city. He didn't
 know his way around; he might meet more enemies. He forgot about the
 books he'd wanted, and began to search for his hotel.
When he got back to his room, he went immediately to bed. He slept
 late.


 Malcomb woke him at 1100. Gavir told Malcomb about the
 strangely-dressed men who had tried to kill him.


 ""I told you not to wander around alone.""


 ""But you did not tell me that Earthmen might try to kill me. You have
 told me that Earthmen are good and peace-loving, that there have been
 no acts of violence on Earth for many decades. You have told me that
 only the MDC men are exceptions, because they are living off Earth,
 and this somehow makes them different.""


 ""Well, those people you ran into are another exception.""


 ""Why?""


 ""You know about the Regeneration and Rejuvenation treatment we have
 here on Earth. A variation of it was given you to acclimate you to
 Earth's gravity and atmosphere. Well, since the R&amp;R treatment was
 developed, we Earthmen have a life-expectancy of about one hundred
 fifty years. Those people who attacked you were Century-Plus. They are
 over a hundred years old, but as healthy, physically, as ever.""


 ""What is wrong with them?""


 ""They seem to have outgrown their Ethical Conditioning. They live
 wildly. Violently. It's a problem without precedent, and we don't know
 what to do with them. The fact is, Senile Delinquency is our number
 one problem.""


 ""Why not punish them?"" said Gavir.


 ""They're too powerful. They are often people who've pursued successful
 careers and acquired a good deal of property and position. And there
 are getting to be more of them all the time. But come on. You and I
 have to go over to Global Dreamcasting and collect our fee.""
The impeccably affable producer of
Dreaming Through the Universe
gave Malcomb a check and then asked them to follow him.


 ""Mr. Davery wants to see you. Mr.
Hoppy
Davery, executive
 vice-president in charge of production. Scion of one of Earth's oldest
 communications media families!""


 They went with the producer to the upper reaches of the Global
 Dreamcasting building. There they were ushered into a huge office.


 They found Mr. Hoppy Davery lounging on a divan the size of a
 space-port. He was youthful in appearance, as were all Earthmen, but a
 soft plumpness and a receding hairline made him look slightly older
 than average.


 He pointed a rigid finger at Malcomb and Gavir. ""I want you two to
 hear a condensed recording of statements taken from calls we received
 last night.""


 Gavir stiffened. They
had
gotten into trouble because of his
 thoughts about MDC.


 A voice boomed out of the ceiling.


 ""That Martian boy has power. That song was a fist in the jaw. More!""


 A woman's voice followed:


 ""If you let that boy go back to Mars I'll never dream a Global program
 again.""


 More voices:


 ""Enormous!""


 ""Potent!""


 ""That hunting song drove me mad. I
like
being mad!""


 ""Keep him on Earth.""


 Hoppy Davery pressed a button in the control panel on his divan, and
 the voices fell silent.


 ""Those callers that admitted their age were all Century-Plus. The boy
 appeals to the Century-Plus mentality. I want to try him again. This
 time on a really big dream-show, not just an educational 'cast. Got a
 spot on next week's Farfel Flisket Show. If he gets the right
 response, we talk about a contract. Okay?""


 Malcomb said, ""His visa expires—""


 ""We'll take care of his visa.""


 Gavir trembled with joy. Hoppy Davery pressed another button and a
 secretary entered with papers. She was followed by another woman.


 The second woman was dark-haired and slender. She wore leather boots
 and tight brown breeches. She was bare from the waist up and her
 breasts were young and full. A jewelled clip fastened a scarlet cape
 at her neck. Her lips were a disconcertingly vivid red, apparently an
 artificial color. She kissed Hoppy Davery on the forehead, leaving red
 blotches on his pink dome. He wiped his forehead and looked at his
 hand.


 ""Do you have to wear that barbaric face-paint?"" Hoppy turned sad eyes
 on Gavir and Malcomb. ""Gentlemen, my mother, Sylvie Davery.""


 A Senile Delinquent! thought Gavir. She looked like Davery's younger
 sister. Malcomb stared at her apprehensively, and Gavir wondered if
 she were somehow going to attack them.


 She looked at Gavir. ""Mmm. What a body, what gorgeous blue skin. How
 tall are you, Blue Boy?""


 ""He's approximately seven feet tall, Sylvie,"" said Hoppy, ""and what do
 you want here, anyway?""


 ""Just came up to see Blue Boy. One of the crowd dreamed him last
 night. Positively manic about him. I found out he'd be with you.""


 ""See?"" said Hoppy to Gavir. ""The Century-Plus mentality. You've got
 something they go for. Undoubtedly because you're—forgive me—such a
 complete barbarian. That's what they're all trying to be.""


 ""Spare me another lecture on Senile Delinquency, Our Number One
 Problem."" She walked to the door and Gavir watched her all the way.
 She turned with a swirl of scarlet and a dramatic display of healthy
 young flesh. ""See you again, Blue Boy.""


 After Sylvie left, Hoppy Davery said, ""That might be a good
 professional name—Blue Boy. Gavir doesn't
mean
anything. Now what
 kind of a song could you do for the Farfel Flisket show?""


 Gavir thought. ""Perhaps you would like the
Song of Creation
.""


 ""It's part of a fertility rite,"" Malcomb explained.


 ""Great! Give the Senile Delinquents another workout. It's not quite
 ethical, but its good for us. But for heaven's sake, Blue Boy, keep
 your mind off MDC!""
The following week, Gavir sang the
Song of Creation
on the Farfel
 Flisket show, and transmitted the images which it brought up in his
 mind to his audience. A jubilant Hoppy Davery called him at his hotel
 next morning.


 ""Best response I've ever seen! The Century-Plussers have been rioting
 and throwing mass orgies ever since you sang. But they take time out
 to call us up and beg for more. I've got a sponsor and a two-year
 contract lined up for you.""


 The sponsor was pacing back and forth in Hoppy Davery's office when
 Malcomb and Gavir arrived. Hoppy introduced him proudly. ""Mr. Jarvis
 Spurling, president of the Martian Development Corporation.""


 Gavir's hand leaped at the narvoon under his doublet.


 Then he stopped himself. He turned the gesture into the proffer of a
 handshake. ""How do you do?"" he said quietly. In his mind he
 congratulated himself. He had learned emotional control from the
 Earthmen. Here was the man who had ordered his father crucified! Yet
 he had managed to hide his instant desire to strike, to kill, to carry
 out the oath of the blood feud then and there.


 Jarvis Spurling ignored Gavir's hand and stared coldly at him. There
 was not a trace of the usual Earthman's kindliness in his square,
 battered face. ""I'm told you got talent. Okay, but a Bluie is a Bluie.
 I'll pay you because a Bluie on Dreamvision is good publicity for MDC
 products. But one slip like on your first 'cast and you go back to the
 Preserve.""


 ""Mr. Spurling!"" said Malcomb. ""Your tone is hostile!""


 ""Damn right. That Ethical Conditioning slop doesn't work on me. I've
 lived too long on the frontier. And I know Bluies.""
Iwill sign the contract,"" said Gavir.


 As he drew his signature pictograph on the contract, Sylvie Davery
 sauntered in. She held a white tube between her painted lips. The end
 of the tube was glowing and giving off clouds of smoke. Hoppy Davery
 coughed and Sylvie winked at Gavir. Gavir straightened up, and she
 took a long look at his seven feet.


 ""All finished, Blue Boy? Come on, let's go have a drink at Lucifer
 Grotto.""


 Caution told Gavir to refuse. But before he could speak Spurling
 snapped, ""Disgusting! An Earth woman and a Bluie! If you were on Mars,
 lady, we'd deport you so fast your tail would burn. And God help the
 Bluie!""


 Sylvie blew a cloud of smoke at Spurling. ""You're not on Mars, Jack.
 You're back in civilization where we do what we damned well please.""


 Spurling laughed. ""I've heard about you Century-Plussers. You're all
 sick.""


 ""You can't claim any monopoly on mental health. Not with that
 concentration camp you run on Mars. Coming, Gavir?""


 Gavir grinned at Spurling. ""The contract, I believe, does not cover my
 private life.""


 Hoppy Davery said, ""Sylvie, I don't think this is wise.""


 Sylvie uttered a short, sharp obscenity, linked arms with Gavir, and
 strolled out.


 ""You screwball Senile Delinquent,"" Spurling yelled after Sylvie, ""you
 oughtta be locked up!""
Lucifer Grotto was in that same quarter in which Gavir had been
 attacked. Sylvie told him it was
the
hangout for wealthier New York
 Century-Plussers. Gavir told her about the attack, and she laughed.
 ""It won't happen again. You're a hero to the Senile Delinquents now.
 By the way, the big fellow with the broad-brimmed hat, he's one of the
 most prominent Senile Delinquents of our day. He's president of the
 biggest privately-owned space line, but he likes to call himself the
 Hat Rat. You must be one of the few people who ever got away from him
 alive.""


 ""He seemed happy to get away from me,"" said Gavir.


 An arrangement of force-planes and 3V projections made the front of
 Lucifer Grotto appear to be a curtain of flames. Gavir hung back, but
 Sylvie inserted a tiny gold pitchfork into a small aperture in the
 glowing, rippling surface. The flames swept aside, revealing a
 doorway. A bearded man in black tights escorted them through a
 luridly-lit bar to a private room. When they were alone, Sylvie
 dropped her cape to the floor, sat on the edge of a huge, pink divan,
 and smiled at Gavir.


 Gavir contemplated her. That she was over a hundred years old was a
 little frightening. But the skin of her face and her bare upper body
 was a warm color, and tautly filled. She had lashed out at Spurling,
 and he liked her for that. But in one way she was like Spurling. She
 didn't fit into the bland, non-violent world of Malcomb and Hoppy.


 He shook his head. He said, ""Sylvie, why—well, why are you the way
 you are? Why—and how—have you broken away from Ethical
 Conditioning?""


 Sylvie frowned. She spoke a few words into the air, ordering drinks.
 She said, ""I didn't do it deliberately. When I reached the age of
 about a hundred it stopped working for me. I suddenly wanted to do
 what
I
wanted to do. And then I found out that I didn't
know
what
 I wanted to do. It was Ethical Conditioning or nothing, so I picked
 nothing. And here I am, chasing nothing.""


 ""How do you chase nothing?""


 She set fire to a white tube. ""This, for instance. They used to do it
 before they found out it caused cancer. Now there's no more cancer,
 but even if there were, I'd still smoke. That's the attitude I have.
 You try things. You live in the past, if you're inclined, adopt the
 costumes and manners of some more colorful time. You try ridiculous
 things, disgusting things, vicious things. You know they're all
 nothing, but you have to do something, so you go on doing nothing,
 elaborately and violently.""


 A tray of drinks rose through the floor. Sylvie frowned as she noticed
 a folded paper tucked between the glasses. She picked it up and read
 it, chuckled, and read it again, aloud.


 ""Sir: I beg you to forgive the presumption of my recent attack on
 you. Since then you have captured my imagination. I now hold you to be
 the noblest savage of them all. Henceforward please consider me, Your
 obedient servant, Hat Rat.""


 ""You've impressed him,"" said Sylvie. ""But you impress me even more.
 Come here.""


 She held out slim arms to him. He had no wish to refuse her. She was
 not like a Martian woman, but he found the differences exciting and
 attractive. He went to her, and he forgot entirely that she was over a
 hundred years old.
In the months that followed, Gavir's fame spread over Earth. By
 spring, the rating computers credited him with an audience of eight
 hundred million—ninety-five percent of whom were Century-Plussers.
 Davery doubled Gavir's salary.


 Gavir toured the world with Sylvie, mobbed everywhere by worshipful
 Century-Plussers. Male Century-Plussers by the millions adopted blue
 doublets and blue kilts in honor of their hero.


 Blue-dyed hair was now
de rigueur
among the ladies of Lucifer
 Grotto. The Hat Rat himself, who often appeared at a respectful
 distance in crowds around Gavir, now wore a wide-brimmed hat of
 brightest blue.


 Then there came the dreamcast on which Gavir sang the
Song of
 Complaint
.


 It was an ancient song, a Desert Man's outcry against injustice,
 enemies, false friends and callous leaders. It was a protest against
 sufferings that could neither be borne nor prevented. At the climax of
 the song Gavir pictured a tribal chief who refused to make fair
 division of the spoils of a hunt with his warriors. Gradually he
 allowed this image to turn into a picture of Hoppy Davery withholding
 bundles of money from a starving Gavir. Then he ended the song.


 Hoppy sent for him next morning.


 ""Why did you do that?"" he said. ""Listen to this.""


 A recorded voice boomed: ""This is Hat Rat. Pay the Blue Boy what he
 deserves, or I will give you death. It will be a personal thing
 between you and me. I will besprinkle you with corrosive acids; I will
 burn out your eyes; I will—""


 Hoppy cut the voice off. Gavir saw that he was sweating. ""There were
dozens
like that. If you want more money, I'll
give
you more
 money. Say something nice about me on your next dreamcast, for
 heaven's sake!""


 Gavir spread his big blue hands. ""I am sorry. I don't want more money.
 I cannot always control the pictures I make. These images come into
 my mind even though they have nothing to do with me.""


 Hoppy shook his head. ""That's because you haven't had Ethical
 Conditioning. We don't have this trouble with our other performers.
 You just must remember that dreamvision is the most potent
 communications medium ever devised. Be
careful
.""


 ""I will,"" said Gavir.
On his next dreamcast Gavir sang the
Song of the Blood Feud
. He
 pictured a Desert Man whose father had been killed by a drock.


 The Desert Man ran over the red sand, and he found the drock. He did
 not throw his knife. That would not have satisfied his hatred. He fell
 upon the drock and stabbed and stabbed.


 The Desert Man howled his hunting-cry over the body of his enemy, and
 spat into its face.


 And the fanged face of the drock turned into the square, battered face
 of Jarvis Spurling. Gavir held the image in his mind for a long
 moment.


 When the dreamcast was over, a studio page ran up to Gavir. ""Mr.
 Spurling wants to see you at once, at his office.""


 ""Let him come and find me,"" said Gavir. ""Let us go, Sylvie.""


 They went to Lucifer Grotto, where Gavir's wealthiest admirers among
 the Senile Delinquents were giving a party for him in the Pandemonium
 Room. The only prominent person missing, as Sylvie remarked after
 surveying the crowd, was the Hat Rat. They wondered about it, but no
 one knew where he was.


 Sheets of flame illuminated the wild features and strange garments of
 over a hundred Century-Plus ladies and gentlemen. Gouts of flame
 leaped from the walls to light antique-style cigarettes. Drinks were
 refilled from nozzles of molded fire.


 An hour passed from the time of Gavir's arrival.


 Then Jarvis Spurling joined the party. There was a heavy frontier
 sonic pistol strapped at his waist. A protesting Malcomb was behind
 him.


 Jarvis Spurling's square face was dark with anger. ""You deliberately
 put my face on that animal! You want to make the public hate me. I pay
 your salary and keep you here on Earth, and this is what I get for it.
 All right. A Bluie is a Bluie, and I'll treat you like a Bluie should
 be treated."" He unsnapped his holster and drew the square, heavy
 pistol out and pointed it at Gavir.


 Gavir stood up. His right hand plucked at his doublet.


 ""You're itching to go for that throwing knife,"" said Spurling. ""Go on!
 Take it out and get ready to throw it. I'll give you that much
 chance. Let's make a game out of this. We'll make like we're back on
 Mars, Bluie, and you're out hunting a drock. And you find one, only
 this drock has a gun. How about that, Bluie?""


 Gavir took out the narvoon, grasped the blade, and drew his arm back.


 ""Gavir!""


 It was the Hat Rat. He stood between pillars of flame in the doorway
 of the Pandemonium Room of Lucifer Grotto, and there was a peculiar
 contrivance of dark brown wood and black metal tubing cradled in his
 arm. ""This ancient shotgun I dedicate to your blood feud. I shall hunt
 down your enemy, Gavir!""


 Spurling turned. The Hat Rat saw him.


 ""The enemy!"" the Hat Rat shouted.


 The shotgun exploded.


 Spurling's body was thrown back against Gavir. Gavir saw a huge ragged
 red caved-in place in Spurling's chest. Spurling's body sagged to the
 floor and lay there face up, eyes open. The Senile Delinquents of
 Lucifer Grotto leaned forward to grin at the tattered body.


 Still holding the narvoon, Gavir stood over his dead enemy. He threw
 back his head and howled out the hunting cry of the Desert Men. Then
 he looked down and spat in Jarvis Spurling's dead face.

Stalemate In Space
By CHARLES L. HARNESS
Two mighty metal globes clung in a murderous

 death-struggle, lashing out with flames of poison.

 Yet deep in their twisted, radioactive wreckage

 the main battle raged—where a girl swayed

 sensuously before her conqueror's mocking eyes.


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

At first there was only the voice, a monotonous murmur in her ears.


 ""
Die now—die now—die now
—""


 Evelyn Kane awoke, breathing slowly and painfully. The top of the
 cubicle was bulging inward on her chest, and it seemed likely that a
 rib or two was broken. How long ago? Years? Minutes? She had no way of
 knowing. Her slender right hand found the oxygen valve and turned it.
 For a long while she lay, hurting and breathing helplessly.


 ""
Die now—die now—die now
—""


 The votron had awakened her with its heart-breaking code message, and
 it was her duty to carry out its command. Nine years after the great
 battle globes had crunched together the mentors had sealed her in this
 tiny cell, dormant, unwaking, to be livened only when it was certain
 her countrymen had either definitely won—or lost.


 The votron's telepathic dirge chronicled the latter fact. She had
 expected nothing else.


 She had only to find the relay beside her cot, press the key that would
 set in motion gigantic prime movers in the heart of the great globe,
 and the conquerors would join the conquered in the wide and nameless
 grave of space.


 But life, now doled out by the second, was too delicious to abandon
 immediately. Her mind, like that of a drowning person, raced hungrily
 over the memories of her past.


 For twenty years, in company with her great father, she had watched
The Defender
grow from a vast metal skeleton into a planet-sized
 battle globe. But it had not grown fast enough, for when the Scythian
 globe,
The Invader
, sprang out of black space to enslave the budding
 Terran Confederacy,
The Defender
was unfinished, half-equipped, and
 undermanned.


 The Terrans could only fight for time and hope for a miracle.
The Defender
, commanded by her father, Gordon, Lord Kane, hurled
 itself from its orbit around Procyon and met
The Invader
with giant
 fission torpedoes.


 And then, in an intergalactic proton storm beyond the Lesser Magellanic
 Cloud, the globes lost their bearings and collided. Hordes of brute-men
 poured through the crushed outer armor of the stricken
Defender
.


 The prone woman stirred uneasily. Here the images became unreal
 and terrible, with the recurrent vision of death. It had taken the
 Scythians nine years to conquer
The Defender's
outer shell. Then had
 come that final interview with her father.


 ""In half an hour our last space port will be captured,"" he had
 telepathed curtly. ""Only one more messenger ship can leave
The
 Defender
. Be on it.""


 ""No. I shall die here.""


 His fine tired eyes had studied her face in enigmatic appraisal. ""Then
 die usefully. The mentors are trying to develop a force that will
 destroy both globes in the moment of our inevitable defeat. If they are
 successful, you will have the task of pressing the final button of the
 battle.""


 ""There's an off-chance you may survive,"" countered a mentor. ""We're
 also working on a means for your escape—not only because you are
 Gordon's daughter, but because this great proton storm will prevent
 radio contact with Terra for years, and we want someone to escape with
 our secret if and when our experiments prove successful.""


 ""But you must expect to die,"" her father had warned with gentle
 finality.


 She clenched her fingernails vehemently into her palms and wrenched
 herself back to the present.


 That time had come.


 With some effort she worked herself out of the crumpled bed and lay on
 the floor of her little cubicle, panting and holding her chest with
 both hands. The metal floor was very cold. Evidently the enemy torpedo
 fissionables had finally broken through to the center portions of the
 ship, letting in the icy breath of space. Small matter. Not by freezing
 would she die.


 She reached out her hand, felt for the all-important key, and gasped in
 dismay. The mahogany box containing the key had burst its metal bonds
 and was lying on its side. The explosion that had crushed her cubicle
 had been terrific.


 With a gurgle of horror she snapped on her wrist luminar and examined
 the interior of the box.


 It was a shattered ruin.
Once the fact was clear, she composed herself and lay there, breathing
 hard and thinking. She had no means to construct another key. At best,
 finding the rare tools and parts would take months, and during the
 interval the invaders would be cutting loose from the dead hulk that
 clutched their conquering battle globe in a metallic rigor mortis.


 She gave herself six weeks to accomplish this stalemate in space.


 Within that time she must know whether the prime movers were still
 intact, and whether she could safely enter the pile room herself,
 set the movers in motion, and draw the moderator columns. If it were
 unsafe, she must secure the unwitting assistance of her Scythian
 enemies.


 Still prone, she found the first-aid kit and taped her chest expertly.
 The cold was beginning to make itself felt, so she flicked on the
 chaudiere she wore as an under-garment to her Scythian woman's uniform.
 Then she crawled on her elbows and stomach to the tiny door, spun the
 sealing gear, and was soon outside. Ignoring the pain and pulling on
 the side of the imitation rock that contained her cell, she got slowly
 to her feet. The air was thin indeed, and frigid. She turned the valve
 of her portable oxygen bottle almost subconsciously, while exploring
 the surrounding blackened forest as far as she could see. Mentally she
 was alert for roving alien minds. She had left her weapons inside the
 cubicle, except for the three things in the little leather bag dangling
 from her waist, for she knew that her greatest weapon in the struggle
 to come would be her apparent harmlessness.


 Four hundred yards behind her she detected the mind of a low-born
 Scythe, of the Tharn sun group. Very quickly she established it as that
 of a tired, brutish corporal, taking a mop-up squad through the black
 stumps and forlorn branches of the small forest that for years had
 supplied oxygen to the defenders of this sector.


 The corporal could not see her green Scythian uniform clearly, and
 evidently took her for a Terran woman. In his mind was the question:
 Should he shoot immediately, or should he capture her? It had been two
 months since he had seen a woman. But then, his orders were to shoot.
 Yes, he would shoot.


 Evelyn turned in profile to the beam-gun and stretched luxuriously,
 hoping that her grimace of pain could not be detected. With
 satisfaction, she sensed a sudden change of determination in the mind
 of the Tharn. The gun was lowered, and the man was circling to creep up
 behind her. He did not bother to notify his men. He wanted her first.
 He had seen her uniform, but that deterred him not a whit. Afterwards,
 he would call up the squad. Finally, they would kill her and move on.
 Women auxiliaries had no business here, anyway.


 Hips dipping, Evelyn sauntered into the shattered copse. The man moved
 faster, though still trying to approach quietly. Most of the radions in
 the mile-high ceiling had been destroyed, and the light was poor. He
 was not surprised when he lost track of his quarry. He tip-toed rapidly
 onward, picking his way through the charred and fallen branches,
 thinking that she must turn up again soon. He had not gone twenty yards
 in this manner when a howl of unbearable fury sounded in his mind, and
 the dull light in his brain went out.
She fought for her life under that mile-high ceiling.
Breathing deeply from her mental effort, the woman stepped from
 behind a great black tree trunk and hurried to the unconscious man.
 For I.Q.'s of 100 and less, telepathic cortical paralysis was quite
 effective. With cool efficiency and no trace of distaste she stripped
 the odorous uniform from the man, then took his weapon, turned the beam
 power down very low, and needled a neat slash across his throat. While
 he bled to death, she slipped deftly into the baggy suit, clasped the
 beam gun by the handle, and started up the sooty slope. For a time, at
 least, it would be safer to pass as a Tharn soldier than as any kind of
 a woman.
II


 The inquisitor leaned forward, frowning at the girl before him.


 ""Name?""


 ""Evelyn Kane.""


 The eyes of the inquisitor widened. ""So you admit to a Terran name.
 Well, Terran, you are charged with having stolen passage on a supply
 lorry, and you also seem to be wearing the uniform of an infantry
 corporal as well as that of a Scythian woman auxiliary. Incidentally,
 where is the corporal? Did you kill him?""


 He was prepared for a last-ditch denial. He would cut it short, have
 the guards remove her, and execution would follow immediately. In a
 way, it was unfortunate. The woman was obviously of a high Terran
 class. No—he couldn't consider that. His slender means couldn't afford
 another woman in his quarters, and besides, he wouldn't feel safe with
 this cool murderess.


 ""Do you not understand the master tongue? Why did you kill the
 corporal?"" He leaned impatiently over his desk.


 The woman stared frankly back at him with her clear blue eyes. The
 guards on either side of her dug their nails into her arms, as was
 their custom with recalcitrant prisoners, but she took no notice.


 She had analyzed the minds of the three men. She could handle the
 inquisitor alone or the two guards alone, but not all three.


 ""If you aren't afraid of me, perhaps you'd be so kind as to send the
 guards out for a few minutes,"" she said, placing a hand on her hip. ""I
 have interesting information.""


 So that was it. Buy her freedom by betraying fugitive Terrans. Well, he
 could take the information and then kill her. He nodded curtly to the
 guards, and they walked out of the hut, exchanging sly winks with one
 another.


 Evelyn Kane crossed her arms across her chest and felt her broken rib
 gingerly. The inquisitor stared up at her in sadistic admiration. He
 would certainly be on hand for the execution. His anticipation was cut
 short with a horrible realization. Under the paralyzing force of a mind
 greater than his own, he reached beneath the desk and switched off the
 recorder.


 ""Who is the Occupational Commandant for this Sector,"" she asked
 tersely. This must be done swiftly before the guards returned.


 ""Perat, Viscount of Tharn,"" replied the man mechanically.


 ""What is the extent of his jurisdiction?""


 ""From the center of the Terran globe, outward four hundred miles
 radius.""


 ""Good. Prepare for me the usual visa that a woman clerk needs for
 passage to the offices of the Occupational Commandant.""


 The inquisitor filled in blanks in a stiff sheet of paper and stamped a
 seal at its bottom.


 ""You will add in the portion reserved for 'comments', the following:
 'Capable clerk. Others will follow as they are found available.'""


 The man's pen scratched away obediently.


 Evelyn Kane smiled gently at the impotent, inwardly raging inquisitor.
 She took the paper, folded it, and placed it in a pocket in her blouse.
 ""Call the guards,"" she ordered.


 He pressed the button on his desk, and the guards re-entered.


 ""This person is no longer a prisoner,"" said the inquisitor woodenly.
 ""She is to take the next transport to the Occupational Commandant of
 Zone One.""


 When the transport had left, neither inquisitor nor guards had any
 memory of the woman. However, in the due course of events, the
 recording was gathered up with many others like it, boxed carefully,
 and sent to the Office of the Occupational Commandant, Zone One, for
 auditing.
Evelyn was extremely careful with her mental probe as she descended
 from the transport. The Occupational Commandant would undoubtedly
 be high-born and telepathic. He must not have occasion to suspect a
 similar ability in a mere clerk.


 Fighting had passed this way, too, and recently. Many of the buildings
 were still smoking, and many of the radions high above were either
 shot out or obscured by slowly drifting dust clouds. The acrid odor of
 radiation-remover was everywhere.


 She caught the sound of spasmodic small-arm fire.


 ""What is that?"" she asked the transport attendant.


 ""The Commandant is shooting prisoners,"" he replied laconically.


 ""Oh.""


 ""Where did you want to go?""


 ""To the personnel office.""


 ""That way."" He pointed to the largest building of the group—two
 stories high, reasonably intact.


 She walked off down the gravel path, which was stained here and there
 with dark sticky red. She gave her visa to the guard at the door and
 was admitted to an improvised waiting room, where another guard eyed
 her stonily. The firing was much nearer. She recognized the obscene
 coughs of a Faeg pistol and began to feel sick.


 A woman in the green uniform of the Scythe auxiliary came in, whispered
 something to the guard, and then told Evelyn to follow her.


 In the anteroom a grey cat looked her over curiously, and Evelyn
 frowned. She might have to get rid of the cat if she stayed here. Under
 certain circumstances the animal could prove her deadliest enemy.


 The next room held a foppish little man, evidently a supervisor of some
 sort, who was studying her visa.


 ""I'm very happy to have you here, S'ria—ah—""—he looked at the visa
 suspiciously—""S'ria Lyn. Do sit down. But, as I was just remarking to
 S'ria Gerek, here""—he nodded to the other woman, who smiled back—""I
 wish the field officers would make up their august minds as to whether
 they want you or don't want you. Just why did they transfer you to
 H.Q.?""


 She thought quickly. This pompous little ass would have to be given
 some answer that would keep him from checking with the inquisitor. It
 would have to be something personal. She looked at the false black in
 his eyebrows and sideburns, and the artificial way in which he had
 combed hair over his bald spot. She crossed her knees slowly, ignoring
 the narrowing eyes of S'ria Gerek, and smoothed the back of her braided
 yellow hair. He was studying her covertly.


 ""The men in the fighting zones are uncouth, S'ria Gorph,"" she said
 simply. ""I was told that
you
, that is, I mean—""


 ""Yes?"" he was the soul of graciousness. S'ria Gerek began to dictate
 loudly into her mechanical transcriber.


 Evelyn cleared her throat, averted her eyes, and with some effort,
 managed a delicate flush. ""I meant to say, I thought I would be happier
 working for—working here. So I asked for a transfer.""


 S'ria Gorph beamed. ""Splendid. But the occupation isn't over, yet,
 you know. There'll be hard work here for several weeks yet, before we
 cut loose from the enemy globe. But you do your work well""—winking
 artfully—""and I'll see that—""


 He stopped, and his face took on a hunted look of mingled fear and
 anxiety. He appeared to listen.


 Evelyn tensed her mind to receive and deceive a mental probe. She was
 certain now that the Zone Commandant was high-born and telepathic. The
 chances were only fifty-fifty that she could delude him for any length
 of time if he became interested in her. He must be avoided if at all
 possible. It should not be too difficult. He undoubtedly had a dozen
 personal secretaries and/or concubines and would take small interest in
 the lowly employees that amused Gorph.


 Gorph looked at her uncertainly. ""Perat, Viscount of the Tharn Suns,
 sends you his compliments and wishes to see you on the balcony."" He
 pointed to a hallway. ""All the way through there, across to the other
 wing.""


 As she left, she heard all sound in the room stop. The transcribing and
 calculating machines trailed off into a watchful silence, and she could
 feel the eyes of the men and women on her back. She noticed then that
 the Faeg had ceased firing.
Her heart was beating faster as she walked down the hall. She felt a
 very strong probe flooding over her brain casually, palping with mild
 interest the artificial memories she supplied: Escapades with officers
 in the combat areas. Reprimands. Demotion and transfer. Her deception
 of Gorph. Her anticipation of meeting a real Viscount and hoping he
 would let her dance for him.


 The questing probe withdrew as idly as it had come, and she breathed
 a sigh of relief. She could not hope to deceive a suspicious telepath
 for long. Perat was merely amused at her ""lie"" to his under-supervisor.
 He had accepted her at her own face value, as supplied by her false
 memories.


 She opened the door to the balcony and saw a man leaning moodily on the
 balustrade. He gave no immediate notice of her presence.


 The five hundred and sixth heir of Tharn was of uncertain age, as were
 most of the men of both globes. Only the left side of his face could be
 seen. It was gaunt and leathery, and a deep thin scar lifted the corner
 of his mouth into a satanic smile. A faint paunch was gathering at his
 abdomen, as befitted a warrior turned to boring paper work. His closely
 cut black hair and the two sparkling red-gemmed rings—apparently
 identical—on his right hand seemed to denote a certain fastidiousness
 and unconscious superiority. To Evelyn the jeweled fingers bespoke an
 unnatural contrast to the past history of the man and were symptomatic
 of a personality that could find stimulation only in strange and cruel
 pleasures.


 In alarm she suddenly realized that she had inadvertently let her
 appraisal penetrate her uncovered conscious mind, and that this probe
 was there awaiting it.


 ""You are right,"" he said coldly, still staring into the court below.
 ""Now that the long battle is over, there is little left to divert me.""


 He pushed the Faeg across the coping toward her. ""Take this.""


 He had not as yet looked at her.


 She crossed the balcony, simultaneously grasping the pistol he offered
 her and looking down into the courtyard. There seemed to be nearly
 twenty Terrans lying about, in pools of their own blood.


 Only one man, a Terran officer of very high rank—was left standing.
 His arms were folded somberly across his chest, and he studied the
 killer above him almost casually. But when the woman came out, their
 eyes met, and he started imperceptibly.


 Evelyn Kane felt a horrid chill creeping over her. The man's hair was
 white, now, and his proud face lined with deep furrows, but there could
 be no mistake. It was Gordon, Lord Kane.


 Her father.


 The sweat continued to grow on her forehead, and she felt for a moment
 that she needed only to wish hard enough, and this would be a dream.
 A dream of a big, kind, dark-haired man with laugh-wrinkles about his
 eyes, who sat her on his knee when she was a little girl and read
 bedtime stories to her from a great book with many pictures.


 An icy, amused voice came through: ""Our orders are to kill all
 prisoners. It is entertaining to shoot down helpless men, isn't it? It
 warms me to know that I am cruel and wanton, and worthy of my trust.""


 Even in the midst of her horror, a cold, analytical part of her was
 explaining why the Commandant had called her to the balcony. Because
 all captured Terrans had to be killed, he hated his superiors, his own
 men, and especially the prisoners. A task so revolting he could not
 relegate to his own officers. He must do it himself, but he wanted his
 underlings to know he loathed them for it. She was merely a symbol of
 that contempt. His next words did not surprise her.


 ""It is even more stimulating to require a shuddering female to kill
 them. You are shuddering you know?""


 She nodded dumbly. Her palm was so wet that a drop of sweat dropped
 from it to the floor. She was thinking hard. She could kill the
 Commandant and save her father for a little while. But then the
 problem of detonating the pile remained, and it would not be solved
 more quickly by killing the man who controlled the pile area. On the
 contrary if she could get him interested in her—


 ""So far as our records indicate,"" murmured Perat, ""the man down there
 is the last living Terran within
The Defender
. It occurred to me that
 our newest clerk would like to start off her duties with a bang. The
 Faeg is adjusted to a needle-beam. If you put a bolt between the man's
 eyes, you may dance for me tonight, and perhaps there will be other
 nights—""


 The woman seemed lost in thought for a long time. Slowly, she lifted
 the ugly little weapon. The doomed Terran looked up at her peacefully,
 without expression. She lowered the Faeg, her arm trembling.


 Gordon, Lord Kane, frowned faintly, then closed his eyes. She raised
 the gun again, drew cross hairs with a nerveless wrist, and squeezed
 the trigger. There was a loud, hollow cough, but no recoil. The Terran
 officer, his eyes still closed and arms folded, sank to the ground,
 face up. Blood was running from a tiny hole in his forehead.


 The man leaning on the balustrade turned and looked at Evelyn, at first
 with amused contempt, then with narrowing, questioning eyes.


 ""Come here,"" he ordered.


 The Faeg dropped from her hand. With a titanic effort she activated her
 legs and walked toward him.


 He was studying her face very carefully.


 She felt that she was going to be sick. Her knees were so weak that she
 had to lean on the coping.


 With a forefinger he lifted up the mass of golden curls that hung
 over her right forehead and examined the scar hidden there, where the
 mentors had cut into her frontal lobe. The tiny doll they had created
 for her writhed uneasily in her waist-purse, but Perat seemed to be
 thinking of something else, and missed the significance of the scar
 completely.


 He dropped his hand. ""I'm sorry,"" he said with a quiet weariness. ""I
 shouldn't have asked you to kill the Terran. It was a sorry joke.""
 Then: ""Have you ever seen me before?""


 ""No,"" she whispered hoarsely. His mind was in hers, verifying the fact.


 ""Have you ever met my father, Phaen, the old Count of Tharn?""


 ""No.""


 ""Do you have a son?""


 ""No.""


 His mind was out of hers again, and he had turned moodily back,
 surveying the courtyard and the dead. ""Gorph will be wondering what
 happened to you. Come to my quarters at the eighth metron tonight.""


 Apparently he suspected nothing.
Father. Father. I had to do it. But we'll all join you, soon. Soon.
III


 Perat lay on his couch, sipping cold purple
terif
and following the
 thinly-clad dancer with narrowed eyes. Music, soft and subtle, floated
 from his communications box, illegally tuned to an officer's club
 somewhere. Evelyn made the rhythm part of her as she swayed slowly on
 tiptoe.


 For the last thirty ""nights""—the hours allotted to rest and sleep—it
 had been thus. By ""day"" she probed furtively into the minds of the
 office staff, memorizing area designations, channels for official
 messages, and the names and authorizations of occupational field crews.
 By night she danced for Perat, who never took his eyes from her, nor
 his probe from her mind. While she danced it was not too difficult to
 elude the probe. There was an odd autohypnosis in dancing that blotted
 out memory and knowledge.


 ""Enough for now,"" he ordered. ""Careful of your rib.""


 When he had first seen the bandages on her bare chest, that first
 night, she had been ready with a memory of dancing on a freshly waxed
 floor, and of falling.


 Perat seemed to be debating with himself as she sat down on her own
 couch to rest. He got up, unlocked his desk, and drew out a tiny reel
 of metal wire, which Evelyn recognized as being feed for an amateur
 stereop projector. He placed the reel in a projector that had been
 installed in the wall, flicked off the table luminar, and both of them
 waited in the dark, breathing rather loudly.


 Suddenly the center of the room was bright with a ball of light some
 two feet in diameter, and inside the luminous sphere were an old man, a
 woman, and a little boy of about four years. They were walking through
 a luxurious garden, and then they stopped, looked up, and waved gaily.


 Evelyn studied the trio with growing wonder. The old man and the boy
 were complete strangers.
But the woman—!
""That is Phaen, my father,"" said Perat quietly. ""He stayed at home
 because he hated war. And that is a path in our country estate on
 Tharn-R-VII. The little boy I fail to recognize, beyond a general
 resemblance to the Tharn line.


 ""But—
can you deny that you are the woman
?""


 The stereop snapped off, and she sat wordless in the dark.


 ""There seemed to be some similarity—"" she admitted. Her throat was
 suddenly dry. Yet, why should she be alarmed? She really didn't know
 the woman.


 The table luminar was on now, and Perat was prowling hungrily about the
 room, his scar twisting his otherwise handsome face into a snarling
 scowl.


 ""Similarity! Bah! That loop of hair over her right forehead hid a scar
 identical to yours. I have had the individual frames analyzed!""


 Evelyn's hands knotted unconsciously. She forced her body to relax, but
 her mind was racing. This introduced another variable to be controlled
 in her plan for destruction. She
must
make it a known quantity.


 ""Did your father send it to you?"" she asked.


 ""The day before you arrived here. It had been en route for months, of
 course.""


 ""What did he say about it?""


 ""He said, 'Your widow and son send greetings. Be of good cheer, and
 accept our love.' What nonsense! He knows very well I'm not married and
 that—well, if I have ever fathered any children, I don't know about
 them.""


 ""Is that all he said?""


 ""That's all, except that he included this ring."" He pulled one of the
 duplicate jewels from his right middle finger and tossed it to her.
 ""It's identical to the one he had made for me when I entered on my
 majority. For a long time it was thought that it was the only stone of
 its kind on all the planets of the Tharn suns, a mineralogical freak,
 but I guess he found another. But why should I want two of them?""


 Evelyn crossed the room and returned the ring.


 ""Existence is so full of mysteries, isn't it?"" murmured Perat.
 ""Sometimes it seems unfortunate that we must pass through a sentient
 phase on our way to death. This foolish, foolish war. Maybe the old
 count was right.""


 ""You could be courtmartialed for that.""


 ""Speaking of courtmartials, I've got to attend one tonight—an appeal
 from a death sentence."" He arose, smoothed his hair and clothes, and
 poured another glass of
terif
. ""Some fool inquisitor can't show
 proper disposition of a woman prisoner.""


 Evelyn's heart skipped a beat. ""Indeed?""


 ""The wretch insists that he could remember if we would just let him
 alone. I suppose he took a bribe. You'll find one now and then who
 tries for a little extra profit.""


 She must absolutely not be seen by the condemned inquisitor. The
 stimulus would almost certainly make him remember.


 ""I'll wait for you,"" she said indifferently, thrusting her arms out in
 a languorous yawn.


 ""Very well."" Perat stepped to the door, then turned and looked back at
 her. ""On the other hand, I may need a clerk. It's way after hours, and
 the others have gone.""


 Beneath a gesture of wry protest, she swallowed rapidly.


 ""Perhaps you'd better come,"" insisted Perat.


 She stood up, unloosed her waist-purse, checked its contents swiftly,
 and then followed him out.


 This might be a very close thing. From the purse she took a bottle of
 perfume and rubbed her ear lobes casually.


 ""Odd smell,"" commented Perat, wrinkling his nose.


 ""Odd scent,"" corrected Evelyn cryptically. She was thinking about
 the earnest faces of the mentors as they instructed her carefully in
 the use of the ""perfume."" The adrenalin glands, they had explained,
 provided a useful and powerful stimulant to a man in danger. Adrenalin
 slowed the heart and digestion, increased the systole and blood
 pressure, and increased perspiration to cool the skin. But there
 could be too much of a good thing. An overdose of adrenalin, they had
 pointed out, caused almost immediate edema. The lungs filled rapidly
 with the serum and the victim ... drowned. The perfume she possessed
 over-stimulated, in some unknown way, the adrenals of frightened
 persons. It had no effect on inactive adrenals.


 The question remained—who would be the more frightened, she or the
 condemned inquisitor?


 She was perspiring freely, and the blonde hair on her arms and neck was
 standing stiffly when Perat opened the door for her and they entered
 the Zone Provost's chambers.

There's a place for every man and a man for
 
every place, but on robot-harried Mars the
 
situation was just a little different.

Harper Breen sank down gingerly into the new Relaxo-Lounge. He placed
 twitching hands on the arm-rests and laid his head back stiffly. He
 closed his fluttering eyelids and clamped his mouth to keep the corner
 from jumping.


 ""Just lie back, Harp,"" droned his sister soothingly. ""Just give in and
 let go of everything.""


 Harper tried to let go of everything. He gave in to the chair. And
 gently the chair went to work. It rocked rhythmically, it vibrated
 tenderly. With velvety cushions it massaged his back and arms and legs.


 For all of five minutes Harper stood it. Then with a frenzied lunge
 he escaped the embrace of the Relaxo-Lounge and fled to a gloriously
 stationary sofa.


 ""Harp!"" His sister, Bella, was ready to weep with exasperation. ""Dr.
 Franz said it would be just the thing for you! Why won't you give it a
 trial?""


 Harper glared at the preposterous chair. ""Franz!"" he snarled. ""That
 prize fathead! I've paid him a fortune in fees. I haven't slept for
 weeks. I can't eat anything but soup. My nerves are jangling like
 a four-alarm fire. And what does he prescribe? A blasted jiggling
 baby carriage! Why, I ought to send him the bill for it!"" Completely
 outraged, he lay back on the couch and closed his eyes.


 ""Now, Harp, you know you've never obeyed his orders. He told you
 last year that you'd have to ease up. Why do you have to try to run
 the whole world? It's the strain of all your business worries that's
 causing your trouble. He told you to take a long vacation or you'd
 crack up. Don't blame him for your own stubbornness.""


 Harper snorted. His large nose developed the sound magnificently.
 ""Vacation!"" he snorted. ""Batting a silly ball around or dragging a hook
 after a stupid fish! Fine activities for an intelligent middle-aged
 man! And let me correct you. It isn't business worries that are driving
 me to a crack-up. It's the strain of trying to get some sensible,
 reasonable coöperation from the nincompoops I have to hire! It's the
 idiocy of the human race that's got me whipped! It's the—""


 ""Hey, Harp, old man!"" His brother-in-law, turning the pages of the
 new colorama magazine, INTERPLANETARY, had paused at a double-spread.
 ""Didn't you have a finger in those Martian equatorial wells they sunk
 twenty years ago?""


 Harper's hands twitched violently. ""Don't mention that fiasco!"" he
 rasped. ""That deal nearly cost me my shirt! Water, hell! Those wells
 spewed up the craziest conglomeration of liquids ever tapped!""
Scribney, whose large, phlegmatic person and calm professorial brain
 were the complete antithesis of Harper's picked-crow physique and
 scheming financier's wits, looked severely over his glasses. Harp's
 nervous tribulations were beginning to bore him, as well as interfere
 with the harmony of his home.


 ""You're away behind the times, Harp,"" he declared. ""Don't you know
 that those have proved to be the most astoundingly curative springs
 ever discovered anywhere? Don't you know that a syndicate has built
 the largest extra-terrestial hotel of the solar system there and that
 people are flocking to it to get cured of whatever ails 'em? Old man,
 you missed a bet!""


 Leaping from the sofa, Harper rudely snatched the magazine from
 Scribney's hands. He glared at the spread which depicted a star-shaped
 structure of bottle-green glass resting jewel-like on the rufous rock
 of Mars. The main portion of the building consisted of a circular
 skyscraper with a glass-domed roof. Between its star-shaped annexes,
 other domes covered landscaped gardens and noxious pools which in the
 drawing looked lovely and enticing.


 ""Why, I remember now!"" exclaimed Bella. ""That's where the Durants went
 two years ago! He was about dead and she looked like a hag. They came
 back in wonderful shape. Don't you remember, Scrib?""


 Dutifully Scribney remembered and commented on the change the Martian
 springs had effected in the Durants. ""It's the very thing for you,
 Harp,"" he advised. ""You'd get a good rest on the way out. This gas
 they use in the rockets nowadays is as good as a rest-cure; it sort of
 floats you along the time-track in a pleasant daze, they tell me. And
 you can finish the cure at the hotel while looking it over. And not
 only that."" Confidentially he leaned toward his insignificant looking
 brother-in-law. ""The chemists over at Dade McCann have just isolated an
 enzyme from one species of Martian fungus that breaks down crude oil
 into its components without the need for chemical processing. There's a
 fortune waiting for the man who corners that fungus market and learns
 to process the stuff!""


 Scribney had gauged his victim's mental processes accurately. The
 magazine sagged in Harp's hands, and his sharp eyes became shrewd and
 calculating. He even forgot to twitch. ""Maybe you're right, Scrib,"" he
 acknowledged. ""Combine a rest-cure with business, eh?""


 Raising the magazine, he began reading the advertisement. And that
 was when he saw the line about the robots. ""—the only hotel staffed
 entirely with robot servants—""


 ""Robots!"" he shrilled. ""You mean they've developed the things to that
 point? Why hasn't somebody told me? I'll have Jackson's hide! I'll
 disfranchise him! I'll—""


 ""Harp!"" exploded Bella. ""Stop it! Maybe Jackson doesn't know a thing
 about it, whatever it is! If it's something at the Emerald Star Hotel,
 why don't you just go and find out for yourself instead of throwing a
 tantrum? That's the only sensible way!""


 ""You're right, Bella,"" agreed Harper incisively. ""I'll go and find out
 for myself. Immediately!"" Scooping up his hat, he left at his usual
 lope.


 ""Well!"" remarked his sister. ""All I can say is that they'd better turn
 that happy-gas on extra strong for Harp's trip out!""
The trip out did Harper a world of good. Under the influence of the
 soporific gas that permeated the rocket, he really relaxed for the
 first time in years, sinking with the other passengers into a hazy
 lethargy with little sense of passing time and almost no memory of the
 interval.


 It seemed hardly more than a handful of hours until they were strapping
 themselves into deceleration hammocks for the landing. And then Harper
 was waking with lassitude still heavy in his veins. He struggled out of
 the hammock, made his way to the airlock, and found himself whisked by
 pneumatic tube directly into the lobby of the Emerald Star Hotel.


 Appreciatively he gazed around at the half-acre of moss-gray carpeting,
 green-tinted by the light sifting through the walls of Martian
 copper-glass, and at the vistas of beautiful domed gardens framed by a
 dozen arches. But most of all, the robots won his delighted approval.


 He could see at once that they had been developed to an amazingly high
 state of perfection. How, he wondered again, had this been done without
 his knowledge? Was Scrib right? Was he slipping? Gnawing at the doubt,
 he watched the robots moving efficiently about, pushing patients in
 wheelchairs, carrying trays, guiding newcomers, performing janitorial
 duties tirelessly, promptly, and best of all, silently.


 Harper was enthralled. He'd staff his offices with them. Hang the
 expense! There'd be no more of that obnoxious personal friction and
 proneness to error that was always deviling the most carefully trained
 office staffs! He'd investigate and find out the exact potentialities
 of these robots while here, and then go home and introduce them into
 the field of business. He'd show them whether he was slipping! Briskly
 he went over to the desk.


 He was immediately confronted with a sample of that human obstinacy
 that was slowly driving him mad. Machines, he sighed to himself.
 Wonderful silent machines! For a woman was arguing stridently with the
 desk clerk who, poor man, was a high strung fellow human instead of a
 robot. Harper watched him shrinking and turning pale lavender in the
 stress of the argument.


 ""A nurse!"" shouted the woman. ""I want a nurse! A real woman! For what
 you charge, you should be able to give me a television star if I want
 one! I won't have another of those damnable robots in my room, do you
 hear?""


 No one within the confines of the huge lobby could have helped hearing.
 The clerk flinched visibly. ""Now, Mrs. Jacobsen,"" he soothed. ""You know
 the hotel is staffed entirely with robots. They're much more expensive,
 really, than human employees, but so much more efficient, you know.
 Admit it, they give excellent service, don't they, now?"" Toothily he
 smiled at the enraged woman.


 ""That's just it!"" Mrs. Jacobsen glared. ""The service is
too
good.
 I might just as well have a set of push buttons in the room. I want
 someone to
hear
what I say! I want to be able to change my mind once
 in awhile!""


 Harper snorted. ""Wants someone she can devil,"" he diagnosed. ""Someone
 she can get a kick out of ordering around."" With vast contempt he
 stepped to the desk beside her and peremptorily rapped for the clerk.


 ""One moment, sir,"" begged that harassed individual. ""Just one moment,
 please."" He turned back to the woman.


 But she had turned her glare on Harper. ""You could at least be civil
 enough to wait your turn!""


 Harper smirked. ""My good woman, I'm not a robot. Robots, of course,
 are always civil. But you should know by now that civility isn't a
 normal human trait."" Leaving her temporarily quashed, he beckoned
 authoritatively to the clerk.


 ""I've just arrived and want to get settled. I'm here merely for a
 rest-cure, no treatments. You can assign my quarters before continuing
 your—ah—discussion with the lady.""


 The clerk sputtered. Mrs. Jacobsen sputtered. But not for nothing was
 Harper one of the leading business executives of the earth. Harper's
 implacable stare won his point. Wiping beads of moisture from his
 forehead, the clerk fumbled for a card, typed it out, and was about to
 deposit it in the punch box when a fist hit the desk a resounding blow
 and another voice, male, roared out at Harper's elbow.


 ""This is a helluva joint!"" roared the voice. ""Man could rot away to the
 knees while he's waitin' for accommodations. Service!"" Again his fist
 banged the counter.


 The clerk jumped. He dropped Harper's card and had to stoop for it.
 Absently holding it, he straightened up to face Mrs. Jacobsen and the
 irate newcomer. Hastily he pushed a tagged key at Harper.


 ""Here you are, Mr. Breen. I'm sure you'll find it comfortable."" With a
 pallid smile he pressed a button and consigned Harper to the care of a
 silent and efficient robot.
The room was more than comfortable. It was beautiful. Its bank of clear
 windows set in the green glass wall framed startling rubicund views of
 the Martian hinterland where, Harper affectionately thought, fungi were
 busy producing enzymes that were going to be worth millions for him and
 his associates. There remained only the small detail of discovering how
 to extract them economically and to process them on this more than arid
 and almost airless planet. Details for his bright young laboratory men;
 mere details....


 Leaving his luggage to be unpacked by the robot attendant, he went up
 to the domed roof restaurant. Lunching boldly on broiled halibut with
 consomme, salad and a bland custard, he stared out at the dark blue
 sky of Mars, with Deimos hanging in the east in three-quarter phase
 while Phobos raced up from the west like a meteor behind schedule.
 Leaning back in his cushioned chair, he even more boldly lit a slim
 cigar—his first in months—and inhaled happily. For once old Scribney
 had certainly been right, he reflected. Yes sir, Scrib had rung the
 bell, and he wasn't the man to forget it. With a wonderful sense of
 well-being he returned to his room and prepared to relax.


 Harper opened his eyes. Two robots were bending over him. He saw that
 they were dressed in white, like hospital attendants. But he had no
 further opportunity to examine them. With brisk, well-co-ordinated
 movements they wheeled a stretcher along-side his couch, stuck a hypo
 into his arm, bundled him onto the stretcher and started wheeling him
 out.


 Harper's tongue finally functioned. ""What's all this?"" he demanded.
 ""There's nothing wrong with me. Let me go!""


 He struggled to rise, but a metal hand pushed him firmly on the chest.
 Inexorably it pushed him flat.


 ""You've got the wrong room!"" yelled Harp. ""Let me go!"" But the hypo
 began to take effect. His yells became weaker and drowsier. Hazily, as
 he drifted off, he thought of Mrs. Jacobsen. Maybe she had something,
 at that.
There was a tentative knock on the door. ""Come in,"" called Harper
 bleakly. As soon as the door opened he regretted his invitation, for
 the opening framed the large untidy man who had noisily pounded on the
 desk demanding service while he, Harp, was being registered.


 ""Say, pardner,"" he said hoarsely, ""you haven't seen any of them robots
 around here, have you?""


 Harper scowled. ""Oh, haven't I?"" he grated. ""Robots! Do you know what
 they did to me."" Indignation lit fires in his pale eyes. ""Came in here
 while I was lying down peacefully digesting the first meal I've enjoyed
 in months, dragged me off to the surgery, and pumped it all out! The
 only meal I've enjoyed in months!"" Blackly he sank his chin onto his
 fist and contemplated the outrage.


 ""Why didn't you stop 'em?"" reasonably asked the visitor.


 ""Stop a robot?"" Harper glared pityingly. ""How? You can't reason with
 the blasted things. And as for using force—it's man against metal. You
 try it!"" He ground his teeth together in futile rage. ""And to think I
 had the insane notion that robots were the last word! Why, I was ready
 to staff my offices with the things!""


 The big man placed his large hands on his own capacious stomach and
 groaned. ""I'm sure sorry it was you and not me, pardner. I could use
 some of that treatment right now. Musta been that steak and onions I
 ate after all that tundra dope I've been livin' on.""


 ""Tundra?"" A faint spark of alertness lightened Harper's dull rage. ""You
 mean you work out here on the tundra?""


 ""That's right. How'd you think I got in such a helluva shape? I'm
 superintendent of one of the fungus plants. I'm Jake Ellis of Hagerty's
 Enzymes. There's good money in it, but man, what a job! No air worth
 mentionin'. Temperature always freezin' or below. Pressure suits. Huts.
 Factory. Processed food. Nothin' else. Just nothin'. That's where they
 could use some robots. It sure ain't no job for a real live man. And in
 fact, there ain't many men left there. If old man Hagerty only knew it,
 he's about out of business.""


 Harper sat up as if he'd been needled. He opened his mouth to speak.
 But just then the door opened briskly and two robots entered. With a
 horrified stare, Harper clutched his maltreated stomach. He saw a third
 robot enter, wheeling a chair.


 ""A wheel chair!"" squeaked the victim. ""I tell you, there's nothing
 wrong with me! Take it away! I'm only here for a rest-cure! Believe me!
 Take it away!""


 The robots ignored him. For the first time in his spectacular and
 ruthless career Harper was up against creatures that he could neither
 bribe, persuade nor browbeat, inveigle nor ignore. It shattered his
 ebbing self-confidence. He began waving his hands helplessly.


 The robots not only ignored Harper. They paid no attention at all to
 Jake Ellis, who was plucking at their metallic arms pleading, ""Take
 me, boys. I need the treatment bad, whatever it is. I need all the
 treatment I can get. Take me! I'm just a wreck, fellers—""


 Stolidly they picked Harper up, plunked him into the chair, strapped
 him down and marched out with him.
Dejectedly Ellis returned to his own room. Again he lifted the receiver
 of the room phone; but as usual a robot voice answered sweetly,
 mechanically, and meaninglessly. He hung up and went miserably to bed.
There was something nagging at Harper's mind. Something he should do.
 Something that concerned robots. But he was too exhausted to think it
 out.


 For five days now his pet robots had put him through an ordeal that
 made him flinch every time he thought about it. Which wasn't often,
 since he was almost past thinking. They plunked him into stinking
 mud-baths and held him there until he was well-done to the bone, he
 was sure. They soaked him in foul, steaming irradiated waters until he
 gagged. They brought him weird concoctions to eat and drink and then
 stood over him until he consumed them. They purged and massaged and
 exercised him.


 Whenever they let him alone, he simply collapsed into bed and slept.
 There was nothing else to do anyway. They'd taken his clothes; and the
 phone, after an announcement that he would have no more service for two
 weeks, gave him nothing but a busy signal.


 ""Persecution, that's what it is!"" he moaned desperately. And he turned
 his back to the mirror, which showed him that he was beginning to look
 flesh-colored instead of the parchment yellow to which he had become
 accustomed. He closed his mind to the fact that he was sleeping for
 hours on end like the proverbial baby, and that he was getting such an
 appetite that he could almost relish even that detestable mush they
 sent him for breakfast. He was determined to be furious. As soon as he
 could wake up enough to be.


 He hadn't been awake long this time before Jake Ellis was there again,
 still moaning about his lack of treatments. ""Nothin' yet,"" he gloomily
 informed Harp. ""They haven't been near me. I just can't understand it.
 After I signed up for the works and paid 'em in advance! And I can't
 find any way out of this section. The other two rooms are empty and the
 elevator hasn't got any button. The robots just have to come and get a
 man or he's stuck.""


 ""Stuck!"" snarled Harp. ""I'm never stuck! And I'm damned if I'll wait
 any longer to break out of this—this jail! Listen, Jake. I've been
 thinking. Or trying to, with what's left of me. You came in just when
 that assinine clerk was registering me. I'll bet that clerk got rattled
 and gave me the wrong key. I'll bet you're supposed to have this room
 and I'm getting your treatments. Why don't we switch rooms and see what
 happens?""


 ""Say, maybe you're right!"" Jake's eyes gleamed at last with hope. ""I'll
 get my clothes.""


 Harp's eyebrows rose. ""You mean they left you your clothes?""


 ""Why, sure. You mean they took yours?""


 Harp nodded. An idea began to formulate. ""Leave your things, will you?
 I'm desperate! I'm going to see the manager of this madhouse if I have
 to go down dressed in a sheet. Your clothes would be better than that.""


 Jake, looking over Harper's skimpy frame, grunted doubtfully. ""Maybe
 you could tie 'em on so they wouldn't slip. And roll up the cuffs. It's
 okay with me, but just don't lose something when you're down there in
 that fancy lobby.""


 Harper looked at his watch. ""Time to go. Relax, old man. The robots
 will be along any minute now. If you're the only man in the room, I'm
 sure they'll take you. They aren't equipped to figure it out. And don't
 worry about me. I'll anchor your duds all right.""


 Harper had guessed right. Gleefully from the doorway of his new room
 he watched the robots wheel away his equally delighted neighbor for
 his first treatment. Then he closed the door and began to don Jake's
 clothing.


 The result was unique. He looked like a small boy in his father's
 clothes, except for the remarkably aged and gnome-like head sticking
 up on a skinny neck from a collar three sizes too big. And he was
 shoeless. He was completely unable to navigate in Jake's number
 twelves. But Harper was a determined man. He didn't even flinch from
 his image in the mirror. Firmly he stepped over to Jake's telephone.
 ""This is room 618,"" he said authoritatively. ""Send up the elevator for
 me. I want to go down to the lobby.""


 He'd guessed right again. ""It will be right up, sir,"" responded the
 robot operator. Hopefully he stepped out into the hall and shuffled to
 the elevator.
Only the robots were immune to Harper Breen's progress across the huge
 suave lobby.


 He was a blot on its rich beauty, a grotesque enigma that rooted the
 other visitors into paralyzed staring groups. Stepping out of the
 elevator, he had laid a course for the desk which loomed like an island
 in a moss-gray lake, and now he strode manfully toward it, ignoring the
 oversize trousers slapping around his stocking feet. Only the robots
 shared his self control.


 The clerk was the first to recover from the collective stupor.
 Frantically he pushed the button that would summon the robot guard.
 With a gasp of relief he saw the two massive manlike machines moving
 inexorably forward. He pointed to Harper. ""Get that patient!"" he
 ordered. ""Take him to the—to the mud-baths!""


 ""No you don't!"" yelled Harper. ""I want to see the manager!"" Nimbly he
 circled the guard and leaped behind the desk. He began to throw things
 at the robots. Things like inkwells and typewriters and card indexes.
 Especially, card indexes.


 ""Stop it!"" begged the clerk. ""You'll wreck the system! We'll never get
 it straight again! Stop it!""


 ""Call them off!"" snarled Harper. ""Call them off or I'll ruin your
 switchboard!"" He put a shoulder against it and prepared to heave.


 With one last appalled glare at the madman, the clerk picked up an
 electric finger and pointed it at the approaching robots. They became
 oddly inanimate.


 ""That's better!"" Harper straightened up and meticulously smoothed the
 collar of his flapping coat. ""Now—the manager, please.""


 ""This—this way, sir."" With shrinking steps the clerk led Harper across
 the width of the lobby among the fascinated guests. He was beyond
 speech. Opening the inconspicuous door, he waved Harper inside and
 returned doggedly to his desk, where he began to pick up things and at
 the same time phrase his resignation in his mind.


 Brushing aside the startled secretary in the outer cubicle, Harper
 flapped and shuffled straight into the inner sanctum. The manager, who
 was busy chewing a cigar to shreds behind his fortress of gun metal
 desk, jerked hastily upright and glared at the intruder. ""My good
 man—"" he began.


 ""Don't 'my-good-man' me!"" snapped Harper. He glared back at the
 manager. Reaching as far across the expanse of desktop as he could
 stretch, he shook his puny fist. ""Do you know who I am? I'm Harper
 S. Breen, of Breen and Helgart, Incorporated! And do you know why I
 haven't even a card to prove it? Do you know why I have to make my way
 downstairs in garb that makes a laughing stock of me? Do you know why?
 Because that assinine clerk of yours put me in the wrong room and those
 damnable robots of yours then proceeded to make a prisoner of me! Me,
 Harper S. Breen! Why, I'll sue you until you'll be lucky if you have a
 sheet of writing-paper left in this idiot's retreat!""


 Hayes, the manager, blanched. Then he began to mottle in an apoplectic
 pattern. And suddenly with a gusty sigh, he collapsed into his chair.
 With a shaking hand he mopped his forehead. ""
My
robots!"" he muttered.
 ""As if I invented the damned things!""


 Despondently he looked at Harper. ""Go ahead and sue, Mr. Breen. If you
 don't, somebody else will. And if nobody sues, we'll go broke anyway,
 at the rate our guest list is declining. I'm ready to hand in my
 resignation.""


 Again he sighed. ""The trouble,"" he explained, ""is that those fool
 robots are completely logical, and people aren't. There's no way to mix
 the two. It's dynamite. Maybe people can gradually learn to live with
 robots, but they haven't yet. Only we had to find it out the hard way.
 We—"" he grimaced disgustedly—""had to pioneer in the use of robots.
 And it cost us so much that we can't afford to reconvert to human help.
 So—Operation Robot is about to bankrupt the syndicate.""


 Listening, an amazing calm settled on Harper. Thoughtfully now he
 hooked a chair to the desk with his stockinged foot, sat down and
 reached for the cigar that Hayes automatically offered him. ""Oh, I
 don't know,"" he said mildly.


 Hayes leaned forward like a drowning man sighting a liferaft. ""What
 do you mean, you don't know? You're threatening to take our shirts,
 aren't you?""


 Meticulously Harper clipped and lit his cigar. ""It seems to me that
 these robots might be useful in quite another capacity. I might even
 make a deal with your syndicate to take them off your hands—at a
 reasonable price, of course—and forget the outrages I've suffered at
 your establishment.""


 Hayes leaned toward him incredulous. ""You mean you want these robots
 after what you've seen and experienced?""


 Placidly Harper puffed a smoke ring. ""Of course, you'd have to take
 into consideration that it would be an experiment for me, too. And
 there's the suit I'm clearly justified in instituting. However, I'm
 willing to discuss the matter with your superiors.""


 With hope burgeoning for the first time in weeks, Hayes lifted his
 head. ""My dear Mr. Breen, to get rid of these pestiferous robots, I'll
 back you to the hilt! I'll notify the owners at once. At once, Mr.
 Breen! And while we wait for them, allow me to put you up as a guest of
 the hotel."" Coming around to Harper, he effusively shook Harp's scrawny
 hand, and then personally escorted him not merely to the door but
 across the lobby to the elevator.


 Harper gazed out at the stunned audience. This was more like the
 treatment he was accustomed to! Haughtily he squared his bony shoulders
 inside the immense jacket and stepped into the elevator. He was ready
 for the second step of his private Operation Robot.
Back on Earth it was a warm, misty spring day—the kind of day unknown
 to the planet Mars. Bella and Scribney, superb in new spring outfits,
 waited restlessly while the rocket cooled and the passengers recovered
 from deceleration.


 ""Look, Scrib!"" Bella clutched Scribney's substantial arm. ""It's finally
 opening.""


 They watched the airlock open and the platform wheel into place. They
 watched the passengers descend, looking a trifle dazed.


 ""There he is!"" cried Bella. ""Why, doesn't he look wonderful! Scrib,
 it's amazing! Look at him!


 And indeed, Harper was stepping briskly downward, looking spry and fit
 and years younger. He came across to them actually beaming. It was the
 first pleasant expression they had seen on his face in years.


 ""Well, you old dog!"" exclaimed Scribney affectionately. ""So you did it
 again!""


 Harper smirked. ""Yep, I turned a neat little deal. I bought out
 Hagerty's Enzymes and staffed the plant with the hotel's robots. Got
 both of 'em dirt cheap. Both concerns going bankrupt because they
 didn't have sense enough to swap their workers. Feel I owe you a bit
 for that tip about enzymes, Scrib, so I made out a block of stock to
 you. All right?""


 ""All right?"" Scribney gulped. Why, the dried-up little turnip was human
 after all. ""All right! Yes, sir! But aren't you going to use some of
 those robots for office help? Aren't they efficient and all that?""


 Harper's smile vanished. ""Don't even mention such a thing!"" he yelped.
 ""You don't know what you're saying! I lived with those things for
 weeks. I wouldn't have one around! Keep 'em in the factory where they
 belong!""


 He glimpsed the composed, wonderfully human face of his secretary,
 waiting patiently in the background. ""Oh there you are, Smythe."" He
 turned to his relatives. ""Busy day ahead. See you later, folks—""


 ""Same old Harp,"" observed Scribney. Then he thought of the block of
 stock. ""What say we celebrate our rise to a position in the syndicate,
 honey?""


 ""Wonderful!"" She squeezed his arm, and smiling at each other, they left
 the port.

BY ROBERT E. McDOWELL


 Being space-wrecked and marooned is tough

 enough. But to face the horrors of such a

 planet as this was too much. Imagine Fawkes'

 terrible predicament; plenty of food—and

 twenty seven beautiful girls for companions.

Jonathan Fawkes opened his eyes. He was flat on his back, and a girl
 was bending over him. He detected a frightened expression on the
 girl's face. His pale blue eyes traveled upward beyond the girl. The
 sky was his roof, yet he distinctly remembered going to sleep on his
 bunk aboard the space ship.


 ""You're not dead?""


 ""I've some doubt about that,"" he replied dryly. He levered himself to
 his elbows. The girl, he saw, had bright yellow hair. Her nose was
 pert, tip-tilted. She had on a ragged blue frock and sandals.


 ""Is—is anything broken?"" she asked.


 ""Don't know. Help me up."" Between them he managed to struggle to his
 feet. He winced. He said, ""My name's Jonathan Fawkes. I'm a space pilot
 with Universal. What happened? I feel like I'd been poured out of a
 concrete mixer.""


 She pointed to the wreck of a small space freighter a dozen feet away.
 Its nose was buried in the turf, folded back like an accordion. It
 had burst open like a ripe watermelon. He was surprised that he had
 survived at all. He scratched his head. ""I was running from Mars to
 Jupiter with a load of seed for the colonists.""


 ""Oh!"" said the girl, biting her lips. ""Your co-pilot must be in the
 wreckage.""


 He shook his head. ""No,"" he reassured her. ""I left him on Mars. He
 had an attack of space sickness. I was all by myself; that was the
 trouble. I'd stay at the controls as long as I could, then lock her on
 her course and snatch a couple of hours' sleep. I can remember crawling
 into my bunk. The next thing I knew you were bending over me."" He
 paused. ""I guess the automatic deflectors slowed me up or I would have
 been a cinder by this time,"" he said.


 The girl didn't reply. She continued to watch him, a faint enigmatic
 smile on her lips. Jonathan glanced away in embarrassment. He wished
 that pretty women didn't upset him so. He said nervously, ""Where am I?
 I couldn't have slept all the way to Jupiter.""


 The girl shrugged her shoulders.


 ""I don't know.""


 ""You don't know!"" He almost forgot his self-consciousness in his
 surprise. His pale blue eyes returned to the landscape. A mile across
 the plain began a range of jagged foothills, which tossed upward
 higher and higher until they merged with the blue saw-edge of a chain
 of mountains. As he looked a puff of smoke belched from a truncated
 cone-shaped peak. A volcano. Otherwise there was no sign of life: just
 he and the strange yellow-headed girl alone in the center of that vast
 rolling prairie.


 ""I was going to explain,"" he heard her say. ""We think that we are on an
 asteroid.""


 ""We?"" he looked back at her.


 ""Yes. There are twenty-seven of us. We were on our way to Jupiter, too,
 only we were going to be wives for the colonists.""


 ""I remember,"" he exclaimed. ""Didn't the Jupiter Food-growers
 Association enlist you girls to go to the colonies?""


 She nodded her head. ""Only twenty-seven of us came through the crash.""


 ""Everybody thought your space ship hit a meteor,"" he said.


 ""We hit this asteroid.""


 ""But that was three years ago.""


 ""Has it been that long? We lost track of time."" She didn't take her
 eyes off him, not for a second. Such attention made him acutely self
 conscious. She said, ""I'm Ann. Ann Clotilde. I was hunting when I saw
 your space ship. You had been thrown clear. You were lying all in a
 heap. I thought you were dead."" She stooped, picked up a spear.


 ""Do you feel strong enough to hike back to our camp? It's only about
 four miles,"" she said.


 ""I think so,"" he said.
Jonathan Fawkes fidgeted uncomfortably. He would rather pilot a space
 ship through a meteor field than face twenty-seven young women. They
 were the only thing in the Spaceways of which he was in awe. Then he
 realized that the girl's dark blue eyes had strayed beyond him. A frown
 of concentration marred her regular features. He turned around.


 On the rim of the prairie he saw a dozen black specks moving toward
 them.


 She said: ""Get down!"" Her voice was agitated. She flung herself on her
 stomach and began to crawl away from the wreck. Jonathan Fawkes stared
 after her stupidly. ""Get down!"" she reiterated in a furious voice.


 He let himself to his hands and knees. ""Ouch!"" he said. He felt like
 he was being jabbed with pins. He must be one big bruise. He scuttled
 after the girl. ""What's wrong?""


 The girl looked back at him over her shoulder. ""Centaurs!"" she said. ""I
 didn't know they had returned. There is a small ravine just ahead which
 leads into the hills. I don't think they've seen us. If we can reach
 the hills we'll be safe.""


 ""Centaurs! Isn't there anything new under the sun?""


 ""Well, personally,"" she replied, ""I never saw a Centaur until I was
 wrecked on this asteroid."" She reached the ravine, crawled head
 foremost over the edge. Jonathan tumbled after her. He hit the bottom,
 winced, scrambled to his feet. The girl started at a trot for the
 hills. Jonathan, groaning at each step, hobbled beside her.


 ""Why won't the Centaurs follow us into the hills?"" he panted.


 ""Too rough. They're like horses,"" she said. ""Nothing but a goat could
 get around in the hills.""


 The gulley, he saw, was deepening into a respectable canyon, then a
 gorge. In half a mile, the walls towered above them. A narrow ribbon
 of sky was visible overhead. Yellow fern-like plants sprouted from the
 crevices and floor of the canyon.


 They flushed a small furry creature from behind a bush. As it sped
 away, it resembled a cottontail of Earth. The girl whipped back her
 arm, flung the spear. It transfixed the rodent. She picked it up, tied
 it to her waist. Jonathan gaped. Such strength and accuracy astounded
 him. He thought, amazons and centaurs. He thought, but this is the year
 3372; not the time of ancient Greece.


 The canyon bore to the left. It grew rougher, the walls more
 precipitate. Jonathan limped to a halt. High boots and breeches, the
 uniform of Universal's space pilots, hadn't been designed for walking.
 ""Hold on,"" he said. He felt in his pockets, withdrew an empty cigarette
 package, crumpled it and hurled it to the ground.


 ""You got a cigarette?"" he asked without much hope.


 The girl shook her head. ""We ran out of tobacco the first few months we
 were here.""


 Jonathan turned around, started back for the space ship.


 ""Where are you going?"" cried Ann in alarm.


 He said, ""I've got a couple of cartons of cigarettes back at the
 freighter. Centaurs or no centaurs, I'm going to get a smoke.""


 ""No!"" She clutched his arm. He was surprised at the strength of her
 grip. ""They'd kill you,"" she said.


 ""I can sneak back,"" he insisted stubbornly. ""They might loot the ship.
 I don't want to lose those cigarettes. I was hauling some good burley
 tobacco seed too. The colonists were going to experiment with it on
 Ganymede.""


 ""No!""


 He lifted his eyebrows. He thought, she is an amazon! He firmly
 detached her hand.


 The girl flicked up her spear, nicked his neck with the point of it.
 ""We are going to the camp,"" she said.


 Jonathan threw himself down backwards, kicked the girl's feet out from
 under her. Like a cat he scrambled up and wrenched the spear away.


 A voice shouted: ""What's going on there?""
He paused shamefacedly. A second girl, he saw, was running toward
 them from up the canyon. Her bare legs flashed like ivory. She was
 barefooted, and she had black hair. A green cloth was wrapped around
 her sarong fashion. She bounced to a stop in front of Jonathan, her
 brown eyes wide in surprise. He thought her sarong had been a table
 cloth at one time in its history.


 ""A man!"" she breathed. ""By Jupiter and all its little moons, it's a
 man!""


 ""Don't let him get away!"" cried Ann.


 ""Hilda!"" the brunette shrieked. ""A man! It's a man!""


 A third girl skidded around the bend in the canyon. Jonathan backed off
 warily.


 Ann Clotilde cried in anguish: ""Don't let him get away!""


 Jonathan chose the centaurs. He wheeled around, dashed back the way
 he had come. Someone tackled him. He rolled on the rocky floor of the
 canyon. He struggled to his feet. He saw six more girls race around the
 bend in the canyon. With shouts of joy they flung themselves on him.


 Jonathan was game, but the nine husky amazons pinned him down by sheer
 weight. They bound him hand and foot. Then four of them picked him up
 bodily, started up the canyon chanting: ""
He was a rocket riding daddy
 from Mars.
"" He recognized it as a popular song of three years ago.


 Jonathan had never been so humiliated in his life. He was known in the
 spaceways from Mercury to Jupiter as a man to leave alone. His nose had
 been broken three times. A thin white scar crawled down the bronze of
 his left cheek, relic of a barroom brawl on Venus. He was big, rangy,
 tough. And these girls had trounced him. Girls! He almost wept from
 mortification.


 He said, ""Put me down. I'll walk.""


 ""You won't try to get away?"" said Ann.


 ""No,"" he replied with as much dignity as he could summon while being
 held aloft by four barbarous young women.


 ""Let him down,"" said Ann. ""We can catch him, anyway, if he makes a
 break.""


 Jonathan Fawkes' humiliation was complete. He meekly trudged between
 two husky females, who ogled him shamelessly. He was amazed at the ease
 with which they had carried him. He was six feet three and no light
 weight. He thought enviously of the centaurs, free to gallop across the
 plains. He wished he was a centaur.


 The trail left the canyon, struggled up the precipitate walls. Jonathan
 picked his way gingerly, hugged the rock. ""Don't be afraid,"" advised
 one of his captors. ""Just don't look down.""


 ""I'm not afraid,"" said Jonathan hotly. To prove it he trod the narrow
 ledge with scorn. His foot struck a pebble. Both feet went out from
 under him. He slithered halfway over the edge. For one sickening moment
 he thought he was gone, then Ann grabbed him by the scruff of his neck,
 hauled him back to safety. He lay gasping on his stomach. They tied a
 rope around his waist then, and led him the rest of the way to the top
 like a baby on a leash. He was too crestfallen to resent it.


 The trail came out on a high ridge. They paused on a bluff overlooking
 the prairie.


 ""Look!"" cried Ann pointing over the edge.


 A half dozen beasts were trotting beneath on the plain. At first,
 Jonathan mistook them for horses. Then he saw that from the withers up
 they resembled men. Waists, shoulders, arms and heads were identical to
 his own, but their bodies were the bodies of horses.


 ""Centaurs!"" Jonathan Fawkes said, not believing his eyes.
The girls set up a shout and threw stones down at the centaurs, who
 reared, pawed the air, and galloped to a safe distance, from which they
 hurled back insults in a strange tongue. Their voices sounded faintly
 like the neighing of horses.


 Amazons and centaurs, he thought again. He couldn't get the problem
 of the girls' phenomenal strength out of his mind. Then it occurred
 to him that the asteroid, most likely, was smaller even than Earth's
 moon. He must weigh about a thirtieth of what he usually did, due to
 the lessened gravity. It also occurred to him that they would be thirty
 times as strong. He was staggered. He wished he had a smoke.


 At length, the amazons and the centaurs tired of bandying insults
 back and forth. The centaurs galloped off into the prairie, the girls
 resumed their march. Jonathan scrambled up hills, skidded down slopes.
 The brunette was beside him helping him over the rough spots.


 ""I'm Olga,"" she confided. ""Has anybody ever told you what a handsome
 fellow you are?"" She pinched his cheek. Jonathan blushed.


 They climbed a ridge, paused at the crest. Below them, he saw a deep
 valley. A stream tumbled through the center of it. There were trees
 along its banks, the first he had seen on the asteroid. At the head of
 the valley, he made out the massive pile of a space liner.


 They started down a winding path. The space liner disappeared behind
 a promontory of the mountain. Jonathan steeled himself for the coming
 ordeal. He would have sat down and refused to budge except that he knew
 the girls would hoist him on their shoulders and bear him into the camp
 like a bag of meal.


 The trail debouched into the valley. Just ahead the space liner
 reappeared. He imagined that it had crashed into the mountain, skidded
 and rolled down its side until it lodged beside the stream. It reminded
 him of a wounded dinosaur. Three girls were bathing in the stream. He
 looked away hastily.


 Someone hailed them from the space ship.


 ""We've caught a man,"" shrieked one of his captors.


 A flock of girls streamed out of the wrecked space ship.


 ""A man!"" screamed a husky blonde. She was wearing a grass skirt. She
 had green eyes. ""We're rescued!""


 ""No. No,"" Ann Clotilde hastened to explain. ""He was wrecked like us.""


 ""Oh,"" came a disappointed chorus.


 ""He's a man,"" said the green-eyed blonde. ""That's the next best thing.""


 ""Oh, Olga,"" said a strapping brunette. ""Who'd ever thought a man could
 look so good?""


 ""I did,"" said Olga. She chucked Jonathan under the chin. He shivered
 like an unbroken colt when the bit first goes in its mouth. He felt
 like a mouse hemmed in by a ring of cats.


 A big rawboned brute of a girl strolled into the circle. She said,
 ""Dinner's ready."" Her voice was loud, strident. It reminded him of
 the voices of girls in the honky tonks on Venus. She looked at him
 appraisingly as if he were a horse she was about to bid on. ""Bring him
 into the ship,"" she said. ""The man must be starved.""


 He was propelled jubilantly into the palatial dining salon of the
 wrecked liner. A long polished meturilium table occupied the center of
 the floor. Automatic weight distributing chairs stood around it. His
 feet sank into a green fiberon carpet. He had stepped back into the
 Thirty-fourth Century from the fabulous barbarian past.


 With a sigh of relief, he started to sit down. A lithe red-head sprang
 forward and held his chair. They all waited politely for him to be
 seated before they took their places. He felt silly. He felt like
 a captive princess. All the confidence engendered by the familiar
 settings of the space ship went out of him like wind. He, Jonathan
 Fawkes, was a castaway on an asteroid inhabited by twenty-seven wild
 women.
As the meal boisterously progressed, he regained sufficient courage
 to glance timidly around. Directly across the table sat a striking,
 grey-eyed girl whose brown hair was coiled severely about her head. She
 looked to him like a stenographer. He watched horrified as she seized
 a whole roast fowl, tore it apart with her fingers, gnawed a leg. She
 caught him staring at her and rolled her eyes at him. He returned his
 gaze to his plate.


 Olga said: ""Hey, Sultan.""


 He shuddered, but looked up questioningly.


 She said, ""How's the fish?""


 ""Good,"" he mumbled between a mouthful. ""Where did you get it?""


 ""Caught it,"" said Olga. ""The stream's full of 'em. I'll take you
 fishing tomorrow."" She winked at him so brazenly that he choked on a
 bone.


 ""Heaven forbid,"" he said.


 ""How about coming with me to gather fruit?"" cried the green-eyed
 blonde; ""you great big handsome man.""


 ""Or me?"" cried another. And the table was in an uproar.


 The rawboned woman who had summoned them to dinner, pounded the table
 until the cups and plates danced. Jonathan had gathered that she was
 called Billy.


 ""Quiet!"" She shrieked in her loud strident voice. ""Let him be. He can't
 go anywhere for a few days. He's just been through a wreck. He needs
 rest."" She turned to Jonathan who had shrunk down in his chair. ""How
 about some roast?"" she said.


 ""No."" He pushed back his plate with a sigh. ""If I only had a smoke.""


 Olga gave her unruly black hair a flirt. ""Isn't that just like a man?""


 ""I wouldn't know,"" said the green-eyed blonde. ""I've forgotten what
 they're like.""


 Billy said, ""How badly wrecked is your ship?""


 ""It's strewn all over the landscape,"" he replied sleepily.


 ""Is there any chance of patching it up?""


 He considered the question. More than anything else, he decided, he
 wanted to sleep. ""What?"" he said.


 ""Is there any possibility of repairing your ship?"" repeated Billy.


 ""Not outside the space docks.""


 They expelled their breath, but not for an instant did they relax
 the barrage of their eyes. He shifted position in embarrassment. The
 movement pulled his muscles like a rack. Furthermore, an overpowering
 lassitude was threatening to pop him off to sleep before their eyes.


 ""You look exhausted,"" said Ann.


 Jonathan dragged himself back from the edge of sleep. ""Just tired,"" he
 mumbled. ""Haven't had a good night's rest since I left Mars."" Indeed
 it was only by the most painful effort that he kept awake at all. His
 eyelids drooped lower and lower.


 ""First it's tobacco,"" said Olga; ""now he wants to sleep. Twenty-seven
 girls and he wants to sleep.""


 ""He is asleep,"" said the green-eyed blonde.
Jonathan was slumped forward across the table, his head buried in his
 arms.


 ""Catch a hold,"" said Billy, pushing back from the table. A dozen girls
 volunteered with a rush. ""Hoist!"" said Billy. They lifted him like a
 sleepy child, bore him tenderly up an incline and into a stateroom,
 where they deposited him on the bed.


 Ann said to Olga; ""Help me with these boots."" But they resisted every
 tug. ""It's no use,"" groaned Ann, straightening up and wiping her bright
 yellow hair back from her eyes. ""His feet have swollen. We'll have to
 cut them off.""


 At these words, Jonathan raised upright as if someone had pulled a rope.


 ""
Cut off whose feet?
"" he cried in alarm.


 ""Not your feet, silly,"" said Ann. ""Your boots.""


 ""Lay a hand on those boots,"" he scowled; ""and I'll make me another pair
 out of your hides. They set me back a week's salary."" Having delivered
 himself of this ultimatum, he went back to sleep.


 Olga clapped her hand to her forehead. ""And this,"" she cried ""is what
 we've been praying for during the last three years.""


 The next day found Jonathan Fawkes hobbling around by the aid of a
 cane. At the portal of the space ship, he stuck out his head, glanced
 all around warily. None of the girls were in sight. They had, he
 presumed, gone about their chores: hunting, fishing, gathering fruits
 and berries. He emerged all the way and set out for the creek. He
 walked with an exaggerated limp just in case any of them should be
 hanging around. As long as he was an invalid he was safe, he hoped.


 He sighed. Not every man could be waited on so solicitously by
 twenty-seven handsome strapping amazons. He wished he could carry it
 off in cavalier fashion. He hobbled to the creek, sat down beneath the
 shade of a tree. He just wasn't the type, he supposed. And it might be
 years before they were rescued.


 As a last resort, he supposed, he could hide out in the hills or join
 the centaurs. He rather fancied himself galloping across the plains
 on the back of a centaur. He looked up with a start. Ann Clotilde was
 ambling toward him.


 ""How's the invalid?"" she said, seating herself beside him.


 ""Hot, isn't it?"" he said. He started to rise. Ann Clotilde placed the
 flat of her hand on his chest and shoved. ""
Ooof!
"" he grunted. He sat
 down rather more forcibly than he had risen.


 ""Don't get up because of me,"" she informed him. ""It's my turn to cook,
 but I saw you out here beneath the trees. Dinner can wait. Jonathan do
 you know that you are irresistible?"" She seized his shoulders, stared
 into his eyes. He couldn't have felt any more uncomfortable had a
 hungry boa constrictor draped itself in his arms. He mopped his brow
 with his sleeve.


 ""Suppose the rest should come,"" he said in an embarrassed voice.


 ""They're busy. They won't be here until I call them to lunch. Your
 eyes,"" she said, ""are like deep mysterious pools.""


 ""Sure enough?"" said Jonathan with involuntary interest. He began to
 recover his nerve.


 She said, ""You're the best looking thing."" She rumpled his hair. ""I
 can't keep my eyes off you.""


 Jonathan put his arm around her gingerly. ""Ouch!"" He winced. He had
 forgotten his sore muscles.


 ""I forgot,"" said Ann Clotilde in a contrite voice. She tried to rise.
 ""You're hurt.""


 He pulled her back down. ""Not so you could notice it,"" he grinned.


 ""Well!"" came the strident voice of Billy from behind them. ""We're
all
glad to hear that!""
Jonathan leaped to his feet, dumping Ann to the ground. He jerked
 around. All twenty-six of the girls were lined up on the path. Their
 features were grim. He said: ""I don't feel so well after all.""


 ""It don't wash,"" said Billy. ""It's time for a showdown.""


 Jonathan's hair stood on end. He felt rather than saw Ann Clotilde take
 her stand beside him. He noticed that she was holding her spear at a
 menacing angle. She said in an angry voice: ""He's mine. I found him.
 Leave him alone.""


 ""Where do you get that stuff?"" cried Olga. ""Share and share alike, say
 I.""


 ""We could draw straws for him,"" suggested the green-eyed blonde.


 ""Look here,"" Jonathan broke in. ""I've got some say in the matter.""


 ""You have not,"" snapped Billy. ""You'll do just as we say."" She took a
 step toward him.


 Jonathan edged away in consternation.


 ""He's going to run!"" Olga shouted.


 Jonathan never stopped until he was back in the canyon leading to the
 plain. His nerves were jumping like fleas. He craved the soothing
 relaxation of a smoke. There was, he remembered, a carton of cigarettes
 at the wreck. He resumed his flight, but at a more sober pace.


 At the spot where he and Ann had first crawled away from the centaurs,
 he scrambled out of the gulley, glanced in the direction of his space
 ship. He blinked his eyes, stared. Then he waved his arms, shouted and
 tore across the prairie. A trim space cruiser was resting beside the
 wreck of his own. Across its gleaming monaloid hull ran an inscription
 in silver letters: ""INTERSTELLAR COSMOGRAPHY SOCIETY.""


 Two men crawled out of Jonathan's wrecked freighter, glanced in
 surprise at Jonathan. A third man ran from the cruiser, a Dixon Ray
 Rifle in his hand.


 ""I'm Jonathan Fawkes,"" said the castaway as he panted up, ""pilot for
 Universal. I was wrecked.""


 A tall elderly man held out his hand. He had a small black waxed
 mustache and Van Dyke. He was smoking a venusian cigarette in a
 yellow composition holder. He said, ""I'm Doctor Boynton."" He had a
 rich cultivated voice, and a nose like a hawk. ""We are members of the
 Interstellar Cosmography Society. We've been commissioned to make a
 cursory examination of this asteroid. You had a nasty crack up, Mr.
 Fawkes. But you are in luck, sir. We were on the point of returning
 when we sighted the wreck.""


 ""I say,"" said the man who had run out of the cruiser. He was a prim,
 energetic young man. Jonathan noted that he carried the ray gun
 gingerly, respectfully. ""We're a week overdue now,"" he said. ""If you
 have any personal belongings that you'd like to take with you, you'd
 best be getting them aboard.""
Jonathan's face broke into a grin. He said, ""Do any of you know how to
 grow tobacco?""


 They glanced at each other in perplexity.


 ""I like it here,"" continued Jonathan. ""I'm not going back.""


 ""What?"" cried the three explorers in one breath.


 ""I'm going to stay,"" he repeated. ""I only came back here after the
 cigarettes.""


 ""But it will be three years before the asteroid's orbit brings it back
 in the space lanes,"" said Doctor Boynton. ""You don't possibly expect to
 be picked up before then!""


 Jonathan shook his head, began to load himself with tools, tobacco
 seed, and cigarettes.


 ""Odd."" Doctor Boynton shook his head, turned to the others. ""Though if
 I remember correctly, there was quite an epidemic of hermits during
 the medieval period. It was an esthetic movement. They fled to the
 wilderness to escape the temptation of
women
.""


 Jonathan laughed outright.


 ""You are sure you won't return, young man?""


 He shook his head. They argued, they cajoled, but Jonathan was adamant.
 He said, ""You might report my accident to Universal. Tell them to stop
 one of their Jupiter-bound freighters here when the asteroid swings
 back in the space ways. I'll have a load for them.""


 Inside the ship, Doctor Boynton moved over to a round transparent port
 hole. ""What a strange fellow,"" he murmured. He was just in time to see
 the castaway, loaded like a pack mule, disappear in the direction from
 which he had come.


 Robinson Crusoe was going back to his man (?) Friday—all twenty-seven
 of them.

By POUL ANDERSON
Behind a pale Venusian mask lay hidden the
 
arch-humanist, the anti-tech killer ... one of
 
those who needlessly had strewn Malone blood
 
across the heavens from Saturn to the sun.
 
Now—on distant Trojan asteroids—the
 
rendezvous for death was plainly marked.

The most dangerous is not the outlawed murderer, who only slays men,
 but the rebellious philosopher: for he destroys worlds.


 Darkness and the chill glitter of stars. Bo Jonsson crouched on a
 whirling speck of stone and waited for the man who was coming to kill
 him.


 There was no horizon. The flying mountain on which he stood was
 too small. At his back rose a cliff of jagged rock, losing its own
 blackness in the loom of shadows; its teeth ate raggedly across the
 Milky Way. Before him, a tumbled igneous wilderness slanted crazily
 off, with one long thin crag sticking into the sky like a grotesque
 bowsprit.


 There was no sound except the thudding of his own heart, the harsh rasp
 of his own breath, locked inside the stinking metal skin of his suit.
 Otherwise ... no air, no heat, no water or life or work of man, only a
 granite nakedness spinning through space out beyond Mars.


 Stooping, awkward in the clumsy armor, he put the transparent plastic
 of his helmet to the ground. Its cold bit at him even through the
 insulating material. He might be able to hear the footsteps of his
 murderer conducted through the ground.


 Stillness answered him. He gulped a heavy lungful of tainted air
 and rose. The other might be miles away yet, or perhaps very close,
 catfooting too softly to set up vibrations. A man could do that when
 gravity was feeble enough.


 The stars blazed with a cruel wintry brilliance, over him, around
 him, light-years to fall through emptiness before he reached one. He
 had been alone among them before; he had almost thought them friends.
 Sometimes, on a long watch, a man found himself talking to Vega or
 Spica or dear old Beetle Juice, murmuring what was in him as if the
 remote sun could understand. But they didn't care, he saw that now. To
 them, he did not exist, and they would shine carelessly long after he
 was gone into night.


 He had never felt so alone as now, when another man was on the asteroid
 with him, hunting him down.


 Bo Jonsson looked at the wrench in his hand. It was long and massive,
 it would have been heavy on Earth, but it was hardly enough to unscrew
 the stars and reset the machinery of a universe gone awry. He smiled
 stiffly at the thought. He wanted to laugh too, but checked himself for
 fear he wouldn't be able to stop.
Let's face it
, he told himself.
You're scared. You're scared
 sweatless.
He wondered if he had spoken it aloud.


 There was plenty of room on the asteroid. At least two hundred square
 miles, probably more if you allowed for the rough surface. He could
 skulk around, hide ... and suffocate when his tanked air gave out. He
 had to be a hunter, too, and track down the other man, before he died.
 And if he found his enemy, he would probably die anyway.


 He looked about him. Nothing. No sound, no movement, nothing but the
 streaming of the constellations as the asteroid spun. Nothing had ever
 moved here, since the beginning of time when moltenness congealed into
 death. Not till men came and hunted each other.


 Slowly he forced himself to move. The thrust of his foot sent him
 up, looping over the cliff to drift down like a dead leaf in Earth's
 October. Suit, equipment, and his own body, all together, weighed only
 a couple of pounds here. It was ghostly, this soundless progress over
 fields which had never known life. It was like being dead already.


 Bo Jonsson's tongue was dry and thick in his mouth. He wanted to
 find his enemy and give up, buy existence at whatever price it would
 command. But he couldn't do that. Even if the other man let him do it,
 which was doubtful, he couldn't. Johnny Malone was dead.


 Maybe that was what had started it all—the death of Johnny Malone.
There are numerous reasons for basing on the Trojan asteroids, but
 the main one can be given in a single word: stability. They stay put
 in Jupiter's orbit, about sixty degrees ahead and behind, with only
 minor oscillations; spaceships need not waste fuel coming up to a body
 which has been perturbed a goodly distance from where it was supposed
 to be. The trailing group is the jumping-off place for trans-Jovian
 planets, the leading group for the inner worlds—that way, their own
 revolution about the sun gives the departing ship a welcome boost,
 while minimizing the effects of Jupiter's drag.


 Moreover, being dense clusters, they have attracted swarms of miners,
 so that Achilles among the leaders and Patroclus in the trailers have a
 permanent boom town atmosphere. Even though a spaceship and equipment
 represent a large investment, this is one of the last strongholds of
 genuinely private enterprise: the prospector, the mine owner, the
 rockhound dreaming of the day when his stake is big enough for him to
 start out on his own—a race of individualists, rough and noisy and
 jealous, but living under iron rules of hospitality and rescue.


 The Last Chance on Achilles has another name, which simply sticks an
 ""r"" in the official one; even for that planetoid, it is a rowdy bar
 where Guardsmen come in trios. But Johnny Malone liked it, and talked
 Bo Jonsson into going there for a final spree before checkoff and
 departure. ""Nothing to compare,"" he insisted. ""Every place else is
 getting too fantangling civilized, except Venus, and I don't enjoy
 Venus.""


 Johnny was from Luna City himself: a small, dark man with the quick
 nervous movements and dipped accent of that roaring commercial
 metropolis. He affected the latest styles, brilliant colors in the
 flowing tunic and slacks, a beret cocked on his sleek head. But somehow
 he didn't grate on Bo, they had been partners for several years now.


 They pushed through a milling crowd at the bar, rockhounds who watched
 one of Achilles' three live ecdysiasts with hungry eyes, and by some
 miracle found an empty booth. Bo squeezed his bulk into one side of the
 cubicle while Johnny, squinting through a reeking smoke-haze, dialed
 drinks. Bo was larger and heavier than most spacemen—he'd never have
 gotten his certificate before the ion drive came in—and was usually
 content to let others talk while he listened. A placid blond giant,
 with amiable blue eyes in a battered brown face, he did not consider
 himself bright, and always wanted to learn.


 Johnny gulped his drink and winced. ""Whiskey, they call it yet! Water,
 synthetic alcohol, and a dash of caramel they have the gall to label
 whiskey and charge for!""


 ""Everything's expensive here,"" said Bo mildly. ""That's why so few
 rockhounds get rich. They make a lot of money, but they have to spend
 it just as fast to stay alive.""


 ""Yeh ... yeh ... wish they'd spend some of it on us."" Johnny grinned
 and fed the dispenser another coin. It muttered to itself and slid
 forth a tray with a glass. ""C'mon, drink up, man. It's a long way home,
 and we've got to fortify ourselves for the trip. A bottle, a battle,
 and a wench is what I need. Most especially the wench, because I don't
 think the eminent Dr. McKittrick is gonna be interested in sociability,
 and it's close quarters aboard the
Dog
.""


 Bo kept on sipping slowly. ""Johnny,"" he said, raising his voice to cut
 through the din, ""you're an educated man. I never could figure out why
 you want to talk like a jumper.""


 ""Because I am one at heart. Look, Bo, why don't you get over that
 inferiority complex of yours? A man can't run a spaceship without
 knowing more math and physical science than the average professor on
 Earth. So you had to work your way through the Academy and never had a
 chance to fan yourself with a lily white hand while somebody tootled
 Mozart through a horn. So what?"" Johnny's head darted around, birdlike.
 ""If we want some women we'd better make our reservations now.""


 ""I don't, Johnny,"" said Bo. ""I'll just nurse a beer."" It wasn't morals
 so much as fastidiousness; he'd wait till they hit Luna.


 ""Suit yourself. If you don't want to uphold the honor of the Sirius
 Transportation Company—""


 Bo chuckled. The Company consisted of (a) the
Sirius
; (b) her crew,
 himself and Johnny; (c) a warehouse, berth, and three other part owners
 back in Luna City. Not exactly a tramp ship, because you can't normally
 stop in the middle of an interplanetary voyage and head for somewhere
 else; but she went wherever there was cargo or people to be moved.
 Her margin of profit was not great in spite of the charges, for a
 space trip is expensive; but in a few more years they'd be able to buy
 another ship or two, and eventually Fireball and Triplanetary would be
 getting some competition. Even the public lines might have to worry a
 little.


 Johnny put away another couple of shots and rose. Alcohol cost plenty,
 but it was also more effective in low-gee. ""'Scuse me,"" he said. ""I see
 a target. Sure you don't want me to ask if she has a friend?""


 Bo shook his head and watched his partner move off, swift in the puny
 gravity—the Last Chance didn't centrifuge like some of the tommicker
 places downtown. It was hard to push through the crowd without weight
 to help, but Johnny faded along and edged up to the girl with his
 highest-powered smile. There were several other men standing around
 her, but Johnny had The Touch. He'd be bringing her back here in a few
 minutes.


 Bo sighed, feeling a bit lonesome. If he wasn't going to make a night
 of it, there was no point in drinking heavily. He had to make the final
 inspection of the ship tomorrow, and grudged the cost of anti-hangover
 tablets. Besides what he was putting back into the business, he was
 trying to build a private hoard; some day, he'd retire and get married
 and build a house. He already had the site picked out, on Kullen
 overlooking the Sound, back on Earth. Man, but it was a long time since
 he'd been on Earth!


 A sharp noise slashed through the haze of talk and music Bo looked up.
 There was a tall black haired man, Venusian to judge by his kilts,
 arguing with Johnny. His face was ugly with anger.


 Johnny made some reply. Bo heaved up his form and strode toward the
 discussion, casually picking up anyone in the way and setting him
 aside. Johnny liked a fight, but this Venusian was big.


 As he neared, he caught words: ""—my girl, dammit.""


 ""Like hell I am!"" said the girl. ""I never saw you before—""


 ""Run along and play, son,"" said Johnny. ""Or do you want me to change
 that diaper of yours?""


 That was when it happened. Bo saw the little needler spit from the
 Venusian's fingers. Johnny stood there a moment, looking foolishly at
 the dart in his stomach. Then his knees buckled and he fell with a
 nightmare slowness.


 The Venusian was already on the move. He sprang straight up, slammed a
 kick at the wall, and arced out the door into the dome corridor beyond.
A spaceman, that. Knows how to handle himself in low-gee.
It was the
 only clear thought which ran in the sudden storm of Bo's head.


 The girl screamed. A man cursed and tried to follow the Venusian.
 He tangled with another. ""Get outta my way!"" A roar lifted, someone
 slugged, someone else coolly smashed a bottle against the bar and
 lifted the jagged end. There was the noise of a fist meeting flesh.


 Bo had seen death before. That needle wasn't anesthetic, it was poison.
 He knelt in the riot with Johnny's body in his arms.
II


 Suddenly the world came to an end. There was a sheer drop-off onto the
 next face of the rough cube which was the asteroid. Bo lay on his belly
 and peered down the cliff, it ran for a couple of miles and beyond it
 were the deeps of space and the cold stars. He could dimly see the
 tortured swirl of crystallization patterns in the smooth bareness. No
 place to hide; his enemy was not there.


 He turned the thought over in a mind which seemed stiff and slow. By
 crossing that little plain he was exposing himself to a shot from one
 of its edges. On the other hand, he could just as well be bushwhacked
 from a ravine as he jumped over. And this route was the fastest for
 completing his search scheme.


 The Great Bear slid into sight, down under the world as it turned. He
 had often stood on winter nights, back in Sweden, and seen its immense
 sprawl across the weird flicker of aurora; but even then he wanted the
 spaceman's experience of seeing it from above. Well, now he had his
 wish, and much good it had done him.


 He went over the edge of the cliff, cautiously, for it wouldn't take
 much of an impetus to throw him off this rock entirely. Then his
 helpless and soon frozen body would be just another meteor for the next
 million years. The vague downward sensation of gravity shifted insanely
 as he moved; he had the feeling that the world was tilting around him.
 Now it was the precipice which was a scarred black plain underfoot,
 reaching to a saw-toothed bluff at its farther edge.


 He moved with flat low-gee bounds. Besides the danger of springing off
 the asteroid entirely, there was its low acceleration to keep a man
 near the ground; jump up a few feet and it would take you a while to
 fall back. It was utterly silent around him. He had never thought there
 could be so much stillness.


 He was halfway across when the bullet came. He saw no flash, heard
 no crack, but suddenly the fissured land before him exploded in a
 soundless shower of chips. The bullet ricocheted flatly, heading off
 for outer space. No meteor gravel, that!


 Bo stood unmoving an instant, fighting the impulse to leap away. He was
 a spaceman, not a rockhound; he wasn't used to this environment, and if
 he jumped high he could be riddled as he fell slowly down again. Sweat
 was cold on his body. He squinted, trying to see where the shot had
 come from.


 Suddenly he was zigzagging off across the plain toward the nearest
 edge. Another bullet pocked the ground near him. The sun rose, a tiny
 heatless dazzle blinding in his eyes.


 Fire crashed at his back. Thunder and darkness exploded before him. He
 lurched forward, driven by the impact. Something was roaring, echoes
 clamorous in his helmet. He grew dimly aware that it was himself. Then
 he was falling, whirling down into the black between the stars.


 There was a knife in his back, it was white-hot and twisting between
 the ribs. He stumbled over the edge of the plain and fell, waking when
 his armor bounced a little against stone.


 Breath rattled in his throat as he turned his head. There was a white
 plume standing over his shoulder, air streaming out through the hole
 and freezing its moisture. The knife in him was not hot, it was cold
 with an ultimate cold.


 Around him, world and stars rippled as if seen through heat, through
 fever. He hung on the edge of creation by his fingertips, while chaos
 shouted beneath.
Theoretically, one man can run a spaceship, but in practice two
 or three are required for non-military craft. This is not only an
 emergency reserve, but a preventive of emergencies, for one man alone
 might get too tired at the critical moments. Bo knew he wouldn't be
 allowed to leave Achilles without a certified partner, and unemployed
 spacemen available for immediate hiring are found once in a Venusian
 snowfall.


 Bo didn't care the first day. He had taken Johnny out to Helmet Hill
 and laid him in the barren ground to wait, unchanging now, till
 Judgement Day. He felt empty then, drained of grief and hope alike,
 his main thought a dull dread of having to tell Johnny's father when
 he reached Luna. He was too slow and clumsy with words; his comforting
 hand would only break the old man's back. Old Malone had given six sons
 to space, Johnny was the last; from Saturn to the sun, his blood was
 strewn for nothing.


 It hardly seemed to matter that the Guards office reported itself
 unable to find the murderer. A single Venusian should have been easy to
 trace on Achilles, but he seemed to have vanished completely.


 Bo returned to the transient quarters and dialed Valeria McKittrick.
 She looked impatiently at him out of the screen. ""Well,"" she said,
 ""what's the matter? I thought we were blasting today.""


 ""Hadn't you heard?"" asked Bo. He found it hard to believe she could
 be ignorant, here where everybody's life was known to everybody else.
 ""Johnny's dead. We can't leave.""


 ""Oh ... I'm sorry. He was such a nice little man—I've been in the lab
 all the time, packing my things, and didn't know."" A frown crossed her
 clear brow. ""But you've got to get me back. I've engaged passage to
 Luna with you.""


 ""Your ticket will be refunded, of course,"" said Bo heavily. ""But you
 aren't certified, and the
Sirius
is licensed for no less than two
 operators.""


 ""Well ... damn! There won't be another berth for weeks, and I've
got
to get home. Can't you find somebody?""


 Bo shrugged, not caring much. ""I'll circulate an ad if you want, but—""


 ""Do so, please. Let me know."" She switched off.


 Bo sat for a moment thinking about her. Valeria McKittrick was worth
 considering. She wasn't beautiful in any conventional sense but she was
 tall and well built; there were good lines in the strong high boned
 face, and her hair was a cataract of spectacular red. And brains,
 too ... you didn't get to be a physicist with the Union's radiation
 labs for nothing. He knew she was still young, and that she had been on
 Achilles for about a year working on some special project and was now
 ready to go home.


 She was human enough, had been to most of the officers' parties and
 danced and laughed and flirted mildly, but even the dullest rockhound
 gossip knew she was too lost in her work to do more. Out here a woman
 was rare, and a virtuous woman unheard-of; as a result, unknown to
 herself, Dr. McKittrick's fame had spread through more thousands of
 people and millions of miles than her professional achievements were
 ever likely to reach.


 Since coming here, on commission from the Lunar lab, to bring her
 home, Bo Jonsson had given her an occasional wistful thought. He liked
 intelligent women, and he was getting tired of rootlessness. But of
 course it would be a catastrophe if he fell in love with her because
 she wouldn't look twice at a big dumb slob like him. He had sweated out
 a couple of similar affairs in the past and didn't want to go through
 another.


 He placed his ad on the radinews circuit and then went out to get
 drunk. It was all he could do for Johnny now, drink him a final
 wassail. Already his friend was cold under the stars. In the course of
 the evening he found himself weeping.


 He woke up many hours later. Achilles ran on Earth time but did not
 rotate on it; officially, it was late at night, actually the shrunken
 sun was high over the domes. The man in the upper bunk said there was a
 message for him; he was to call one Einar Lundgard at the Comet Hotel
 soonest.


 The Comet! Anyone who could afford a room to himself here, rather than
 a kip in the public barracks, was well fueled. Bo swallowed a tablet
 and made his way to the visi and dialed. The robo-clerk summoned
 Lundgard down to the desk.


 It was a lean, muscular face under close cropped brown hair which
 appeared in the screen. Lundgard was a tall and supple man, somehow
 neat even without clothes. ""Jonsson,"" said Bo. ""Sorry to get you up,
 but I understood—""


 ""Oh, yes. Are you looking for a spaceman? I heard your ad and I'm
 available.""


 Bo felt his mouth gape open. ""Huh? I never thought—""


 ""We're both lucky, I guess."" Lundgard chuckled. His English had only
 the slightest trace of accent, less than Bo's. ""I thought I was stashed
 here too for the next several months.""


 ""How does a qualified spaceman happen to be marooned?""


 ""I'm with Fireball, was on the
Drake
—heard of what happened to her?""


 Bo nodded, for every spaceman knows exactly what every spaceship is
 doing at any given time. The
Drake
had come to Achilles to pick up
 a cargo of refined thorium for Earth; while she lay in orbit, she had
 somehow lost a few hundred pounds of reaction-mass water from a cracked
 gasket. Why the accident should have occurred, nobody knew ... spacemen
 were not careless about inspections, and what reason would anyone have
 for sabotage? The event had taken place about a month ago, when the
Sirius
was already enroute here; Bo had heard of it in the course of
 shop talk.


 ""I thought she went back anyway,"" he said.


 Lundgard nodded. ""She did. It was the usual question of economics.
 You know what refined fuel water costs in the Belt; also, the delay
 while we got it would have carried Earth and Achilles past optimum
 position, which'd make the trip home that much more expensive. Since we
 had one more man aboard than really required, it was cheaper to leave
 him behind; the difference in mass would make up for the fuel loss. I
 volunteered, even suggested the idea, because ... well, it happened
 during my watch, and even if nobody blamed me I couldn't help feeling
 guilty.""


 Bo understood that kind of loyalty. You couldn't travel space without
 men who had it.


 ""The Company beamed a message: I'd stay here till their schedule
 permitted an undermanned ship to come by, but that wouldn't be for
 maybe months,"" went on Lundgard. ""I can't see sitting on this lump that
 long without so much as a chance at planetfall bonus. If you'll take me
 on, I'm sure the Company will agree; I'll get a message to them on the
 beam right away.""


 ""Take us a while to get back,"" warned Bo. ""We're going to stop off at
 another asteroid to pick up some automatic equipment, and won't go into
 hyperbolic orbit till after that. About six weeks from here to Earth,
 all told.""


 ""Against six months here?"" Lundgard laughed; it emphasized the bright
 charm of his manner. ""Sunblaze. I'll work for free.""


 ""No need to. Bring your papers over tomorrow, huh?""


 The certificate and record were perfectly in order, showing Einar
 Lundgard to be a Spacetech 1/cl with eight years' experience,
 qualified as engineer, astronaut, pilot, and any other of the thousand
 professions which have run into one. They registered articles and shook
 hands on it. ""Call me Bo. It really is my name ... Swedish.""


 ""Another squarehead, eh?"" grinned Lundgard. ""I'm from South America
 myself.""


 ""Notice a year's gap here,"" said Bo, pointing to the service record.
 ""On Venus.""


 ""Oh, yes. I had some fool idea about settling but soon learned better.
 I tried to farm, but when you have to carve your own land out of
 howling desert—Well, let's start some math, shall we?""


 They were lucky, not having to wait their turn at the station computer;
 no other ship was leaving immediately. They fed it the data and
 requirements, and got back columns of numbers: fuel requirements,
 acceleration times, orbital elements. The figures always had to be
 modified, no trip ever turned out just as predicted, but that could be
 done when needed with a slipstick and the little ship's calculator.


 Bo went at his share of the job doggedly, checking and re-checking
 before giving the problem to the machine; Lundgard breezed through it
 and spent his time while waiting for Bo in swapping dirty limericks
 with the tech. He had some good ones.


 The
Sirius
was loaded, inspected, and cleared. A ""scooter"" brought
 her three passengers up to her orbit, they embarked, settled down, and
 waited. At the proper time, acceleration jammed them back in a thunder
 of rockets.


 Bo relaxed against the thrust, thinking of Achilles falling away behind
 them. ""So long,"" he whispered. ""So long, Johnny.""
III


 In another minute, he would be knotted and screaming from the bends,
 and a couple of minutes later he would be dead.


 Bo clamped his teeth together, as if he would grip consciousness in
 his jaws. His hands felt cold and heavy, the hands of a stranger, as
 he fumbled for the supply pouch. It seemed to recede from him, down a
 hollow infinite corridor where echoes talked in a language he did not
 know.


 ""Damn,"" he gasped. ""Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn.""


 He got the pouch open somehow. The stars wheeled around him. There
 were stars buzzing in his head, like cold white fireflies, buzzing and
 buzzing in the enormous ringing emptiness of his skull. Pain jagged
 through him, he felt his eardrums popping as pressure dropped.


 The plastic patch stuck to his metal gauntlet. He peeled it off, trying
 not to howl with the fury ripping in his nerves. His body was slow,
 inert, a thing to fight. There was no more feeling in his back, was he
 dead already?


 Redness flamed before his eyes, red like Valeria's hair blowing across
 the stars. It was sheer reflex which brought his arm around to slap the
 patch over the hole in his suit. The adhesive gripped, drying fast in
 the sucking vacuum. The patch bellied out from internal air pressure,
 straining to break loose and kill him.


 Bo's mind wavered back toward life. He opened the valves wide on his
 tanks, and his thermostatic capacitors pumped heat back into him. For
 a long time he lay there, only lungs and heart had motion. His throat
 felt withered and flayed, but the rasp of air through it was like being
 born again.


 Born, spewed out of an iron womb into a hollowness of stars and cold,
 to lie on naked rock while the enemy hunted him. Bo shuddered and
 wanted to scream again.


 Slowly he groped back toward awareness. His frostbitten back tingled
 as it warmed up again, soon it would be afire. He could feel a hot
 trickling of blood, but it was along his right side. The bullet must
 have spent most of its force punching through the armor, caromed off
 the inside, scratched his ribs, and fallen dead. Next time he probably
 wouldn't be so lucky. A magnetic-driven .30 slug would go through
 a helmet, splashing brains as it passed.


 He turned his head, feeling a great weariness, and looked at the
 gauges. This had cost him a lot of air. There was only about three
 hours worth left. Lundgard could kill him simply by waiting.


 It would be easy to die. He lay on his back, staring up at the stars
 and the spilling cloudy glory of the Milky Way. A warmth was creeping
 back into numbed hands and feet; soon he would be warm all over, and
 sleepy. His eyelids felt heavy, strange that they should be so heavy on
 an asteroid.


 He wanted terribly to sleep.

Tick-de-tock,
tick-de-tock
, whispered the antique clock on the first
 floor of the house.


 There was no sound save for the ticking—and for the pounding of
 Ronnie's heart.


 He stood alone in his upstairs bedroom. His slender-boned,
 eight-year-old body trembling, perspiration glittering on his white
 forehead.


 To Ronnie, the clock seemed to be saying:
Daddy's coming, Daddy's coming.
The soft shadows of September twilight in this year of 2056 were
 seeping into the bedroom. Ronnie welcomed the fall of darkness. He
 wanted to sink into its deep silence, to become one with it, to escape
 forever from savage tongues and angry eyes.


 A burst of hope entered Ronnie's fear-filled eyes. Maybe something
 would happen. Maybe Dad would have an accident. Maybe—


 He bit his lip hard, shook his head. No. No matter what Dad might do,
 it wasn't right to wish—


 The whirling whine of a gyro-car mushroomed up from the landing
 platform outside.


 Ronnie shivered, his pulse quickening. The muscles in his small body
 were like a web of taut-drawn wires.


 Sound and movement below. Mom flicking off the controls of the
 kitchen's Auto-Chef. The slow stride of her high heels through the
 living room. The slamming of a gyro-car door. The opening of the front
 door of the house.


 Dad's deep, happy voice echoed up the stairway:


 ""Hi, beautiful!""


 Ronnie huddled in the darkness by the half-open bedroom door.
Please, Mama
, his mind cried,
please don't tell Daddy what I did.
There was a droning, indistinct murmur.


 Dad burst, ""He was doing
what
?""


 More murmuring.


 ""I can't believe it. You really saw him?... I'll be damned.""


 Ronnie silently closed the bedroom door.
Why did you tell him, Mama? Why did you have to tell him?
""Ronnie!"" Dad called.


 Ronnie held his breath. His legs seemed as numb and nerveless as the
 stumps of dead trees.


 ""
Ronnie! Come down here!
""
Like an automaton, Ronnie shuffled out of his bedroom. He stepped
 on the big silver disk on the landing. The auto-stairs clicked into
 humming movement under his weight.


 To his left, on the wall, he caught kaleidoscopic glimpses of Mom's old
 pictures, copies of paintings by medieval artists like Rembrandt, Van
 Gogh, Cezanne, Dali. The faces seemed to be mocking him. Ronnie felt
 like a wounded bird falling out of the sky.


 He saw that Dad and Mom were waiting for him.


 Mom's round blue eyes were full of mist and sadness. She hadn't
 bothered to smooth her clipped, creamy-brown hair as she always did
 when Dad was coming home.


 And Dad, handsome in his night-black, skin-tight Pentagon uniform, had
 become a hostile stranger with narrowed eyes of black fire.


 ""Is it true, Ronnie?"" asked Dad. ""Were you really—really reading a
 book?""


 Ronnie gulped. He nodded.


 ""Good Lord,"" Dad murmured. He took a deep breath and squatted down,
 held Ronnie's arms and looked hard into his eyes. For an instant he
 became the kind, understanding father that Ronnie knew.


 ""Tell me all about it, son. Where did you get the book? Who taught you
 to read?""


 Ronnie tried to keep his legs from shaking. ""It was—Daddy, you won't
 make trouble, will you?""


 ""This is between you and me, son. We don't care about anyone else.""


 ""Well, it was Kenny Davis. He—""


 Dad's fingers tightened on Ronnie's arms. ""Kenny Davis!"" he spat. ""The
 boy's no good. His father never had a job in his life. Nobody'd even
 offer him a job. Why, the whole town knows he's a Reader!""


 Mom stepped forward. ""David, you promised you'd be sensible about this.
 You promised you wouldn't get angry.""


 Dad grunted. ""All right, son. Go ahead.""


 ""Well, one day after school Kenny said he'd show me something. He took
 me to his house—""


 ""You went to that
shack
? You actually—""


 ""Dear,"" said Mom. ""You promised.""


 A moment of silence.


 Ronnie said, ""He took me to his house. I met his dad. Mr. Davis is lots
 of fun. He has a beard and he paints pictures and he's collected almost
 five hundred books.""


 Ronnie's voice quavered.


 ""Go on,"" said Dad sternly.


 ""And I—and Mr. Davis said he'd teach me to read them if I promised not
 to tell anybody. So he taught me a little every day after school—oh,
 Dad, books are fun to read. They tell you things you can't see on the
 video or hear on the tapes.""


 ""How long ago did all this start?


 ""T—two years ago.""


 Dad rose, fists clenched, staring strangely at nothing.


 ""Two years,"" he breathed. ""I thought I had a good son, and yet for two
 years—"" He shook his head unbelievingly. ""Maybe it's my own fault.
 Maybe I shouldn't have come to this small town. I should have taken a
 house in Washington instead of trying to commute.""


 ""David,"" said Mom, very seriously, almost as if she were praying, ""it
 won't be necessary to have him memory-washed, will it?""


 Dad looked at Mom, frowning. Then he gazed at Ronnie. His soft-spoken
 words were as ominous as the low growl of thunder:


 ""I don't know, Edith. I don't know.""
Dad strode to his easy chair by the fireplace. He sank into its
 foam-rubber softness, sighing. He murmured a syllable into a tiny
 ball-mike on the side of the chair. A metallic hand raised a lighted
 cigarette to his lips.


 ""Come here, son.""


 Ronnie followed and sat on the hassock by Dad's feet.


 ""Maybe I've never really explained things to you, Ronnie. You see, you
 won't always be a boy. Someday you'll have to find a way of making a
 living. You've only two choices: You work for the government, like I
 do, or for a corporation.""


 Ronnie blinked. ""Mr. Davis doesn't work for the gover'ment or for a
 corpor-ation.""


 ""Mr. Davis isn't normal,"" Dad snapped. ""He's a hermit. No decent family
 would let him in their house. He grows his own food and sometimes he
 takes care of gardens for people. I want you to have more than that. I
 want you to have a nice home and be respected by people.""


 Dad puffed furiously on his cigarette.


 ""And you can't get ahead if people know you've been a Reader. That's
 something you can't live down. No matter how hard you try, people
 always stumble upon the truth.""


 Dad cleared his throat. ""You see, when you get a job, all the
 information you handle will have a classification. It'll be Restricted,
 Low-Confidential, Confidential, High-Confidential, Secret, Top-Secret.
 And all this information will be in writing. No matter what you do,
 you'll have access to some of this information at one time or another.""
""B—but why do these things have to be so secret?"" Ronnie asked.


 ""Because of competitors, in the case of corporations—or because of
 enemy nations in the case of government work. The written material you
 might have access to could describe secret weapons and new processes
 or plans for next year's advertising—maybe even a scheme for, er,
 liquidation of a rival. If all facts and policies were made public,
 there might be criticism, controversy, opposition by certain groups.
 The less people know about things, the better. So we have to keep all
 these things secret.""


 Ronnie scowled. ""But if things are written down, someone has to read
 them, don't they?""


 ""Sure, son. One person in ten thousand might reach the point where
 his corporation or bureau will teach him to read. But you prove your
 ability and loyalty first. By the time you're 35 or 40, they might
want
you to learn to read. But for young people and children—well,
 it just isn't done. Why, the President himself wasn't trusted to learn
 till he was nearly fifty!""


 Dad straightened his shoulders. ""Look at me. I'm only 30, but I've been
 a messenger for Secret material already. In a few years, if things go
 well, I should be handling
Top
-Secret stuff. And who knows? Maybe by
 the time I'm 50 I'll be
giving
orders instead of carrying them. Then
 I'll learn to read, too. That's the right way to do it.""


 Ronnie shifted uncomfortably on the hassock. ""But can't a Reader get a
 job that's not so important. Like a barber or a plumber or—""


 ""Don't you understand? The barber and plumbing equipment corporations
 set up their stores and hire men to work for them. You think they'd
 hire a Reader? People'd say you were a spy or a subversive or that
 you're crazy like old man Davis.""


 ""Mr. Davis isn't crazy. And he isn't old. He's young, just like you,
 and—""


 ""Ronnie!""


 Dad's voice was knife-sharp and December-cold. Ronnie slipped off the
 hassock as if struck physically by the fury of the voice. He sat
 sprawled on his small posterior, fresh fear etched on his thin features.


 ""Damn it, son, how could you even
think
of being a Reader? You've got
 a life-sized, 3-D video here, and we put on the smell and touch and
 heat attachments just for you. You can listen to any tape in the world
 at school. Ronnie, don't you realize I'd lose my job if people knew I
 had a Reader for a son?""


 ""B—but, Daddy—""


 Dad jumped to his feet. ""I hate to say it, Edith, but we've got to put
 this boy in a reformatory. Maybe a good memory-wash will take some of
 the nonsense out of him!""
Ronnie suppressed a sob. ""No, Daddy, don't let them take away my brain.
 Please—""


 Dad stood very tall and very stiff, not even looking at him. ""They
 won't take your brain, just your memory for the past two years.""


 A corner of Mom's mouth twitched. ""David, I didn't want anything like
 this. I thought maybe Ronnie could have a few private psychiatric
 treatments. They can do wonderful things now—permi-hypnosis, creations
 of artificial psychic blocks. A memory-wash would mean that Ronnie'd
 have the mind of a six-year-old child again. He'd have to start to
 school all over again.""


 Dad returned to his chair. He buried his face in trembling hands, and
 some of his anger seemed replaced by despair. ""Lord, Edith, I don't
 know what to do.""


 He looked up abruptly, as if struck by a chilling new thought. ""You
 can't keep a two-year memory-wash a secret. I never thought of that
 before. Why, that alone would mean the end of my promotions.""


 Silence settled over the room, punctuated only by the ticking of the
 antique clock. All movement seemed frozen, as if the room lay at the
 bottom of a cold, thick sea.


 ""David,"" Mom finally said.


 ""Yes?""


 ""There's only one solution. We can't destroy two years of Ronnie's
 memory—you said that yourself. So we'll have to take him to a
 psychiatrist or maybe a psychoneurologist. A few short treatments—""


 Dad interrupted: ""But he'd
still
remember how to read, unconsciously
 anyway. Even permi-hypnosis would wear off in time. The boy can't keep
 going to psychiatrists for the rest of his life.""


 Thoughtfully he laced his fingers together. ""Edith, what kind of a book
 was he reading?""


 A tremor passed through Mom's slender body. ""There were three books on
 his bed. I'm not sure which one he was actually reading.""


 Dad groaned. ""
Three
of them. Did you burn them?""


 ""No, dear, not yet.""


 ""Why not?""


 ""I don't know. Ronnie seemed to like them so much. I thought that maybe
 tonight, after you d seen them—""


 ""Get them, damn it. Let's burn the filthy things.""


 Mom went to a mahogany chest in the dining room, produced three faded
 volumes. She put them on the hassock at Dad's feet.


 Dad gingerly turned a cover. His lips curled in disgust as if he were
 touching a rotting corpse.


 ""Old,"" he mused, ""—so very old. Ironic, isn't it? Our lives are being
 wrecked by things that should have been destroyed and forgotten a
 hundred years ago.""


 A sudden frown contorted his dark features.
Tick-de-tock, tick-de-tock
, said the antique clock.


 ""A hundred years old,"" he repeated. His mouth became a hard, thin line.
 ""Edith, I think I know why Ronnie wanted to read, why he fell into the
 trap so easily.""


 ""What do you mean, David?""


 Dad nodded at the clock, and the slow, smouldering anger returned to
 his face. ""It's
your
fault, Edith. You've always liked old things.
 That clock of your great-great-grandmother's. Those old prints on the
 wall. That stamp collection you started for Ronnie—stamps dated way
 back to the 1940's.""


 Mom's face paled. ""I don't understand.""


 ""You've interested Ronnie in old things. To a child in its formative
 years, in a pleasant house, these things symbolize peace and security.
 Ronnie's been conditioned from the very time of his birth to like old
 things. It was natural for him to be attracted by books. And we were
 just too stupid to realize it.""


 Mom whispered hoarsely, ""I'm sorry, David.""


 Hot anger flashed in Dad's eyes. ""It isn't enough to be sorry. Don't
 you see what this means? Ronnie'll have to be memory-washed back to the
 time of birth. He'll have to start life all over again.""


 ""No, David, no!""


 ""And in my position I can't afford to have an eight-year-old son with
 the mind of a new-born baby. It's got to be Abandonment, Edith, there's
 no other way. The boy can start life over in a reformatory, with a
 complete memory-wash. He'll never know we existed, and he'll never
 bother us again.""


 Mom ran up to Dad. She put her hands on his shoulders. Great sobs burst
 from her shaking body.


 ""You can't, David! I won't let—""


 He slapped her then with the palm of his hand. The sound was like a
 pistol shot in the hot, tight air.


 Dad stood now like a colossus carved of black ice. His right hand was
 still upraised, ready to strike again.


 Then his hand fell. His mind seemed to be toying with a new thought, a
 new concept.


 He seized one of the books on the hassock.


 ""Edith,"" he said crisply, ""just what was Ronnie reading? What's the
 name of this book?""


 ""
The—The Adventures of Tom Sawyer
,"" said Mom through her sobs.


 He grabbed the second book, held it before her shimmering vision.


 ""And the name of this?""


 ""
Tarzan of The Apes.
"" Mom's voice was a barely audible croak.


 ""Who's the author?""


 ""Edgar Rice Burroughs.""


 ""And this one?""


 ""
The Wizard of Oz.
""


 ""Who wrote it?""


 ""L. Frank Baum.""


 He threw the books to the floor. He stepped backward. His face was a
 mask of combined sorrow, disbelief, and rage.


 ""
Edith.
"" He spat the name as if it were acid on his tongue. ""Edith,
you can read
!""
Mom sucked in her sobs. Her chalk-white cheeks were still streaked with
 rivulets of tears.


 ""I'm sorry, David. I've never told anyone—not even Ronnie. I haven't
 read a book, haven't even looked at one since we were married. I've
 tried to be a good wife—""


 ""A good wife."" Dad sneered. His face was so ugly that Ronnie looked
 away.


 Mom continued, ""I—I learned when I was just a girl. I was young like
 Ronnie. You know how young people are—reckless, eager to do forbidden
 things.""


 ""You lied to me,"" Dad snapped. ""For ten years you've lied to me. Why
 did you want to read, Edith?
Why?
""


 Mom was silent for a few seconds. She was breathing heavily, but no
 longer crying. A calmness entered her features, and for the first time
 tonight Ronnie saw no fear in her eyes.


 ""I wanted to read,"" she said, her voice firm and proud, ""because, as
 Ronnie said, it's fun. The video's nice, with its dancers and lovers
 and Indians and spacemen—but sometimes you want more than that.
 Sometimes you want to know how people feel deep inside and how they
 think. And there are beautiful words and beautiful thoughts, just like
 there are beautiful paintings. It isn't enough just to hear them and
 then forget them. Sometimes you want to keep the words and thoughts
 before you because in that way you feel that they belong to you.""


 Her words echoed in the room until absorbed by the ceaseless, ticking
 clock. Mom stood straight and unashamed. Dad's gaze traveled slowly to
 Ronnie, to Mom, to the clock, back and forth.


 At last he said, ""Get out.""


 Mom stared blankly.


 ""Get out. Both of you. You can send for your things later. I never want
 to see either of you again.""


 ""David—""


 ""I said
get out
!""


 Ronnie and Mom left the house. Outside, the night was dark and a wind
 was rising. Mom shivered in her thin house cloak.


 ""Where will we go, Ronnie? Where, where—""


 ""I know a place. Maybe we can stay there—for a little while.""


 ""A little while?"" Mom echoed. Her mind seemed frozen by the cold wind.


 Ronnie led her through the cold, windy streets. They left the lights of
 the town behind them. They stumbled over a rough, dirt country road.
 They came to a small, rough-boarded house in the deep shadow of an
 eucalyptus grove. The windows of the house were like friendly eyes of
 warm golden light.


 An instant later a door opened and a small boy ran out to meet them.


 ""Hi, Kenny.""


 ""Hi. Who's that? Your mom?""


 ""Yep. Mr. Davis in?""


 ""Sure.""


 And a kindly-faced, bearded young man appeared in the golden doorway,
 smiling.


 Ronnie and Mom stepped inside.

In all the solar system there is no city quite like Mercis, capital
 of Mars. Solis, on Venus, is perhaps more beautiful, some cities of
 Earth certainly have more drive and dynamitism, but there is a strange
 inscrutable air about Mercis which even terrestials of twenty years'
 residence cannot explain. Outwardly a tourists' mecca, with white
 plastoid buildings, rich gardens, and whispering canals, it has another
 and darker side, ever present, ever hidden. While earthmen work and
 plan, building, repairing, bringing their vast energy and progress
 to decadent Mars, the silent little reddies go their devious ways,
 following ancient laws which no amount of terrestial logic can shake.
 Time-bound ritual, mysterious passions and hates, torturous, devious
 logic ... all these, like dark winding underground streams run beneath
 the tall fair city that brings such thrilled superlatives to the lips
 of the terrestial tourists.


 Steve Ranson, mounting the steps of the old house facing the Han
 canal, was in no mood for the bizarre beauties of Martian scenery. For
 one thing, Mercis was an old story to him; his work with Terrestial
 Intelligence had brought him here often in the past, on other strange
 cases. And for another thing, his mission concerned more vital matters.
 Jared Haller, as head of the state-owned Martian Broadcasting System,
 was next in importance to the august Governor Winship himself. As
 far back as the Hitlerian wars on earth it had been known that he
 who controls propaganda, controls the nation ... or planet. Martian
 Broadcasting was an important factor in controlling the fierce warlike
 little reddies, keeping the terrestial-imposed peace on the red
 planet. And when Jared Haller sent to Earth for one of the Terrestial
 Intelligence, that silent efficient corps of trouble-shooters,
 something was definitely up.


 The house was provided with double doors as protection against the
 sudden fierce sandstorms which so often, in the month of Tol, sweep
 in from the plains of Psidis to engulf Mercis in a red choking haze.
 Ranson passed the conventional electric eye and a polite robot voice
 asked his name. He gave it, and the inner door opened.


 A smiling little Martian butler met him in the hall, showed him into
 Haller's study. The head of M.B.C. stood at one end of the big library,
 the walls of which were lined with vivavox rolls and old-fashioned
 books. As Ranson entered, he swung about, frowning, one hand dropping
 to a pocket that bulged unmistakably.


 ""Ranson, Terrestial Intelligence."" The special agent offered his card.
 ""You sent to Earth a while ago for an operator?""


 Jared Haller nodded. He was a big, rough-featured individual with gray
 leonine hair. A battering-ram of a man, one would think, who hammered
 his way through life by sheer force and drive. But as Ranson looked
 closer, he could see lines of worry, of fear, etched about the strong
 mouth, and a species of terror within the shaggy-browed eyes.


 ""Yes,"" said Jared Haller. ""I sent for an operator. You got here
 quickly, Mr. Ranson!""


 ""Seven days out of earth on the express-liner
Arrow
."" Ranson wondered
 why Haller didn't come to the point. Even Terrestial Intelligence
 headquarters in New York hadn't known why a T.I. man was wanted on
 Mars ... but Haller was one of the few persons sufficiently important
 to have an operator sent without explanation as to why he was wanted.
 Ranson put it directly. ""Why did you require the help of T.I., Mr.
 Haller?"" he asked.


 ""Because we're up against something a little too big for the Mercian
 police force to handle."" Jared Haller's strong hands tapped nervously
 upon the desk. ""No one has greater respect for our local authorities
 than myself. Captain Maxwell is a personal friend of mine. But I
 understood that T.I. men had the benefit of certain amazing devices,
 remarkable inventions, which make it easy for them to track down
 criminals.""


 Ranson nodded. That was true. T.I. didn't allow its secret devices
 to be used by any other agency, for fear they might become known to
 the criminals and outlaws of the solar system. But Haller still hadn't
 told what crime had taken place. This time Ranson applied the spur of
 silence. It worked.


 ""Mr. Ranson,"" Haller leaned forward, his face a gray grim mask,
 ""someone, something, is working to gain control of the Martian
 Broadcasting Company! And I don't have to tell you that whoever
 controls M.B.C. controls Mars! Here's the set-up! Our company, although
 state owned, is largely free from red-tape, so long as we stress the
 good work we terrestials are doing on Mars and keep any revolutionary
 propaganda off the air-waves. Except for myself, and half a dozen other
 earthmen in responsible positions, our staff is largely Martian.
 That's in line with our policy of teaching Mars our civilization until
 it's ready for autonomy. Which it isn't yet, by quite some. As you
 know.""


 Ranson nodded, eyes intent as the pattern unfolded.


 ""All right."" Haller snapped. ""You see the situation. Remove us ... the
 few terrestials at the top of M.B.C ... and Martian staff would carry
 on until new men came out from Earth to take our places. But suppose
 during that period with no check on their activities, they started
 to dish out nationalist propaganda? One hour's program, with the old
 Martian war-songs being played and some rabble-rouser yelling 'down
 with the terrestial oppressors' and there'd be a revolution. Millions
 of reddies against a few police, a couple of regiments of the Foreign
 Legion. It'd be a cinch.""


 ""But,"" ... Ranson frowned ... ""this is only an interesting supposition.
 The reddies are civilized, peaceful.""


 ""Outwardly,"" Haller snapped. ""But what do you or any other earthmen
 know about what goes on in their round red heads? And the proof that
 some revolt is planned lies in what's been happening the past few
 weeks! Look here!"" Haller bent forward, the lines about his mouth
 tighter than ever. ""Three weeks ago my technical advisor, Rawlins,
 committed suicide. Not a care in the world, but he killed himself. A
 week later Harris, head of the television department, went insane.
 Declared a feud with the whole planet, began shooting at everyone he
 saw. The police rayed him in the struggle. The following week Pegram,
 the musical director, died of a heart attack. Died with the most
 terrorized expression on his face I've ever seen. Fear, causing the
 heart attack, his doctor said. You begin to see the set-up? Three men,
 each a vital power in M.B.C. gone within three weeks! And who's next?
 Who?"" Jared Haller's eyes were bright with fear.


 ""Suicide, insanity, heart attack."" Ranson shrugged. ""All perfectly
 normal. Coincidence that they should happen within three weeks. What
 makes you think there's been foul play?""


 For a long brittle moment Jared Haller stared out at the graceful white
 city, wan in the light of the twin moons. When he turned to face
 Ranson again, his eyes were bleak as a lunar plain.


 ""One thing,"" he said slowly. ""The music.""


 ""Music?"" Ranson echoed. ""Look here, Mr. Haller, you....""


 ""It's all right."" Jared Haller grinned crookedly. ""I'm not insane. Yet.
 Look, Mr. Ranson! There's just one clue to these mysterious deaths!
 And that's the music! In each instance the servants told of hearing,
 very faintly, a strange melody. Music that did queer things to them,
 even though they could hear it only vaguely. Music like none they'd
 ever heard. Like the devil's pipes, playing on their souls, while....
 Almighty God!""


 Jared Haller froze, his face gray as lead, his eyes blue horror. Ranson
 was like a man in a trance, bent forward, lips pressed tight until they
 resembled a livid scar. The room was silent as a tomb; outside, they
 could hear the vague rumbling of the city, with the distant swish of
 canal boats, the staccato roar of rockets as some earth-bound freighter
 leaped from the spaceport. Familiar, homey sounds, these, but beneath
 them, like an undercurrent of madness, ran the macabre melody.
There was, there had never been, Ranson knew, any music like this.
 It was the pipes of Pan, the chant of robots, the crying of souls in
 torment. It was a cloudy purple haze that engulfed the mind, it was a
 silver knife plucking a cruel obligato on taut nerves, it was a thin
 dark snake writhing its endless coils into the room.


 Neither man moved. Ranson knew all the tricks of visual hypnotism, the
 whirling mirror, the waving hands, the pool of ink ... but this was
 the hypnotism of sound. Louder and clearer the music sounded, in eerie
 overtones, quavering sobbing minors, fierce reverberating bass. Sharp
 shards of sound pierced their ears, deep throbbing underrhythm shook
 them as a cat shakes a mouse.


 ""God!"" Haller snarled. ""What ... what is it?""


 ""Don't know."" Ranson felt a queer irritation growing within him. He
 strode stiffly to the window, peered out. In the darkness, the broad
 Han canal lay placid; the stars caught in its jet meshes gently
 drifted toward the bank, shattered on the white marble. Along the
 embankment were great fragrant clumps of
fayeh
bushes. It was among
 these, he decided, that their unknown serenader lay concealed.


 Suddenly the elfin melody changed. Fierce, harsh, it rose, until Ranson
 felt as though a file were rasping his nerves. He knew that he should
 dash down, seize the invisible musician below ... but logic, facts and
 duty, all were fading from his mind. The music was a spur, goading him
 to wild unreasoning anger. The red mists of hate swirled through his
 brain, a strange unreasoning bloodlust grew with the savage beat of the
 wild music. Berserk rage sounded in each shivering note and Ranson felt
 an insane desire to run amok. To inflict pain, to see red blood flow,
 to kill ... kill! Blindly he whirled, groping for his gun, as the music
 rose in a frenzied death-wail.


 Turning, Ranson found himself face to face with Jared Haller. But the
 tall flinty magnate was now another person. Primitive, atavistic rage
 distorted his features, insane murder lurked in his eyes. The music was
 his master, and it was driving him to frenzy. ""Kill!"" the weird rhythm
 screamed, ""Kill!"" And Jared Haller obeyed. He snatched the flame-gun
 from his pocket, levelled it at Ranson.


 Whether it was the deadly melody outside, or the instinct of
 self-preservation, Ranson never knew, but he drove at Haller with grim
 fury. The flame-gun hissed, filling the room with a greenish glare, its
 beam passing so close to Ranson's hair as to singe it. Ranson came up,
 grinning furiously, and in a moment both men were struggling, teeth
 bared in animalistic grins, breath coming in choked gasps, whirling
 in a mad dance of death as the macabre music distilled deadly poison
 within their brains.


 The end came with startling suddenness. Ranson, twisting his opponent's
 arm back, felt the searing blast of the flame-gun past his hand. Jared
 Haller, a ghastly blackened corpse, toppled to the floor.


 At that moment the lethal rhythm outside changed abruptly. From the
 fierce maddening beat of a few minutes before, the chords took on a
 yearning seductive tone. A call, it seemed, irresistible, soft, with
 a thousand promises. This was the song the sirens sang to Ulysses,
 the call of the Pied Piper, the chant of the houris in paradise. It
 conjured up pictures in Ranson's mind ... pictures of fairyland, of
 exquisitely beautiful scenes, of women lovely beyond imagination. All
 of man's hopes, man's dreams, were in that music, and it drew Ranson as
 a moth is drawn to a flame. The piping of Pan, the fragile fantasies of
 childhood, the voices of those beyond life.... Ranson walked stiffly
 toward the source of the music, like a man drugged.


 As he approached the window the melody grew louder. The hypnotism of
 sound, he knew, but he didn't care. It was enthralling, irresistible.
 Like a sleepwalker he climbed to the sill, stood outlined in the tall
 window. Twenty feet to the ground, almost certain death ... but Ranson
 was lost in the golden world that the elfin melody conjured up. He
 straightened his shoulders, was about to step out.


 Then suddenly there was a roar of atomic motors, a flashing of lights.
 A police boat, flinging up clouds of spray, swept up the canal,
 stopped. Ranson shook himself, like a man awakening from a nightmare,
 saw uniformed figures leaping to the bank. From the shadow of the
fayeh
bushes a slight form sprang, dodged along the embankment.
 Flame-guns cut the gloom but the slight figure swung to the left,
 disappeared among the twisting narrow streets. Bathed in cold sweat,
 Ranson stepped back into the room, where the still, terrible form of
 Jared Haller lay. Ranson stared at it, as though seeing it for the
 first time. Outside, there were pounding feet; the canal-patrolmen
 raced through the house, toward the study. And then, his brain weary as
 if it had been cudgelled, Ranson slid limply to the floor.
Headquarters of the Martian Canal-Patrol was brilliantly lighted by a
 dozen big
astralux
arcs. Captain Maxwell chewed at his gray mustache,
 staring curiously at Ranson.


 ""Then you admit killing Haller?"" he demanded.


 ""Yes."" Ranson nodded sombrely. ""In the struggle. Self-defense. But even
 if it hadn't been self-defense, I probably would have fought with him.
 That music was madness, I tell you! Madness! Nobody's responsible when
 under its influence! I....""


 ""You killed Haller,"" Captain Maxwell said. ""And you blame it on this
 alleged music. I might believe you, Ranson, but how many other people
 would? Even members of Terrestial Intelligence aren't sacro sanct. I'll
 have to hold you for trial.""


 ""Hold me for trial?"" Ranson leaned forward, his gaunt face intent.
 ""While the real killer, the person playing that music, gets away? Look!
 Let me out of here for twelve hours! That's all I ask! And if I don't
 track down whoever was outside Haller's house, you can....""


 ""Sorry."" Captain Maxwell shook his head. ""You know I'd like to, Ranson.
 But this is murder. To let a confessed murderer, even though he is a
 T.I. man, go free, is impossible."" The captain drew a deep breath,
 motioned to the two gray-uniformed patrolmen. ""Take Mr. Ranson.""


 And then Steve Ranson went into action. In one blinding burst of
 speed, he lunged across the desk, tore Captain Maxwell's pistol from
 its holster. Before the captain and the two patrolmen knew what had
 happened, they were staring into the ugly muzzle of the flame-gun.


 ""Sorry."" Ranson said tightly. ""But it had to be done. There's hell
 loose on Mars, the devil's melody! And it's got to be stopped before it
 turns this planet upside down!""


 ""You can't get away with this, Ranson!"" Captain Maxwell shook his head.
 ""It'll only make it tougher for you when we nab you again! Be sensible!
 Put down that gun.""


 ""No good. Got to work fast."" Ranson backed toward the door, gun
 in hand. ""Let this mad music go unchecked and it's death to all
 terrestials on Mars! And I'm going to stop it! So long, captain! You
 can try me for murder if you want, after I've done my job here!""


 Ranson took the key from the massive plastic door as he backed
 through the entrance. Once in the hall, he slammed the door shut,
 locked Maxwell and his men in the room. Then, dropping the gun into
 his pocket, he ran swiftly down the corridor to the main entrance of
 headquarters. In the hall a patrolman glanced at him suspiciously,
 halted him, but a wave of Ranson's T.I. card put the man aside.


 Free of headquarters, Ranson began to run. Only a few moments, he
 knew, before Maxwell and his men blasted a way to freedom, set out in
 pursuit. Like a lean gray shadow Ranson ran, twisting, dodging, among
 the narrow streets, heading toward Haller's house. Mercis was a dream
 city in the wan light of the moons. One in either side of the heavens,
 they threw weird double shadows across the rippling canals, the aimless
 streets. Sleek canal-cabs roared along the dark waterways, throwing
 up clouds of spray, and on the embankments, green-eyed, bulge-headed
 little reddies padded, silent, inscrutable, themselves a part of the
 eternal mystery of Mars.


 Haller's house stood dark and brooding beside the canal. Captain
 Maxwell's men had completed their examination and the place was
 deserted. Ranson stepped into the shadow of the clump of fragrant
fayeh
bushes, where the unknown musician had stood; there was little
 danger, he felt, of patrolmen hunting for him at Haller's house.
 The captain had little faith in copybook maxims about the murderer
 returning to the scene of the crime.


 Ranson stood motionless for a moment as a canal boat swept by, then
 drew from his pocket a heavy black tube. He tugged, and it extended
 telescopically to a cane some four feet long. The cane was hollow, a
 tube, and the head of it was large as a man's two fists and covered
 with small dials, gauges. This was the T.I.'s most cherished secret,
 the famous ""electric bloodhound,"" by which criminals could be tracked.


 Ranson touched a lever and a tiny electric motor in the head of the
 cane hummed, drawing air up along the tube. He tapped the bank where
 the unknown musician had stood, eyes on the gauges. Molecules of
 matter, left by the mysterious serenader, were sucked up the tube,
 registered on a sensitive plate, just as delicate color shades register
 on the plate of a color camera.


 Ranson tapped the cane carefully upon the ground, avoiding those places
 where he had stood. Few people crossed this overgrown embankment, and
 it was a safe bet that no one other than the strange musician had
 been there recently. The scent was a clear one, and the dials on the
 head of the cane read R-2340-B, the numerical classification of the
 tiny bits of matter left behind by the unknown. The theory behind it
 was quite simple. The T.I. scientists had reasoned that the sense of
 smell is merely the effect of suspended molecules in the air acting
 upon sensitive nerve filaments, and they knew that any normal human
 can follow a trail of some strong odor such as perfumes, or gasoline,
 while animals, possessing more sensitive perceptions, can follow
 less distinct trails. To duplicate this mechanically had proven more
 difficult than an electric eye or artificial hearing device, but in
 the end they had triumphed. Their efforts had resulted in the machine
 Ranson now carried.


 The trial was, at the start, clear. Ranson tapped the long tube on the
 ground like a blind man, eyes on the dial. Along the embankment, into a
 side street, he made his way. There were few abroad in this old quarter
 of the city; from the spaceport came the roar of freighters, the rumble
 of machinery, but here in the narrow winding streets there was only the
 faint murmur of voices behind latticed windows, the rustle of the wind,
 the rattle of sand from the red desert beyond the city.
As Ranson plunged further into the old Martian quarter, the trail grew
 more and more confused, crossed by scores of other trails left by
 passersby. He was forced to stop, cast about like a bloodhound, tapping
 every square foot of the street before the R-2340-B on the dial showed
 that he had once more picked up the faint elusive scent.


 Deeper and deeper Ranson plunged into the dark slums of Mercis. Smoky
 gambling dens, dives full of drunken spacehands and slim red-skinned
 girls, maudlin singing ... even the yellow glare of the forbidden
 san-rays, as they filtered through drawn windows. Unsteady figures made
 their way along the streets. Mighty-thewed Jovian blasters, languid
 Venusians, boisterous earthmen ... and the little Martians padding
 softly along, wrapped in their loose dust-robes.


 At the end of an alley where the purple shadows lay like stagnant
 pools, Ranson paused. The alley was a cul-de-sac, which meant that
 the person he was trailing must have entered one of the houses. Very
 softly he tapped the long tube on the ground. Again with a hesitant
 swinging of dials, R-2340-B showed up, on the low step in front of one
 of the dilapidated, dome-shaped houses. Ranson's eyes narrowed. So the
 person who had played the mad murder melody had entered that house!
 Might still be there! Quickly he telescoped the ""electric bloodhound,""
 dropped it into his pocket, and drew his flame-gun.


 The old house was dark, with an air of morbid deadly calm about
 it. Ranson tried the door, found it locked. A quick spurt from his
 flame-gun melted the lock; he glanced about to make sure no one had
 observed the greenish glare, then stepped inside.


 The hallway was shadowy, its walls hung with ancient Martian tapestries
 which, from their stilted symbolic ideographs must have dated back to
 the days of the Canal-Builders. At the end of the hallway, however,
 light jetted through a half-open door. Ranson moved toward it, silent
 as a phantom, muscles tense. Gripping his flame-gun, he pushed the door
 wide ... and a sudden exclamation broke from his lips.


 Before him lay a gleaming laboratory, lined with vials of strange
 liquids, shining test-tubes, and queer apparatus. Beside a table,
 pouring a black fluid from a beaker into a test-tube, stood a man.
 Half-terrestial, half-Martian, he seemed, with the large hairless head
 of the red planet, and the clean features of an earthman. His eyes,
 behind their glasses, were like green ice, and the hand pouring the
 black fluid did not so much as waver at Ranson's entrance.


 Ranson gasped. The bizarre figure was that of Dr. Elath Taen,
 master-scientist, sought by the T.I. for years, in vain! Elath Taen,
 outlaw and renegade, whose sole desire was the extermination of all
 terrestials on Mars, a revival of the ancient glories of the red
 planet. The tales told about him were fabulous; and this was the man
 behind the unholy music!


 ""Good evening, Mr. Ranson,"" Elath Taen smiled. ""Had I known T.I.
 men were on Mars I should have taken infinitely more precautions.
 However....""


 As he spoke, his hand moved suddenly, as though to hurl the test tube
 at Ranson. Quick as he was, the T.I. man was quicker. A spurt of
 flame leapt from his gun, shattering the tube. The dark liquid hissed,
 smoking, on to the floor.


 ""Well done, Mr. Ranson."" Elath Taen nodded calmly. ""Had the acid struck
 you, it would have rendered you blind.""


 ""That's about enough of your tricks!"" Ranson grated. ""Come along, Dr.
 Taen! We're going to headquarters!""


 ""Since you insist."" Elath Taen removed his chemist's smock, began, very
 deliberately, to strip off his rubber gloves.


 ""Quit stalling!"" Ranson snapped. ""Get going! I...."" The words faded on
 the T.I. man's lips. Faintly, in the distance, came the strains of
 soft eerie music!


 ""Good God!"" Ranson's eyes darted about the laboratory. ""That ... that's
 the same as Haller and I....""


 ""Exactly, Mr. Ranson."" Elath Taen smiled thinly. ""Listen!""


 The music was a caress, soft as a woman's skin. Slow, drowsy, like
 the hum of bees on a hot summer's afternoon. Soothing, soporific, in
 dreamy, crooning chords. A lullaby, that seemed to hang lead weights
 upon the eyelids. Audible hypnotism, as potent as some drug. Clearer
 with each second, the melody grew, coming nearer and nearer the
 laboratory.


 ""Come ... come on,"" Ranson said thickly. ""Got to get out of here.""


 But his words held no force, and Elath Taen was nodding sleepily under
 the influence of the weird dream-music. Ranson knew he should act,
 swiftly, while he could; but the movement of a single muscle seemed
 an intolerable effort. His skin felt as though it were being rubbed
 with velvet, a strange purring sensation filled his brain. He tried to
 think, to move, but his will seemed in a padded vise. The music was
 dragging him down, down, into the gray mists of oblivion.


 Across the laboratory Elath Taen had slumped to the floor, a vague
 smile of triumph on his face. Ranson turned to the direction of
 the music, tried to raise his gun, but the weapon slipped from his
 fingers, he fell to his knees. Sleep ... that was all that mattered ...
 sleep. The music was like chloroform, its notes stroked his brain.
 Through half-shut eyes he saw a door at the rear of the laboratory
 open, saw a slim, dark, exotic girl step through into the room. Slung
 about her neck in the manner of an accordian, was a square box, with
 keys studding its top. For a long moment Ranson stared at the dark,
 enigmatic girl, watched her hands dance over the keys to produce the
 soft lulling music. About her head, he noticed, was a queer copper
 helmet, of a type he had never before seen. And then the girl, Elath
 Taen, the laboratory, all faded into a kaleidoscopic whirl. Ranson felt
 himself falling down into the gray mists, and consciousness disappeared.

There couldn't be a better
 
tip-off system than mine—it
 
wasn't possible—but he had one!

I wouldn't take five cents off a legitimate man, but if they want to
 gamble that's another story.


 What I am is a genius, and I give you a piece of advice: Do not ever
 play cards with a stranger. The stranger might be me. Where there are
 degenerate card players around, I sometimes get a call. Not dice—I
 don't have a machine to handle them. But with cards I have a machine to
 force the advantage.


 The first thing is a little radio receiver, about the size of a pack
 of cigarettes. You don't hear any music. You feel it on your skin. The
 next thing is two dimes. You stick them onto you, anywhere you like.
 Some like to put them on their legs, some on their belly. Makes no
 difference, just so they're out of sight. Each dime has a wire soldered
 to it, and the wires are attached to the little receiver that goes in
 your pocket.


 The other thing is the transmitter I carry around.


 My partner was a fellow named Henry. He had an electronic surplus
 hardware business, but business wasn't good and he was looking for
 a little extra cash on the side. It turns out that the other little
 wholesalers in the loft building where he has his business are all
 card players, and no pikers, either. So Henry spread the word that
 he was available for a gin game—any time at all, but he would only
 play in his own place—he was expecting an important phone call and he
 didn't want to be away and maybe miss it.... It never came; but the
 card players did.


 I was supposed to be his stock clerk. While Henry and the other fellow
 were working on the cards at one end of the room, I would be moving
 around the other—checking the stock, packing the stuff for shipment,
 arranging it on the shelves, sweeping the floor. I was a regular model
 worker, busy every second. I had to be. In order to see the man's
 hand I had to be nearby, but I had to keep moving so he wouldn't pay
 attention to me.


 And every time I got a look at his hand, I pushed the little button on
 the transmitter in my pocket.


 Every push on the button was a shock on Henry's leg. One for spades,
 two for hearts, three for diamonds, four for clubs.


 Then I would tip the card: a short shock for an ace, two for a king,
 three for a queen, and so on down to the ten. A long and a short
 for nine, a long and two shorts for an eight ... it took a little
 memorizing, but it was worth it. Henry knew every card the other man
 held every time. And I got fifty per cent.
We didn't annihilate the fish. They hardly felt they were being hurt,
 but we got a steady advantage, day after day. We did so well we took on
 another man—I can take physical labor or leave it alone, and I leave
 it alone every chance I get.


 That was where we first felt the trouble.


 Our new boy was around twenty. He had a swept-wing haircut, complete
 with tail fins. Also he had a silly laugh. Now, there are jokes in a
 card game—somebody taking a beating will sound off, to take away some
 of the sting, but nobody laughs because the cracks are never funny. But
 they were to our new boy.


 He laughed.


 He laughed not only when the mark made some crack, but a lot of the
 time when he didn't. It got so the customers were looking at him with a
 lot of dislike, and that was bad for business.


 So I called him out into the hall. ""Skippy,"" I said—that's what we
 called him, ""lay off.
Never
rub it in to a sucker. It's enough to
 take his money.""


 He ran his fingers back along his hair. ""Can't a fellow express
 himself?""


 I gave him a long, hard unhealthy look.
Express
himself? He wouldn't
 have to. I'd express him myself—express him right out of our setup.


 But before I got a chance, this fellow from Chicago came in, a big
 manufacturer named Chapo; a wheel, and he looked it. He was red-faced,
 with hanging jowls and a big dollar cigar; he announced that he only
 played for big stakes ... and, nodding toward the kid and me, that he
 didn't like an audience.


 Henry looked at us miserably. But what was he going to do? If he didn't
 go along, the word could spread that maybe there was something wrong
 going on. He had to play. ""Take the day off, you two,"" he said, but he
 wasn't happy.


 I thought fast.


 There was still one chance. I got behind Chapo long enough to give
 Henry a wink and a nod toward the window. Then I took Skippy by the
 elbow and steered him out of there.


 Down in the street I said, fast: ""You want to earn your pay? You have
 to give me a hand—an eye is really what I mean. Don't argue—just say
 yes or no.""


 He didn't stop to think. ""Sure,"" he said. ""Why not?""


 ""All right."" I took him down the street to where they had genuine
 imported Japanese field glasses and laid out twenty bucks for a pair.
 The man was a thief, but I didn't have time to argue. Right across the
 street from Henry's place was a rundown hotel. That was our next stop.


 The desk man in the scratch house looked up from his comic book. ""A
 room,"" I said. ""Me and my nephew want a room facing the street."" And I
 pointed to the window of Henry's place, where I wanted it to face.


 Because we still had a chance. With the field glasses and Skippy's
 young, good eyes to look through them, with the transmitter that would
 carry an extra hundred yards easy enough—with everything going for us,
 we had a chance. Provided Henry had been able to maneuver Chapo so his
 back was to the window.


 The bed merchant gave us a long stall about how the only room we wanted
 belonged to a sweet old lady that was sick and couldn't be moved. But
 for ten bucks she could be.


 All the time I was wondering how many hands were being played, if we
 were stuck money and how much—all kinds of things. But finally we
 got into the room and I laid it out for Skippy. ""You aim those field
 glasses out the window,"" I told him. ""Read Chapo's cards and let me
 know; that's all. I'll take care of the rest.""


 I'll say this for him, duck-tail haircut and all, he settled right
 down to business. I made myself comfortable on the bed and rattled them
 off on the transmitter as he read the cards to me. I couldn't see the
 players, didn't know the score; but if he was giving the cards to me
 right, I was getting them out to Henry.
I felt pretty good. I even began to feel kindly toward the kid. At my
 age, bifocals are standard equipment, but to judge from Skippy's fast,
 sure call of the cards, his eyesight was twenty-twenty or better.


 After about an hour, Skippy put down the glasses and broke the news:
 the game was over.


 We took our time getting back to Henry's place, so Chapo would have
 time to clear out. Henry greeted us with eight fingers in the air.


 Eight hundred? But before I could ask him, he was already talking:
 ""Eight big ones! Eight thousand bucks! And how you did it, I'll never
 know!""


 Well, eight thousand was good news, no doubt of that. I said, ""That's
 the old system, Henry. But we couldn't have done it if you hadn't
 steered the fish up to the window."" And I showed him the Japanese field
 glasses, grinning.


 But he didn't grin back. He looked puzzled. He glanced toward the
 window.


 I looked too, and then I saw what he was puzzled about. It was pretty
 obvious that Henry had missed my signal. He and the fish had played by
 the window, all right.


 But the shade was down.
When I turned around to look for Skippy, to ask him some questions, he
 was gone. Evidently he didn't want to answer.


 I beat up and down every block in the neighborhood until I spotted him
 in a beanery, drinking a cup of coffee and looking worried.


 I sat down beside him, quiet. He didn't look around. The counterman
 opened his mouth to say hello. I shook my head, but Skippy said,
 ""That's all right. I know you're there.""


 I blinked. This was a creep! But I had to find out what was going on. I
 said, ""You made a mistake, kid.""


 ""Running out?"" He shrugged. ""It's not the first mistake I made,"" he
 said bitterly. ""Getting into your little setup with the bugged game
 came before that.""


 I said, ""You can always quit,"" but then stopped. Because it was a lie.
 He couldn't quit—not until I found out how he read Chapo's cards
 through a drawn shade.


 He said drearily, ""You've all got me marked lousy, haven't you? Don't
 kid me about Henry—I know. I'm not so sure about you, but it wouldn't
 surprise me.""


 ""What are you talking about?""


 ""I can hear every word that's on Henry's mind,"" he said somberly.
 ""You, no. Some people I can hear, some I can't; you're one I can't.""


 ""What kind of goofy talk is that?"" I demanded. But, to tell you the
 truth, I didn't think it was so goofy. The window shade was a lot
 goofier.


 ""All my life,"" said Skippy, ""I've been hearing the voices. It doesn't
 matter if they talk out loud or not. Most people I can hear, even when
 they don't want me to. Field glasses? I didn't need field glasses. I
 could hear every thought that went through Chapo's mind, clear across
 the street. Henry too. That's how I know."" He hesitated, looking at me.
 ""You think Henry took eight thousand off Chapo, don't you? It was ten.""


 I said, ""Prove it.""


 The kid finished his coffee. ""Well,"" he said, ""you want to know what
 the counterman's got on his mind?"" He leaned over and whispered to me.


 I yelled, ""That's a lousy thing to say!""


 Everybody was looking at us. He said softly, ""You see what it's like? I
 don't want to hear all this stuff! You think the counterman's got a bad
 mind, you ought to listen in on Henry's."" He looked along the stools.
 ""See that fat little woman down at the end? She's going to order
 another cheese Danish.""


 He hadn't even finished talking when the woman was calling the
 counterman, and she got another cheese Danish. I thought it over. What
 he said about Henry holding out on me made it real serious. I had to
 have more proof.


 But I didn't like Skippy's idea of proof. He offered to call off what
 everybody in the beanery was going to do next, barring three or four he
 said were silent, like me. That wasn't good enough. ""Come along with
 me,"" I told him, and we took off for Jake's spot.


 That's a twenty-four-hour place and the doorman knows me. I knew Jake
 and I knew his roulette wheel was gaffed. I walked right up to the
 wheel, and whispered to the kid, ""Can you read the dealer?"" He smiled
 and nodded. ""All right. Call black or red.""


 The wheel spun, but that didn't stop the betting. Jake's hungry. In
 his place you can still bet for a few seconds after the wheel starts
 turning.


 ""Black,"" Skippy said.


 I threw down fifty bucks. Black it was.


 That rattled me.


 ""Call again,"" I said.


 When Skippy said black, I put the fifty on red. Black won it.


 ""Let's go,"" I said, and led the kid out of there.


 He was looking puzzled. ""How come—""


 ""How come I played to lose?"" I patted his shoulder. ""Sonny, you got a
 lot to learn. Jake's is no fair game. This was only a dry run.""


 Then I got rid of him, because I had something to do.
Henry came across. He even looked embarrassed. ""I figured,"" he said,
 ""uh, I figured that the expenses—""


 ""Save it,"" I told him. ""All I want is my split.""


 He handed it over, but I kept my hand out, waiting. After a minute he
 got the idea. He reached down inside the waistband of his pants, pulled
 loose the tape that held the dimes to his skin and handed over the
 radio receiver. ""That's it, huh?"" he said.


 ""That's it.""


 ""Take your best shot,"" he said glumly. ""But mark my words. You're not
 going to make out on your own.""


 ""I won't be on my own,"" I told him, and left him then. By myself? Not
 a chance! It was going to be Skippy and me, all the way. Not only
 could he read minds, but the capper was that he couldn't read mine!
 Otherwise, you can understand, I might not want him around all the time.


 But this way I had my own personal bug in every game in town, and I
 didn't even have to spend for batteries. Card games, gaffed wheels,
 everything. Down at the track he could follow the smart-money guys
 around and let me know what they knew, which was plenty. We could even
 go up against the legit games in Nevada, with no worry about bluffs.


 And think of the fringe benefits! With Skippy giving the women a
 preliminary screening, I could save a lot of wasted time. At my age,
 time is nothing to be wasted.


 I could understand a lot about Skippy now—why he didn't like most
 people, why he laughed at jokes nobody else thought were funny, or even
 could hear. But everybody has got to like somebody, and I had the edge
 over most of the human race. He didn't know what I was thinking.


 And then, take away the voices in his head, and Skippy didn't have much
 left. He wasn't very smart. If he had half as much in the way of brains
 as he did in the way of private radar, he would have figured all these
 angles out for himself long ago. No, he needed me. And I needed him.
 We were all set to make a big score together, so I went back to his
 rooming house where I'd told him to wait, to get going on the big time.


 However, Henry had more brains than Skippy.


 I hadn't told Henry who tipped me off, but it didn't take him long to
 work out. After all, I had told him I was going out to look for Skippy,
 and I came right back and called him for holding out. No, it didn't
 take much brains. All he had to do was come around to Skippy's place
 and give him a little lesson about talking.


 So when I walked in the door, Skippy was there, but he was out cold,
 with lumps on his forehead and a stupid grin on his face. I woke him up
 and he recognized me.


 But you don't make your TV set play better by kicking it. You don't
 help a fine Swiss watch by pounding it on an anvil. Skippy could walk
 and talk all right, but something was missing. ""The voices!"" he yelled,
 sitting up on the edge of the bed.


 I got a quick attack of cold fear. ""Skippy! What's the matter? Don't
 you hear them any more?""


 He looked at me in a panic. ""Oh, I hear them all right. But they're all
 different now. I mean—it isn't English any more. In fact, it isn't any
 language at all!""
Like I say, I'm a genius. Skippy wouldn't lie to me; he's not smart
 enough. If he says he hears voices, he hears voices.


 Being a genius, my theory is that when Henry worked Skippy over, he
 jarred his tuning strips, or whatever it is, so now Skippy's receiving
 on another frequency. Make sense? I'm positive about it. He sticks to
 the same story, telling me about what he's hearing inside his head, and
 he's too stupid to make it all up.


 There are some parts of it I don't have all figured out yet, but I'll
 get them. Like what he tells me about the people—I
guess
they're
 people—whose voices he hears. They're skinny and furry and very
 religious. He can't understand their language, but he gets pictures
 from them, and he told me what he saw. They worship the Moon, he says.
 Only that's wrong too, because he says they worship two moons, and
 everybody knows there's only one. But I'll figure it out; I have to,
 because I have to get Skippy back in business.


 Meanwhile it's pretty lonesome. I spend a lot of time down around the
 old neighborhood, but I haven't set up another partner for taking the
 card players. That seems like pretty small stuff now. And I don't talk
 to Henry when I see him. And I
never
go in the beanery when that
 counterman is on duty. I've got enough troubles in the world; I don't
 have to add to them by associating with
his
kind.

         I love beer, but lately I've been wondering: Am I getting full value for my beer dollar? As I've stocked up on microbrews and fancy imports, I've told myself that their taste is deeper, richer, more complicated, more compelling--and therefore worth the 50 percent to 200 percent premium they command over cheap mass products or even mainstream Bud. And yet, I've started to wonder, is this just costly snobbery? If I didn't know what I was drinking, could I even tell whether it was something from Belgium, vs. something from Pabst? 

         I'm afraid we'll never know the answer to that exact question, since I'm not brave enough to expose my own taste to a real test. But I'm brave enough to expose my friends'. This summer, while working at Microsoft, I put out a call for volunteers for a ""science of beer"" experiment. Testing candidates had to meet two criteria: 1) they had to like beer; and 2) they had to think they knew the difference between mass products and high-end microbrews. 

         Twelve tasters were selected, mainly on the basis of essays detailing their background with beer. A few were selected because they had been bosses in the Microsoft department where I worked. All were software managers or developers ; all were male, but I repeat myself. Nearly half had grown up outside the United States or lived abroad for enough years to speak haughtily about American macrobrews. Most tasters came in talking big about the refinement of their palates. When they entered the laboratory (which mere moments before had been a Microsoft conference room), they discovered an experiment set up on the following lines: 

         1 Philosophy                : The experiment was designed to take place in two separate sessions. The first session, whose results are revealed here, involved beers exclusively from the lager group. Lagers are the light-colored, relatively lightly flavored brews that make up most of the vattage of beer consumption in the United States. Imported lagers include Foster's, Corona, and Heineken. Budweiser is a lager; so are Coors, Miller, most light beers, and most bargain-basement beers. 

         Beer snobs sneer at lagers, because they look so watery and because so many bad beers are in the group. But the lager test came first, for two reasons. One, lagers pose the only honest test of the ability to tell expensive from dirt-cheap beers. There are very few inexpensive nut brown ales, India pale ales, extra special bitters, or other fancy-pantsy, microbrew-style, nonlager drinks. So if you want to see whether people can taste a money difference among beers of the same type, you've got to go lager. Two, the ideal of public service requires lager coverage. This is what most people drink, so new findings about lager quality could do the greatest good for the greatest number. 

         In the second stage of the experiment, held several weeks later, the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers. The results of that tasting will be reported separately, once Microsoft's mighty Windows 2000-powered central computers have . 

         2 Materials                : Ten lagers were selected for testing, representing three distinct price-and-quality groups. Through the magic of the market, it turns out that lager prices nearly all fall into one of three ranges: 

         a) High end at $1.50 to $1.60 per pint. (""Per pint"" was the unit-pricing measure at the Safeway in Bellevue, Wash., that was the standard supply source for the experiment. There are 4.5 pints per six pack, so the high-end price point is around $7 per six pack.) 

         b) Middle at around 80 cents per pint, or under $4 per six pack. 

         c) Low at 50 cents to 55 cents per pint, or under $3 per six pack. 

         The neat 6:3:2 mathematical relationship among the price groups should be noted. The high-end beers cost roughly three times as much as the cheapest ones, and twice as much as the middle range. The beers used in the experiment were as follows: 

                         High End              

                         Grolsch. Import lager (Holland). $1.67 per pint. (See an important .) Chosen for the test because of its beer-snob chic; also, one of my favorite beers. 

                         Heineken. Import lager (Holland). $1.53 per pint. (Sale price. List price was $1.71 per pint.) Chosen because it is America's long-standing most popular import. 

                         Pete's Wicked Lager. National-scale ""microbrew."" $1.11 per pint. (Deep-discount sale. List price $1.46 per pint.) Like the next one, this put us into the gray zone for a lager test. Few American ""microbreweries"" produce lagers of any sort. Pete's is called a lager but was visibly darker than, say, Bud. 

                         Samuel Adams Boston Lager. National macro-microbrew. $1.56 per pint. (That was list price. The following week it was on sale for $1.25 per pint, which would have made it do far better in the value rankings.) Calls itself America's Best Beer. Has dark orangey-amber color that was obviously different from all other lagers tested. 

                         Mid-Range              

                         Budweiser. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) Self-styled King of Beers. 

                         Miller Genuine Draft. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) 

                         Coors Light. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint. Isn't price competition a wonderful thing?) The Silver Bullet That Won't Slow You Down. 

                         Cheap              

                         Milwaukee's Best. $.55 per pint. (Sale. List price $.62 per pint.) A k a ""Beast."" 

                         Schmidt's. $.54 per pint. (Sale. List $.62 per pint.) Box decorated with a nice painting of a trout. 

                         Busch. $.50 per pint. (Sale. List $.69 per pint.) Painting of mountains. 

         The Safeway that supplied the beers didn't carry any true bargain-basement products, such as ""Red, White, and Blue,"" ""Old German,"" or the one with generic printing that just says ""Beer."" The experiment was incomplete in that regard, but no tester complained about a shortage of bad beer. Also, with heavy heart, the test administrator decided to leave malt liquors, such as Mickey's (with its trademark wide-mouth bottles), off the list. They have the air of cheapness but actually cost more than Bud, probably because they offer more alcohol per pint. 

         3 Experimental                 procedure: Each taster sat down before an array of 10 plastic cups labeled A through J. The A-to-J coding scheme was the same for all tasters. Each cup held 3 ounces of one of the sample beers. (Total intake, for a taster who drank all of every sample: 30 ounces, or two and a half normal beers. Not lethal; also, they were just going back to software coding when they were done.) Saltines were available to cleanse the palate. The cups were red opaque plastic, so tasters could judge the beer's color only from above. There was no time limit for the tasting, apart from the two-hour limit in which we had reserved the conference room. One experimenter (the boss of most of the others there) rushed through his rankings in 10 minutes and gave the lowest overall scores. The taster who took the longest, nearly the full two hours, had the ratings that came closest to the relative price of the beers. (This man grew up in Russia.) The experimenters were asked not to compare impressions until the test was over. 

         After tasting the beers, each taster rated beers A through J on the following standards: 

                         Overall quality points: Zero to 100, zero as undrinkable and 100 as dream beer. Purely subjective measure of how well each taster liked each beer. 

                         Price category: The tasters knew that each beer came from the expensive, medium, or cheap category--and they had to guess where A through J belonged. A rating of 3 was most expensive, 2 for average, 1 for cheap. 

                         Description: ""Amusing presumption,"" ""fresh on the palate,"" ""crap,"" etc. 

                         Best and Worst: Tasters chose one Best and one Worst from the ""flight"" (as they would call it if this were a wine test). 

         When the session was over, results for each beer were collected in a grid like this: 

           

         To see all the grids for all the beers, click . 

         4 Data                 Analysis: The ratings led to four ways to assess the quality of the beers. 

                         1. Best and Worst. Least scientific, yet clearest cut in its results. Eleven tasters named a favorite beer. Ten of them chose Sam Adams . The other one chose Busch , the cheapest of all beers in the sample. (The taster who made this choice advises Microsoft on what new features should go into the next version of Word.) Busch was the only beer to receive both a Best and a Worst vote. 

         Bottom rankings were also clear. Of the 11 naming a Worst beer, five chose Grolsch , the most expensive beer in the survey. Results by best/worst preference: 

           

                         2. Overall                 preference points                . This was a subtler and more illuminating look at similar trends. The beers were ranked on ""corrected average preference points""--an average of the zero-to-100 points assigned by each taster, corrected, just like ice skating scores, by throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. The tasters used widely varying scales--one confining all beers to the range between zero and 30, another giving 67 as his lowest mark. But the power of our corrected ranking system surmounted such difficulties to provide these results: 

           

         Here again one costly beer-- Sam Adams --shows up well, while another, Grolsch , continues to struggle, but not as badly as the medium-price Miller Genuine Draft . Sam's success could reflect its quasi-mislabeling, presenting a strong-flavored beer as a ""lager."" It could also reflect that participants simply thought it was good. (Only one guessed it was Sam Adams.) As for Grolsch ... it is very strongly hopped, which can seem exotic if you know you're drinking a pricey import but simply bad if you don't. MGD overtook Grolsch in the race for the bottom because, while many people hated Grolsch, some actually liked it; no one liked MGD. There are some other important findings buried in the chart, but they're clearest if we move to ... 

         3) Value for Money: the Taste-o-meter® . Since this experiment's real purpose was to find the connection between cost and taste, the next step was to adjust subjective preference points by objective cost. The Taste-o-meter rating for each beer was calculated by dividing its corrected average preference rating by its price per pint . If Beer X had ratings twice as high as Beer Y, but it cost three times as much, Beer Y would have the higher Taste-o-meter rating. When the 10 beers are reranked this way, the results are: 

           

         In a familiar pattern, we have Grolsch bringing up the rear, with less than one-quarter the Taste-o-meter power of Busch , the No. 1 value beer. The real news in this ranking is: the success of Busch ; the embarrassment of Heineken and Miller Genuine Draft , an expensive and a medium beer, respectively, which share the cellar with the hapless Grolsch ; and the nearly Busch-like value of Milwaukee's Best and Schmidt's . It is safe to say that none of our testers would have confessed respect for Busch, Milwaukee's Best, or Schmidt's before the contest began. But when they didn't know what they were drinking, they found these beers much closer in quality to ""best"" beers than the prices would indicate. 

                         4) Social Value for Money: the Snob-o-meter® . In addition to saying which beers they preferred, the tasters were asked to estimate whether the beers were expensive or not--in effect, to judge whether other people would like and be impressed by the beers. One taster perfectly understood the intention of this measure when he said, in comments about Beer B (Heineken), ""I don't like it, but I bet it's what the snobs buy."" The Snob-o-meter rating for each beer is similar to the Taste-o-meter. You start with the ""group"" ranking--whether the tasters thought the beer belonged in Group 1 (cheap), 2, or 3--and then divide by the price per pint. The result tells you the social-mobility power of the beer--how impressive it will seem, relative to how much it costs. The Snob-o-meter rankings are: 

           

         We won't even speak of poor Grolsch or MGD any more. The story here is the amazing snob-power-per-dollar of Busch , closely followed by Schmidt's . A dollar spent on Busch gets you three times the impressiveness of a dollar spent in Grolsch, useful information when planning a party. Not everyone liked Busch--one called it ""crap""; another, ""Water. LITE."" But the magic of statistics lets us see the larger trends. 

          5 Conclusions                . Further study is needed. But on the basis of evidence to date, we can say: 

          

            One and only one beer truly survived the blind taste test. This is Sam Adams , which 10 tasters independently ranked ""best"" without knowing they were drinking a fancy beer. (They knew it was darker than the others but couldn't have known whether this was some trick off-brand sneaked into the test.) 

            Don't serve Grolsch unless you know people will consider it exotic, or unless you've invited me. 

            Apart from Sam Adams and Grolsch, the tasters really had trouble telling one beer from another . This conclusion is implicit in many of the findings, but it was really obvious during the experiment itself, when the confident look of men-who-know-their-beer quickly turned to dismay and panic as they realized that all the lagers tasted pretty much the same. 

          

         The evidence suggests other implications about specific beers. For instance, the comments about Coors Light are much less enthusiastic than the average-or-better numerical rankings. Most tasters paused to complain about it--""fizzy and soapy""--before giving it reasonable marks. But the main implication, and the most useful consumer news from this study, is a radically simplified buying philosophy for lager beers. Based on this study, rational consumers should: 

         1) Buy Sam Adams when they want an individual glass of lager to be as good as it can be. 

         2) Buy Busch at all other times, since it gives them the maximum taste and social influence per dollar invested. 

         The detailed rankings and comments for all tasters on all beers may be found .

Two men had died before Syme Rector's guns

 to give him the key to the ancient city of

 Kal-Jmar—a city of untold wealth, and of

 robots that made desires instant commands.

The tall man loitered a moment before a garish window display, his eyes
 impassive in his space-burned face, as the Lillis patrolman passed.
 Then he turned, burying his long chin in the folds of his sand cape,
 and took up the pursuit of the dark figure ahead once more.


 Above, the city's multicolored lights were reflected from the
 translucent Dome—a distant, subtly distorted Lillis, through which the
 stars shone dimly.


 Getting through that dome had been his first urgent problem, but now he
 had another, and a more pressing one. It had been simple enough to pass
 himself off as an itinerant prospector and gain entrance to the city,
 after his ship had crashed in the Mare Cimmerium. But the rest would
 not be so simple. He had to acquire a spaceman's identity card, and he
 had to do it fast. It was only a matter of time until the Triplanet
 Patrol gave up the misleading trail he had made into the hill country,
 and concluded that he must have reached Lillis. After that, his only
 safety lay in shipping out on a freighter as soon as possible. He had
 to get off Mars, because his trail was warm, and the Patrol thorough.


 They knew, of course, that he was an outlaw—the very fact of the
 crashed, illegally-armed ship would have told them that. But they
 didn't know that he was Syme Rector, the most-wanted and most-feared
 raider in the System. In that was his only advantage.


 He walked a little faster, as his quarry turned up a side street and
 then boarded a moving ramp to an upper level. He watched until the
 short, wide-shouldered figure in spaceman's harness disappeared over
 the top of the ramp, and then followed.


 The man was waiting for him at the mouth of the ascending tunnel.


 Syme looked at him casually, without a flicker of expression, and
 started to walk on, but the other stepped into his path. He was quite
 young, Syme saw, with a fighter's shoulders under the white leather,
 and a hard, determined thrust to his firm jaw.


 ""All right,"" the boy said quietly. ""What is it?""


 ""I don't understand,"" Syme said.


 ""The game, the angle. You've been following me. Do you want trouble?""


 ""Why, no,"" Syme told him bewilderedly. ""I haven't been following you.
 I—""


 The boy knuckled his chin reflectively. ""You could be lying,"" he said
 finally. ""But maybe I've made a mistake."" Then—""Okay, citizen, you can
 clear—but don't let me catch you on my tail again.""


 Syme murmured something and turned away, feeling the spaceman's eyes
 on the small of his back until he turned the corner. At the next
 street he took a ramp up, crossed over and came down on the other side
 a block away. He waited until he saw the boy's broad figure pass the
 intersection, and then followed again more cautiously.


 It was risky, but there was no other way. The signatures, the data,
 even the photograph on the card could be forged once Syme got his hands
 on it, but the identity card itself—that oblong of dark diamondite,
 glowing with the tiny fires of radioactivity—that could not be
 imitated, and the only way to get it was to kill.


 Up ahead was the Founders' Tower, the tallest building in Lillis. The
 boy strode into the entrance lobby, bought a ticket for the observation
 platform, and took the elevator. As soon as his car was out of sight in
 the transparent tube, Syme followed. He put a half-credit slug into the
 machine, took the punctured slip of plastic that came out. The ticket
 went into a scanning slot in the wall of the car, and the elevator
 whisked him up.
The tower was high, more than a hundred meters above the highest level
 of the city, and the curved dome that kept air in Lillis was close
 overhead. Syme looked up, after his first appraising glance about the
 platform, and saw the bright-blue pinpoint of Earth. The sight stirred
 a touch of nostalgia in him, as it always did, but he put it aside.


 The boy was hunched over the circular balustrade a little distance
 away. Except for him, the platform was empty. Syme loosened his slim,
 deadly energy pistol in its holster and padded catlike toward the
 silent figure.


 It was over in a minute. The boy whirled as he came up, warned by
 some slight sound, or by the breath of Syme's passage in the still
 air. He opened his mouth to shout, and brought up his arm in a swift,
 instinctive gesture. But the blow never landed. Syme's pistol spat its
 silent white pencil of flame, and the boy crumpled to the floor with a
 minute, charred hole in the white leather over his chest.
Syme stooped over him swiftly, found a thick wallet and thrust it into
 his pocket without a second glance. Then he raised the body in his arms
 and thrust it over the parapet.


 It fell, and in the same instant Syme felt a violent tug at his wrist.
 Before he could move to stop himself, he was over the edge. Too late,
 he realized what had happened—one of the hooks on the dead spaceman's
 harness had caught the heavy wristband of his chronometer. He was
 falling, linked to the body of his victim!


 Hardly knowing what he did, he lashed out wildly with his other arm,
 felt his fingertips catch and bite into the edge of the balustrade. His
 body hit the wall of the tower with a thump, and, a second later, the
 corpse below him hit the wall. Then they both hung there, swaying a
 little and Syme's fingers slipped a little with each motion.


 Gritting his teeth, he brought the magnificent muscles of his arm into
 play, raising the forearm against the dead weight of the dangling body.
 Fraction by slow fraction of an inch, it came up. Syme could feel the
 sweat pouring from his brow, running saltily into his eyes. His arms
 felt as if they were being torn from their sockets. Then the hook
 slipped free, and the tearing, unbearable weight vanished.


 The reaction swung Syme against the building again, and he almost
 lost his slippery hold on the balustrade. After a moment he heard the
 spaceman's body strike with a squashy thud, somewhere below.


 He swung up his other arm, got a better grip on the balustrade. He
 tried cautiously to get a leg up, but the motion loosened his hold on
 the smooth surface again. He relaxed, thinking furiously. He could hold
 on for another minute at most; then it was the final blast-off.


 He heard running footsteps, and then a pale face peered over the ledge
 at him. He realized suddenly that the whole incident could have taken
 only a few seconds. He croaked, ""Get me up.""


 Wordlessly, the man clasped thin fingers around his wrist. The other
 pulled, with much puffing and panting, and with his help Syme managed
 to get a leg over the edge and hoist his trembling body to safety.


 ""Are you all right?""
Syme looked at the man, nursing the tortured muscles of his arms. His
 rescuer was tall and thin, of indeterminate age. He had light, sandy
 hair, a sharp nose, and—oddly conflicting—pale, serious eyes and a
 humorous wide mouth. He was still panting.


 ""I'm not hurt,"" Syme said. He grinned, his white teeth flashing in his
 dark, lean face. ""Thanks for giving me a hand.""


 ""You scared hell out of me,"" said the man. ""I heard a thud. I
 thought—you'd gone over."" He looked at Syme questioningly.


 ""That was my bag,"" the outlaw said quickly. ""It slipped out of my hand,
 and I overbalanced myself when I grabbed for it.""


 The man sighed. ""I need a drink.
You
need a drink. Come on."" He
 picked up a small black suitcase from the floor and started for the
 elevator, then stopped. ""Oh—your bag. Shouldn't we do something about
 that?""


 ""Never mind,"" said Syme, taking his arm. ""The shock must have busted it
 wide open. My laundry is probably all over Lillis by now.""


 They got off at the amusement level, three tiers down, and found a
 cafe around the corner. Syme wasn't worried about the man he had just
 killed. He had heard no second thud, so the body must have stayed on
 the first outcropping of the tower it struck. It probably wouldn't be
 found until morning.


 And he had the wallet. When he paid for the first round of
culcha
, he
 took it out and stole a glance at the identification card inside. There
 it was—his ticket to freedom. He began feeling expansive, and even
 friendly toward the slender, mouse-like man across the table. It was
 the
culcha
, of course. He knew it, and didn't care. In the morning
 he'd find a freighter berth—in as big a spaceport as Lillis, there
 were always jobs open. Meanwhile, he might as well enjoy himself, and
 it was safer to be seen with a companion than to be alone.


 He listened lazily to what the other was saying, leaning his tall,
 graceful body back into the softly-cushioned seat.


 ""Lissen,"" said Harold Tate. He leaned forward on one elbow, slipped,
 caught himself, and looked at the elbow reproachfully. ""Lissen,"" he
 said again, ""I trust you, Jones. You're obvi-obviously an adventurer,
 but you have an honest face. I can't see it very well at the moment,
 but I hic!—pardon—seem to recall it as an honest face. I'm going to
 tell you something, because I need your help!—help."" He paused. ""I
 need a guide. D'you know this part of Mars well?""


 ""Sure,"" said Syme absently. Out in the center of the floor, an AG
 plate had been turned on. Five Venusian girls were diving and twisting
 in its influence, propelling themselves by the motion of their
 delicately-webbed feet and trailing long gauzy streamers of synthesilk
 after them. Syme watched them through narrowed lids, feeling the glow
 of
culcha
inside him.


 ""I wanta go to Kal-Jmar,"" said Tate.


 Syme snapped to attention, every nerve tingling. An indefinable sense,
 a hunch that had served him well before, told him that something big
 was coming—something that promised adventure and loot for Syme Rector.
 ""Why?"" he asked softly. ""Why to Kal-Jmar?""


 Harold Tate told him, and later, when Syme had taken him to his rooms,
 he showed him what was in his little black suitcase. Syme had been
 right; it was big.
Kal-Jmar was the riddle of the Solar System. It was the only remaining
 city of the ancient Martian race—the race that, legends said, had
 risen to greater heights than any other Solar culture. The machines,
 the artifacts, the records of the Martians were all there, perfectly
 preserved inside the city's bubble-like dome, after God knew how many
 thousands of years. But they couldn't be reached.


 For Kal-Jmar's dome was not the thing of steelite that protected
 Lillis: it was a tenuous, globular field of force that defied analysis
 as it defied explosives and diamond drills. The field extended both
 above and below the ground, and tunneling was of no avail. No one knew
 what had happened to the Martians, whether they were the ancestors of
 the present decadent Martian race, or a different species. No one knew
 anything about them or about Kal-Jmar.


 In the early days, when the conquest of Mars was just beginning, Earth
 scientists had been wild to get into the city. They had observed it
 from every angle, taken photographs of its architecture and the robots
 that still patrolled its fantastically winding streets, and then they
 had tried everything they knew to pierce the wall.


 Later, however, when every unsuccessful attempt had precipitated a
 bloody uprising of the present-day Martians—resulting in a rapid
 dwindling of the number of Martians—the Mars Protectorate had stepped
 in and forbidden any further experiments; forbidden, in fact, any
 Earthman to go near the place.


 Thus matter had stood for over a hundred years, until Harold Tate.
 Tate, a physicist, had stumbled on a field that seemed to be identical
 in properties to the Kal-Jmar dome; and what is more, he had found a
 force that would break it down.


 And so he had made his first trip to Mars, and within twenty-four
 hours, by the blindest of chances, blurted out his secret to Syme
 Rector, the scourge of the spaceways, the man with a thousand credits
 on his sleek, tigerish head.


 Syme's smile was not tigerish now; it was carefully, studiedly mild.
 For Tate was no longer drunk, and it was important that it should not
 occur to him that he had been indiscreet.


 ""This is native territory we're coming to, Harold,"" he said. ""Better
 strap on your gun.""


 ""Why. Are they really dangerous?""


 ""They're unpredictable,"" Syme told him. ""They're built differently, and
 they think differently. They breathe like us, down in their caverns
 where there's air, but they also eat sand, and get their oxygen that
 way.""


 ""Yes, I've heard about that,"" Tate said. ""Iron oxide—very interesting
 metabolism."" He got his energy pistol out of the compartment and
 strapped it on absently.


 Syme turned the little sand car up a gentle rise towards the tortuous
 hill country in the distance. ""Not only that,"" he continued. ""They
 eat the damndest stuff. Lichens and fungi and tumble-grass off the
 deserts—all full of deadly poisons, from arsenic up the line to
 xopite. They seem intelligent enough—in their own way—but they never
 come near our cities and they either can't or won't learn Terrestrial.
 When the first colonists came here, they had to learn
their
crazy
 language. Every word of it can mean any one of a dozen different
 things, depending on the inflection you give it. I can speak it some,
 but not much. Nobody can. We don't think the same.""


 ""So you think they might attack us?"" Tate asked again, nervously.


 ""They
might
do anything,"" Syme said curtly. ""Don't worry about it.""


 The hills were much closer than they had seemed, because of Mars'
 deceptively low horizon. In half an hour they were in the midst of a
 wilderness of fantastically eroded dunes and channels, laboring on
 sliding treads up the sides of steep hills only to slither down again
 on the other side.
Syme stopped the car abruptly as a deep, winding channel appeared
 across their path. ""Gully,"" he announced. ""Shall we cross it, or follow
 it?""


 Tate peered through the steelite nose of the car. ""Follow, I guess,""
 he offered. ""It seems to go more or less where we're going, and if we
 cross it we'll only come to a couple dozen more.""


 Syme nodded and moved the sand car up to the edge of the gully. Then he
 pressed a stud on the control board; a metal arm extruded from the tail
 of the car and a heavy spike slowly unscrewed from it, driving deep
 into the sand. A light on the board flashed, indicating that the spike
 was in and would bear the car's weight, and Syme started the car over
 the edge.


 As the little car nosed down into the gully, the metal arm left behind
 revealed itself to be attached to a length of thick, very strong wire
 cable, with a control cord inside. They inched down the almost vertical
 incline, unreeling the cable behind them, and starting minor landslides
 as they descended.


 Finally they touched bottom. Syme pressed another stud, and above, the
 metal spike that had supported them screwed itself out of the ground
 again and the cable reeled in.


 Tate had been watching with interest. ""Very ingenious,"" he said. ""But
 how do we get up again?""


 ""Most of these gullies peter out gradually,"" said Syme, ""but if we want
 or have to climb out where it's deep, we have a little harpoon gun that
 shoots the anchor up on top.""


 ""Good. I shouldn't like to stay down here for the rest of my
 natural life. Depressing view."" He looked up at the narrow strip of
 almost-black sky visible from the floor of the gully, and shook his
 head.


 Neither Syme nor Tate ever had a chance to test the efficiency of their
 harpoon gun. They had traveled no more than five hundred meters, and
 the gully was as deep as ever, when Tate, looking up, saw a deeper
 blackness blot out part of the black sky directly overhead. He shouted,
 ""Look out!"" and grabbed for the nearest steering lever.


 The car wheeled around in a half circle and ran into the wall of the
 gully. Syme was saying, ""What—?"" when there was a thunderous crash
 that shook the sturdy walls of the car, as a huge boulder smashed into
 the ground immediately to their left.


 When the smoky red dust had cleared away, they saw that the left tread
 of the sand car was crushed beyond all recognition.


 Syme was cursing slowly and steadily with a deep, seething anger. Tate
 said, ""I guess we walk from here on."" Then he looked up again and
 caught a glimpse of the horde of beasts that were rushing up the gully
 toward them.


 ""My God!"" he said. ""What are those?""


 Syme looked. ""Those,"" he said bitterly, ""are Martians.""


 The natives, like all Martian fauna, were multi-legged. Also like all
 Martian fauna, they moved so fast that you couldn't see how many legs
 they did have. Actually, however, the natives had six legs apiece—or,
 more properly, four legs and two arms. Their lungs were not as large
 as they appeared, being collapsed at the moment. What caused the bulge
 that made their torsos look like sausages was a huge air bladder, with
 a valve arrangement from the stomach and feeding directly into the
 bloodstream.


 Their faces were vaguely canine, but the foreheads were high, and the
 lips were not split. They did resemble dogs, in that their thick black
 fur was splotched with irregulate patches of white. These patches of
 white were subject to muscular control and could be spread out fanwise;
 or, conversely, the black could be expanded to cover the white, which
 helped to take care of the extremes of Martian temperature. Right now
 they were mostly black.


 The natives slowed down and spread out to surround the wrecked sand
 car, and it could be seen that most of them were armed with spears,
 although some had the slim Benson energy guns—strictly forbidden to
 Martians.


 Syme stopped cursing and watched tensely. Tate said nothing, but he
 swallowed audibly.


 One Martian, who looked exactly like all the rest, stepped forward and
 motioned unmistakably for the two to come out. He waited a moment and
 then gestured with his energy gun. That gun, Syme knew from experience,
 could burn through a small thickness of steelite if held on the same
 spot long enough.
""Come on,"" Syme said grimly. He rose and reached for a pressure suit,
 and Tate followed him.


 ""What do you think they'll—"" he began, and then stopped himself. ""I
 know. They're unpredictable.""


 ""Yeah,"" said Syme, and opened the door. The air in the car
whooshed
into the near-vacuum outside, and he and Tate stepped out.


 The Martian leader looked at them enigmatically, then turned and
 started off. The other natives closed in on them, and they all bounded
 along under the weak gravity.


 They bounded along for what Syme figured as a good kilometer and a
 half, and they then reached a branch in the gully and turned down
 it, going lower all the time. Under the light of their helmet lamps,
 they could see the walls of the gully—a tunnel, now—getting darker
 and more solid. Finally, when Syme estimated they were about nine
 kilometers down, there was even a suggestion of moisture.


 The tunnel debouched at last into a large cavern. There was a
 phosphorescent gleam from fungus along the walls, but Syme couldn't
 decide how far away the far wall was. He noticed something else, though.


 ""There's air here,"" he said to Tate. ""I can see dust motes in it."" He
 switched his helmet microphone from radio over to the audio membrane
 on the outside of the helmet. ""
Kalis methra
,"" he began haltingly,
 ""
seltin guna getal.
""


 ""Yes, there is air here,"" said the Martian leader, startlingly. ""Not
 enough for your use, however, so do not open your helmets.""


 Syme swore amazedly.


 ""I thought you said they didn't speak Terrestrial,"" Tate said. Syme
 ignored him.


 ""We had our reasons for not doing so,"" the Martian said.


 ""But how—?""


 ""We are telepaths, of course. On a planet which is nearly airless on
 its surface, we have to be. A tendency of the Terrestrial mind is to
 ignore the obvious. We have not had a spoken language of our own for
 several thousand years.""


 He darted a glance at Syme's darkly scowling face. His own hairy face
 was expressionless, but Syme sensed that he was amused. ""Yes, you're
 right,"" he said. ""The language you and your fellows struggled to learn
 is a fraud, a hodge-podge concocted to deceive you.""


 Tate looked interested. ""But why this—this gigantic masquerade?""


 ""You had nothing to give us,"" the Martian said simply.


 Tate frowned, then flushed. ""You mean you avoided revealing yourselves
 because you—had nothing to gain from mental intercourse with us?""


 ""Yes.""


 Tate thought again. ""But—""


 ""No,"" the Martian interrupted him, ""revealing the extent of our
 civilization would have spared us nothing at your people's hands. Yours
 is an imperialist culture, and you would have had Mars, whether you
 thought you were taking it from equals or not.""


 ""Never mind that,"" Syme broke in impatiently. ""What do you want with
 us?""


 The Martian looked at him appraisingly. ""You already suspect.
 Unfortunately, you must die.""
It was a weird situation, Syme thought. His mind was racing, but as yet
 he could see no way out. He began to wonder, if he did, could he keep
 the Martians from knowing about it? Then he realized that the Martian
 must have received that thought, too, and he was enraged. He stood,
 holding himself in check with an effort.


 ""Will you tell us why?"" Tate asked.


 ""You were brought here for that purpose. It is part of our conception
 of justice. I will tell you and your—friend—anything you wish to
 know.""


 Syme noticed that the other Martians had retired to the farther side of
 the cavern. Some were munching the glowing fungus. That left only the
 leader, who was standing alertly on all fours a short distance away
 from them, holding the Benson gun trained on them. Syme tried not to
 think about the gun, especially about making a grab for it. It was like
 trying not to think of the word ""hippopotamus.""


 Tate squatted down comfortably on the floor of the cavern, apparently
 unconcerned, but his hands were trembling slightly. ""First why—"" he
 began.


 ""There are many secrets in Kal-Jmar,"" the Martian said, ""among them a
 very simple catalyzing agent which could within fifty years transform
 Mars to a planet with Terrestrially-thick atmosphere.""


 ""I think I see,"" Tate said thoughtfully. ""That's been the ultimate aim
 all along, but so far the problem has us licked. If we solved it, then
 we'd have all of Mars, not just the cities. Your people would die out.
 You couldn't have that, of course.""


 He sighed deeply. He spread his gloved hands before him and looked
 at them with a queer intentness. ""Well—how about the Martians—the
 Kal-Jmar Martians, I mean? I'd dearly love to know the answer to that
 one.""


 ""Neither of the alternatives in your mind is correct. They were not a
 separate species, although they were unlike us. But they were not our
 ancestors, either. They were the contemporaries of our ancestors.""


 ""Several thousand years ago Mars' loss of atmosphere began to make
 itself felt. There were two ways out. Some chose to seal themselves
 into cities like Kal-Jmar; our ancestors chose to adapt their bodies to
 the new conditions. Thus the race split. Their answer to the problem
 was an evasion; they remained static. Our answer was the true one, for
 we progressed. We progressed beyond the need of science; they remained
 its slaves. They died of a plague—and other causes.


 ""You see,"" he finished gently, ""our deception has caused a natural
 confusion in your minds. They were the degenerates, not we.""


 ""And yet,"" Tate mused, ""you are being destroyed by contact with
 an—inferior—culture.""


 ""We hope to win yet,"" the Martian said.


 Tate stood up, his face very white. ""Tell me one thing,"" he begged.
 ""Will our two races ever live together in amity?""


 The Martian lowered his head. ""That is for unborn generations."" He
 looked at Tate again and aimed the energy gun. ""You are a brave man,""
 he said. ""I am sorry.""


 Syme saw all his hopes of treasure and glory go glimmering down the
 sights of the Martian's Benson gun, and suddenly the pent-up rage in
 him exploded. Too swiftly for his intention to be telegraphed, before
 he knew himself what he meant to do, he hurled himself bodily into the
 Martian.
It was like tangling with a draft horse. The Martian was astonishingly
 strong. Syme scrambled desperately for the gun, got it, but couldn't
 tear it out of the Martian's fingers. And all the time he could almost
 feel the Martian's telepathic call for help surging out. He heard the
 swift pad of his followers coming across the cavern.


 He put everything he had into one mighty, murderous effort. Every
 muscle fiber in his superbly trained body crackled and surged with
 power. He roared his fury. And the gun twisted out of the Martian's
 iron grip!


 He clubbed the prostrate leader with it instantly, then reversed the
 weapon and snapped a shot at the nearest Martian. The creature dropped
 his lance and fell without a sound.


 The next instant a ray blinked at him, and he rolled out of the way
 barely in time. The searing ray cut a swath over the leader's body and
 swerved to cut down on him. Still rolling, he fired at the holder of
 the weapon. The gun dropped and winked out on the floor.


 Syme jumped to his feet and faced his enemies, snarling like the
 trapped tiger he was. Another ray slashed at him, and he bent lithely
 to let it whistle over his head. Another, lower this time. He flipped
 his body into the air and landed upright, his gun still blazing. His
 right leg burned fiercely from a ray-graze, but he ignored it. And
 all the while he was mowing down the massed natives in great swaths,
 seeking out the ones armed with Bensons in swift, terrible slashes,
 dodging spears and other missiles in midair, and roaring at the top of
 his powerful lungs.


 At last there were none with guns left to oppose him. He scythed down
 the rest in two terrible, lightning sweeps of his ray, then dropped
 the weapon from blistered fingers.


 He was gasping for breath, and realized that he was losing air from
 the seared-open right leg of his suit. He reached for the emergency
 kit at his side, drawing in great, gasping breaths, and fumbled out
 a tube of sealing liquid. He spread the stuff on liberally, smearing
 it impartially over flesh and fabric. It felt like liquid hell on the
 burned, bleeding leg, but he kept on until the quick-drying fluid
 formed an airtight patch.


 Only then did he turn, to see Tate flattened against the wall behind
 him, his hands empty at his sides. ""I'm sorry,"" Tate said miserably. ""I
 could have grabbed a spear or something, but—I just couldn't, not even
 to save my own life. I—I halfway hoped they'd kill both of us.""


 Syme glared at him and spat, too enraged to think of diplomacy. He
 turned and strode out of the cavern, carrying his right leg stiffly,
 but with his feral, tigerish head held high.


 He led the way, wordlessly, back to the wrecked sand car. Tate followed
 him with a hangdog, beaten air, as though he had just found something
 that shattered all his previous concepts of the verities in life, and
 didn't know what to do about it.


 Still silently, Syme refilled his oxygen tank, watched Tate do the
 same, and then picked up two spare tanks and the precious black
 suitcase and handed one of the tanks to Tate. Then he stumped around
 to the back of the car and inspected the damage. The cable reel, which
 might have drawn them out of the gully, was hopelessly smashed. That
 was that.

If it was happening to him, all right, he could
 
take that ... but what if he was happening to it?
Putting people painlessly to sleep is really a depressing job. It
 keeps me awake at night thinking of all those bodies I have sent to
 the vaults, and it interferes to a marked extent with my digestion. I
 thought before Councilman Coleman came to see me that there wasn't much
 that could bother me worse.


 Coleman came in the morning before I was really ready to face the
 day. My nerves were fairly well shot from the kind of work I did as
 superintendent of Dreamland. I chewed up my pill to calm me down,
 the one to pep me up, the capsule to strengthen my qualities as a
 relentless perfectionist. I washed them down with gin and orange
 juice and sat back, building up my fortitude to do business over the
 polished deck of my desk.


 But instead of the usual morning run of hysterical relatives and
 masochistic mystics, I had to face one of my superiors from the
 Committee itself.


 Councilman Coleman was an impressive figure in a tailored black tunic.
 His olive features were set off by bristling black eyes and a mobile
 mustache. He probably scared most people, but not me. Authority doesn't
 frighten me any more. I've put to sleep too many megalomaniacs,
 dictators, and civil servants.


 ""Warden Walker, I've been following your career with considerable
 interest,"" Coleman said.


 ""My career hasn't been very long, sir,"" I said modestly. I didn't
 mention that
nobody
could last that long in my job. At least, none
 had yet.


 ""I've followed it from the first. I know every step you've made.""


 I didn't know whether to be flattered or apprehensive. ""That's fine,"" I
 said. It didn't sound right.


 ""Tell me,"" Coleman said, crossing his legs, ""what do you think of
 Dreamland in principle?""


 ""Why, it's the logical step forward in penal servitude. Man has been
 heading toward this since he first started civilizing himself. After
 all, some criminals
can't
be helped psychiatrically. We can't execute
 them or turn them free; we have to imprison them.""


 I waited for Coleman's reaction. He merely nodded.


 ""Of course, it's barbaric to think of a prison as a place of
 punishment,"" I continued. ""A prison is a place to keep a criminal away
 from society for a specific time so he can't harm that society for that
 time. Punishment, rehabilitation, all of it is secondary to that. The
 purpose of confinement is confinement.""
The councilman edged forward an inch. ""And you really think Dreamland
 is the most humane confinement possible?""


 ""Well,"" I hedged, ""it's the most humane we've found yet. I suppose
 living through a—uh—movie with full sensory participation for year
 after year can get boring.""


 ""I should think so,"" Coleman said emphatically. ""Warden, don't you
 sometimes feel the old system where the prisoners had the diversions
 of riots, solitary confinement, television, and jailbreaks may have
 made time easier to serve? Do these men ever think they are
actually
living these vicarious adventures?""


 That was a question that made all of us in the Dreamland service
 uneasy. ""No, Councilman, they don't. They know they aren't really
 Alexander of Macedonia, Tarzan, Casanova, or Buffalo Bill. They are
 conscious of all the time that is being spent out of their real lives;
 they know they have relatives and friends outside the dream. They know,
 unless—""


 Coleman lifted a dark eyebrow above a black iris. ""Unless?""


 I cleared my throat. ""Unless they go mad and really believe the dream
 they are living. But as you know, sir, the rate of madness among
 Dreamland inmates is only slightly above the norm for the population as
 a whole.""


 ""How do prisoners like that adjust to reality?""


 Was he deliberately trying to ask tough questions? ""They don't. They
 think they are having some kind of delusion. Many of them become
 schizoid and pretend to go along with reality while secretly 'knowing'
 it to be a lie.""


 Coleman removed a pocket secretary and broke it open. ""About these new
 free-choice models—do you think they genuinely are an improvement over
 the old fixed-image machines?""


 ""Yes, sir,"" I replied. ""By letting the prisoner project his own
 imagination onto the sense tapes and giving him a limited amount of
 alternatives to a situation, we can observe whether he is conforming to
 society to a larger extent.""


 ""I'm glad you said that, Walker,"" Councilman Coleman told me warmly.
 ""As I said, I've been following your career closely, and if you
 get through the next twenty-four-hour period as you have through
 the foregoing part of your Dream, you will be awakened at this time
 tomorrow. Congratulations!""


 I sat there and took it.


 He was telling
me
, the superintendent of Dreamland, that my own
 life here was only a Dream such as I fed to my own prisoners. It was
 unbelievably absurd, a queasy little joke of some kind. But I didn't
 deny it.
If it
were
true, if I had forgotten that everything that happened was
 only a Dream, and if I admitted it, the councilman would know I was
 mad.
It couldn't be true.
Yet—


 Hadn't I thought about it ever since I had been appointed warden and
 transferred from my personnel job at the plant?


 Whenever I had come upon two people talking, and it seemed as if I had
 come upon those same two people talking the same talk before, hadn't I
 wondered for an instant if it couldn't be a Dream, not reality at all?


 Once I had experienced a Dream for five or ten minutes. I was driving
 a ground car down a spidery road made into a dismal tunnel by weeping
 trees, a dank, lavender maze. I had known at the time it was a Dream,
 but still, as the moments passed, I became more intent on the
 difficult road before me, my blocky hands on the steering wheel, thick
 fingers typing out the pattern of motion on the drive buttons.


 I could remember that. Maybe I couldn't remember being shoved into the
 prison vault for so many years for such and such a crime.


 I didn't really believe this, not then, but I couldn't afford to make
 a mistake, even if it were only some sort of intemperate test—as I
 was confident it was, with a sweet, throbbing fury against the man who
 would employ such a jagged broadsword for prying in his bureaucratic
 majesty.


 ""I've always thought,"" I said, ""that it would be a good idea to show
 a prisoner what the modern penal system was all about by giving him a
 Dream in which he dreamed about Dreamland itself.""


 ""Yes, indeed,"" Coleman concurred. Just that and no more.


 I leaned intimately across my beautiful oak desk. ""I've thought that
 projecting officials into the Dream and letting them talk with the
 prisoners might be a more effective form of investigation than mere
 observation.""


 ""I should say so,"" Coleman remarked, and got up.


 I
had
to get more out of him, some proof, some clue beyond the
 preposterous announcement he had made.


 ""I'll see you tomorrow at this time then, Walker."" The councilman
 nodded curtly and turned to leave my office.


 I held onto the sides of my desk to keep from diving over and teaching
 him to change his concept of humor.


 The day was starting. If I got through it, giving a good show, I would
 be released from my Dream, he had said smugly.


 But if this was a dream, did I want probation to reality?
Horbit was a twitchy little man whose business tunic was the same
 rodent color as his hair. He had a pronounced tic in his left cheek. ""I
 have to get back,"" he told me with compelling earnestness.


 ""Mr. Horbit—Eddie—"" I said, glancing at his file projected on my desk
 pad, ""I can't put you back into a Dream. You served your full time for
 your crime. The maximum.""


 ""But I haven't adjusted to society!""


 ""Eddie, I can shorten sentences, but I can't expand them beyond the
 limit set by the courts.""


 A tear of frustration spilled out of his left eye with the next twitch.
 ""But Warden, sir, my psychiatrist said that I was unable to cope with
 reality. Come on now, Warden, you don't want a guy who can't cope with
 reality running around loose."" He paused, puzzled. ""Hell, I don't
 know why I can't express myself like I used to.""


 He could express himself much better in his Dream. He had been Abraham
 Lincoln in his Dream, I saw. He had lived the life right up to the
 night when he was taking in
An American Cousin
at the Ford Theater.
 Horbit couldn't accept history that he had no more life to live. He
 only knew that if in his delirium he could gain Dreamland once more, he
 could get back to the hard realities of dealing with the problems of
 Reconstruction.


 ""
Please
,"" he begged.


 I looked up from the file. ""I'm sorry, Eddie.""


 His eyes narrowed, both of them, on the next twitch. ""Warden, I can
 always go out and commit another anti-social act.""


 ""I'm afraid not, Eddie. The file shows you are capable of only one
 crime. And you don't have a wife any more, and she doesn't have a
 lover.""


 Horbit laughed. ""Your files aren't infallible, Warden.""


 With one gesture, he ripped open his tunic and tore into his own flesh.
 No, not his own flesh. Pseudo-flesh. He took out the gun that was
 underneath.


 ""The beamer is made of X-ray-transparent plastic, Warden, but it works
 as well as one made of steel and lead.""


 ""Now that you've got it in here,"" I said in time with the pulse in my
 throat, ""what are you going to do with it?""


 ""I'm going to make you go down to the vaults and put me back to sleep,
 Warden.""


 I nodded. ""I suppose you can do that. But what's to prevent me from
 waking you up as soon as I've taken away your gun?""


 ""This!"" He tossed a sheet of paper onto my desk.


 ""What's this?"" I asked unnecessarily. I could read it.


 ""A confession that you accepted a bribe to put me back to sleep,""
 Horbit said, his tic beating out a feverish tempo. ""As soon as you've
 signed it, I'll use your phone to have it telefaxed to the Registrar of
 Private Documents.""


 I had to admire the thought behind the idea. Horbit was convinced that
 I was only a figment of his unfocused imagination, but he was playing
 the game with uncompromising logic, trusting that even madness had hard
 and tight rules behind it.


 There was also something else I admired about the plan.


 It could work.


 Once he fed that document to the archives, I would be obligated to help
 him even without the gun. My word would probably be taken that I had
 been forced to do it at gunpoint, but there would always be doubts,
 enough to wreck my career when it came time for promotion.


 Nothing like this had ever happened in my years as warden.
Suddenly, Coleman's words hit me in the back of the neck.
If I got
 through the next twenty-four hours.
This had to be some kind of test.


 But a test for what?


 Had I been deliberately told that I was living only a Dream to see
 if my ethics would hold up even when I thought I wasn't dealing with
 reality?


 Or if this
was
only a Dream, was it a test to see if I was morally
 ready to return to the real, the earnest world?


 But if it was a test to see if I was ready for reality, did I want to
 pass it? My life was nerve-racking and mind-wrecking, but I liked the
 challenge—it was the only life I knew or could believe in.


 What was I going to do?


 The only thing I knew was that I couldn't tune in tomorrow and find out.


 The time was
now
.


 Horbit motioned the gun to my desk set. ""Sign that paper.""


 I reached out and took hold of his wrist. I squeezed.


 Horbit's screams brought in the guards.


 I picked up the gun from where he had dropped it and handed it to
 Captain Keller, my head guard, a tough old bird who wore his uniform
 like armor.


 ""Trying to force his way back to the sleep tanks,"" I told Keller.


 He nodded. ""Happened before. Back when old man Preston lost his grip.""


 Preston had been my predecessor. He had lost his hold on reality like
 all the others before him who had served long as warden of Dreamland.
 A few had quit while they were still ahead and spent the rest of their
 lives recuperating. Our society didn't produce individuals tough enough
 to stand the strain of putting their fellow human beings to sleep for
 long.


 One of Keller's men had stabbed Horbit's arm with a hypospray to
 blanket the pain from his broken wrist, and the man was quieter.


 ""I couldn't have done it, Warden,"" Horbit mumbled drowsily. ""I couldn't
 kill anybody. Unless it was like that other time.""


 ""Of course, Eddie,"" I said.


 I had banked on that, hadn't I, when I made my move?


 Or did I?


 Wasn't it perhaps a matter of knowing that all of it wasn't real and
 that the safety cutoffs in even a free-choice model of a Dream Machine
 couldn't let me come to any real harm? I had been suspiciously brave,
 disarming a dedicated maniac. With only an hour to spare for gym a day,
 I could barely press 350 pounds. I was hardly in shape for personal
 combat.


 On the other hand, maybe I actually wanted something to go wrong so my
 sleep sentence would be extended. Or was it that, in some sane part of
 my mind, I wanted release from unreality badly enough to take any risk
 to prove that I was morally capable of returning to the real world?


 It was a carrousel and I couldn't catch the brass ring no matter how
 many turns I went spinning through.


 I hardly heard Horbit when he half-shouted at me as my men led him from
 the room. Glancing up sharply, I saw him straining purposefully against
 the bonds of muscle and narcotic that held him.
""You have to send me back now, Warden,"" he was shrilling. ""You have to!
 I tried to coerce you with a gun. That's a crime, Warden—you
know
that's a crime! I have to be put to sleep!""


 Keller flicked his mustache with a thick thumbnail. ""How about that?
 You won't let a guy back into the sleepy-bye pads, so he pulls a gun
 on you to make you, and
that
makes him eligible. He couldn't lose,
 Warden. No, sir, he had it made.""


 My answer to Keller was forming, building up in my jaw muscles, but I
 took a pill and it went away.


 ""Hold him in the detention quarters,"" I said finally. ""I'm going to
 make a study of this.""


 Keller winked knowingly and sauntered out of the office, his left hand
 swinging the blackjack the Committee had taken away from him a decade
 before.


 The problem of what to do with Keller wasn't particularly atypical of
 the ones I had to solve daily and I wasn't going to let that worry me.
 Much.


 I pressed my button to let Mrs. Engle know I was ready for the next
 interview.
They came. There were the hysterical relatives, the wives and mothers
 and brothers who demanded that their kin be Awakened because they were
 special cases, not really guilty, or needed at home, or possessed of
 such awesome talents and qualities as to be exempt from the laws of
 lesser men.


 Once in a while I granted a parole for a prisoner to see a dying mother
 or if some important project was falling apart without his help, but
 most of the time I just sat with my eyes propped open, letting a sea of
 vindictive screeching and beseeching wailings wash around me.


 The relatives and legal talent were spaced with hungry-eyed mystics
 who were convinced they could contemplate God and their navels
 both conscientiously as an incarnation of Gautama. To risk sounding
 religiously intolerant, I usually kicked these out pretty swiftly.


 The onetime inmate who wanted back in after a reprieve was fairly rare.
 Few of them ever got
that
crazy.


 But it was my luck to get another the same day,
the
day for me, as
 Horbit.


 Paulson was a tall, lean man with sad eyes. The clock above his sharp
 shoulder bone said five till noon. I didn't expect him to take much out
 of my lunch hour.


 ""Warden,"" Paulson said, ""I've decided to give myself up. I murdered a
 blind beggar the other night.""


 ""For his pencils?"" I asked.


 Paulson shifted uneasily. ""No, sir. For his money. I needed some extra
 cash and I was stronger than he was, so why shouldn't I take it?""


 I examined the projection of his file. He was an embezzler, not a
 violent man. He had served his time and been released. Conceivably he
 might embezzle again, but the Committee saw to it that temptation was
 never again placed in his path. He would not commit a crime of violence.


 ""Look, Paulson,"" I said, a trifle testily, ""if you have so little
 conscience as to kill a blind old man for a few dollars, where do you
 suddenly get enough guilt feelings to cause you to give yourself up?""


 Paulson tried his insufficient best to smile evilly. ""It wasn't
 conscience, Warden. I never lie awake a minute whenever I kill
 anybody. It's just—well, Dreaming isn't so bad. Last time I was Allen
 Pinkerton, the detective. It was exciting. A lot more exciting than the
 kind of life I lead.""


 I nodded solemnly. ""Yes, no doubt strangling old men in the streets can
 be pretty dull for a red-blooded man of action.""


 ""Yes,"" Paulson said earnestly, ""it does get to be a humdrum routine.
 I've been experimenting with all sorts of murders, but I just don't
 seem to get much of a kick out of them now. I'd like to try it from the
 other end as Pinkerton again. Of course, if you can't arrange it, I
 guess I'll have to go out and see what I can do with, say, an ax."" His
 eye glittered almost convincingly.


 ""Paulson, you know I could have you watched night and day if I thought
 you really were a murderer. But I can't send you back to the sleep
 vaults without proof and conviction for a crime.""


 ""That doesn't sound very reasonable,"" Paulson objected. ""Turning loose
 a homicidal maniac who is offering to go back to the vaults of his own
 free will just because you lack a little trifling proof of his guilt.""


 ""Sure,"" I told him, ""but I don't want to share the same noose with you.
 My job is to keep the innocent out and the convicted in. And I do my
 job, Paulson.""


 ""But you have to! If you don't, I'll have to go out and establish my
 guilt with another crime. Do you want a crime on your hands, Warden?""


 I studied his record. There was a chance, just a chance....


 ""Do you want to wait voluntarily in the detention quarters?"" I asked
 him.


 He agreed readily enough.


 I watched him out of the office and rang for lunch.


 The news on the wall video was dull as usual. A man got tired of
 hearing peace, safety, prosperity and brotherly love all the time. I
 dug into my strained spinach, raw hamburger, and chewed up my white
 pill, my red pill, my ebony pill, and my second white pill. The gin and
 tomato juice took the taste away.


 I was ready for the afternoon session.
Matrons were finishing the messy job of dragging a hysterical woman
 out of the office when Keller came back. He had a stubborn look on his
 flattened, red face.


 ""New prisoner asking to see you personal,"" Keller reported. ""Told him
 no. Okay?""


 ""No,"" I said. ""He can see me. That's the law and you know it. He
 isn't violent, is he?"" I asked in some concern. The room was still in
 disarray.


 ""Naw, he ain't violent, Warden. He just thinks he's somebody important.""


 ""Sounds like a case for therapy, not Dreamland. Who does he think he
 is?""


 ""One of the Committee—Councilman Coleman.""


 ""Mm-hmm. And who is he really, Captain?""


 ""Councilman Coleman.""


 I whistled. ""What did they nail him on?""


 ""Misuse of authority.""


 ""And he didn't get a suspended for that?""


 ""Wasn't his first offense. Still want to see him?""


 I gave a lateral wave of my hand. ""Of course.""


 My pattern of living—call it my office routine—had been
 re-established through the day. I hadn't had a chance to brood much
 over the bombshell Coleman had tossed in my lap in the morning, but now
 I could think.


 Coleman entered wearing the same black tunic, the same superior
 attitude. His black eyes fastened on me.


 ""Sit down, Councilman,"" I directed.


 He deigned to comply.


 I studied the files flashed before me. Several times before, Coleman
 had been guilty of slight misuses of his authority: helping his
 friends, harming his enemies. Not enough to make him be impeached
 from the Committee. His job was so hypersensitive that if every
 transgression earned dismissal, no one could hold the position more
 than a day. Even with the best intentions, mistakes can be taken for
 deliberate errors. Not to mention the converse. For his earlier errors,
 Coleman had first received a suspended sentence, then two terminal
 sentences to be fixed by the warden. My predecessors had given him
 first a few weeks, then a few months of sleep in Dreamland.
Coleman's eyes didn't frighten me; I focused right on the pupils. ""That
 was a pretty foul trick, Councilman. Did you hope to somehow frighten
 me out of executing this sentence by what you told me this morning?""


 I couldn't follow his reasoning. Just how making me think my life was
 only a Dream such as I imposed on my own prisoners could help him, I
 couldn't see.


 ""Warden Walker,"" Coleman intoned in his magnificent voice, ""I'm
 shocked.
I
am not personally monitoring your Dream. The Committee as
 a whole will decide whether you are capable of returning to the real
 world. Moreover, please don't get carried away. I'm not concerned with
 what you do to this sensory projection of myself, beyond how it helps
 to establish your moral capabilities.""


 ""I suppose,"" I said heavily, ""that I could best establish my high moral
 character by excusing you from this penal sentence?""


 ""Not at all,"" Councilman Coleman asserted. ""According to the facts as
 you know them, I am 'guilty' and must be confined.""


 I was stymied for an instant. I had expected him to say that I must
 know that he was incapable of committing such an error and I must
 pardon him despite the misguided rulings of the courts. Then I thought
 of something else.


 ""You show symptoms of being a habitual criminal, Coleman. I think you
 deserve
life
.""


 Coleman cocked his head thoughtfully, concerned. ""That seems rather
 extreme, Warden.""


 ""You would suggest a shorter sentence?""


 ""If it were my place to choose, yes. A few years, perhaps. But
 life—no, I think not.""


 I threw up my hands. You don't often see somebody do that, but I did.
 I couldn't figure him. Coleman had wealth and power as a councilman
 in the real world, but I had thought somehow he wanted to escape to a
 Dream world. Yet he didn't want to be in for life, the way Paulson and
 Horbit did.


 There seemed to be no point or profit in what he had told me that
 morning, nothing in it for him.


 Unless—


 Unless what he said was literally true.


 I stood up. My knees wanted to quit halfway up, but I made it. ""This,""
 I said, ""is a difficult decision for me, sir. Would you make yourself
 comfortable here for a time, Councilman?""


 Coleman smiled benignly. ""Certainly, Warden.""


 I walked out of my office, slowly and carefully.
Horbit was sitting in his detention quarters idly flicking through
 a book tape on the Civil War when I found him. The tic in his cheek
 marked time with every new page.


 ""President Lincoln,"" I said reverently.


 Horbit looked up, his eyes set in a clever new way. ""
You
call me
 that. Does it mean I am recovering? You don't mean now that I'm getting
 back my right senses?""


 ""Mr. President, the situation you find yourself in now is something
 stranger and more evil than any madness. I am not a phantom of your
 mind—I am a
real
man. This wild, distorted place is a
real
place.""


 ""Do you think you can pull the wool over my eyes, you scamp? Mine eyes
 have seen the glory.""


 ""Yes, sir."" I sat down beside him and looked earnestly into his
 twitching face. ""But I know you have always believed in the occult.""


 He nodded slowly. ""I
have
often suspected this was hell.""


 ""Not quite, sir. The occult has its own rigid laws. It is perfectly
 scientific. This world is in another dimension—one that is not length,
 breadth or thickness—but a real one nevertheless.""


 ""An interesting theory. Go ahead.""


 ""This world is more scientifically advanced than the one you come
 from—and this advanced science has fallen into the hands of a
 well-meaning despot.""


 Horbit nodded again. ""The Jefferson Davis type.""


 He didn't understand Lincoln's beliefs very well, but I pretended to
 go along with him. ""Yes, sir. He—our leader—doubts your abilities as
 President. He is not above meddling in the affairs of an alien world
 if he believes he is doing good. He has convicted you to this world in
 that belief.""


 He chuckled. ""Many of my countrymen share his convictions.""


 ""Maybe,"" I said. ""But many here do not. I don't. I know you must return
 to guide the Reconstruction. But first you must convince our leader of
 your worth.""


 ""How am I going to accomplish that?"" Horbit asked worriedly.


 ""You are going to have a companion from now on, an agent of the leader,
 who will pretend to be something he isn't. You must pretend to believe
 in what he claims to be, and convince him of your high intelligence,
 moral responsibilities, and qualities of leadership.""


 ""Yes,"" Horbit said thoughtfully, ""yes. I must try to curb my tendency
 for telling off-color jokes. My wife is always nagging me about that.""
Paulson was only a few doors away from Horbit. I found him with his
 long, thin legs stretched out in front of him, staring dismally into
 the gloom of the room. No wonder he found reality so boring and
 depressing with so downbeat a mood cycle. I wondered why they hadn't
 been able to do something about adjusting his metabolism.


 ""Paulson,"" I said gently, ""I want to speak with you.""


 He bolted upright in his chair. ""You're going to put me back to sleep.""


 ""I came to talk to you about that,"" I admitted.


 I pulled up a seat and adjusted the lighting so only his face and mine
 seemed to float bodiless in a sea of night, two moons of flesh.


 ""Paulson—or should I call you Pinkerton?—this will come as a shock, a
 shock I know only a fine analytical mind like yours could stand. You
 think your life as the great detective was only a Dream induced by some
 miraculous machine. But, sir, believe me: that life was
real
.""


 Paulson's eyes rolled slightly back into his head and changed their
 luster. ""Then
this
is the Dream. I've thought—""


 ""No!"" I snapped. ""This world is also real.""


 I went through the same Fourth Dimension waltz as I had auditioned for
 Horbit. At the end of it, Paulson was nodding just as eagerly.


 ""I could be destroyed for telling you this, but our leader is planning
 the most gigantic conquest known to any intelligent race in the
 Universe. He is going to conquer Earth in all its possible futures and
 all its possible pasts. After that, there are other planets.""


 ""He must be stopped!"" Paulson shouted.


 I laid my palm on his arm. ""Armies can't stop him, nor can fantastic
 secret weapons. Only one thing can stop him: the greatest detective who
 ever lived. Pinkerton!""


 ""Yes,"" Paulson said. ""I suppose I could.""


 ""He knows that. But he's a fiend. He wants a battle of wits with you,
 his only possible foe, for the satisfaction of making a fool of you.""


 ""Easier said than done, my friend,"" Paulson said crisply.


 ""True,"" I agreed, ""but he is devious, the devil! He plans to convince
 you that he also has been removed to this world from his own, even as
 you have. He will claim to be Abraham Lincoln.""


 ""No!""


 ""Yes, and he will pretend to find you accidentally and get you to help
 him find a way back to his own world, glorying in making a fool of you.
 But you can use every moment to learn his every weakness.""


 ""But wait. I know President Lincoln well. I guarded him on his first
 inauguration trip. How could this leader of yours fool me? Does he look
 like the President?""


 ""Not at all. But remember, the dimensional shift changes physical
 appearance. You've noticed that in yourself.""


 ""Yes, of course,"" Paulson muttered. ""But he couldn't hoax me. My keen
 powers of deduction would have seen through him in an instant!""
I saw Horbit and Paulson happily off in each other's company. Paulson
 was no longer bored by a reality in which he was matching wits with
 the first master criminal of the paratime universe, and Horbit was no
 longer hopeless in his quest to gain another reality because he knew
 he was not merely insane now.


 It was a pair of fantastic stories that no man in his right mind would
 believe—but that didn't make them invalid to a brace of ex-Sleepers.
 They
wanted
to believe them. The stories gave them what they were
 after—without me having to break the law and put them to sleep for
 crimes they hadn't committed.


 They would find out some day that I had lied to them, but maybe by that
 time they would have realized this world wasn't so bad.


 Fortunately, I was confident from their psych records that they were
 both incapable of ending their little game by homicide, no matter how
 justified they might think it was.


 ""Hey, Warden,"" Captain Keller bellowed as I approached my office
 door, ""when are you going to let me throw that stiff Coleman into the
 sleepy-bye vaults? He's still sitting in there on your furniture as
 smug as you please.""


 ""You don't sound as if you like our distinguished visitor very well,"" I
 remarked.


 ""It's not that. I just don't think he deserves any special privileges.
 Besides, it was guys like him that took away our nightsticks. My boys
 didn't like that. Look at me—I'm defenseless!""


 I looked at his square figure. ""Not quite, Captain, not quite.""


 Now was the time.


 I stretched out my wet palm toward the door.


 Was or was not Coleman telling the truth when he said this life of mine
 was itself only a Dream? If it was, did I want to finish my last day
 with the right decision so I could return to some alien reality? Or did
 I deliberately want to make a mistake so I could continue living the
 opiate of my Dream?


 Then, as I touched the door, I knew the only decision that could have
 any meaning for me.


 Councilman Coleman didn't look as if he had moved since I had left him.
 He was unwrinkled, unperspiring, his eyes and mustache crisp as ever.
 He smiled at me briefly in supreme confidence.


 I changed my decision then, in that moment. And, in the next, changed
 it back to my original choice.


 ""Coleman,"" I said, ""you can get out of here. As warden, I'm granting
 you a five-year probation.""


 The councilman stood up swiftly, his eyes catching little sparks
 of yellow light. ""I don't approve of your decision, Warden. Not at
 all. Unless you alter it, I'll be forced to convince the rest of the
 Committee that your decisions are becoming faulty, that you are losing
 your grip just as all your predecessors did.""


 My muscles relaxed in a spasm and it took the fresh flow of adrenalin
 to get me to the chair behind my desk. I took a pill. I took two pills.


 ""Tell me, Councilman, what happened to the offer to release me from
 this phony Dream? Now you are talking as if
this
world was the
real
one.""


 Coleman parted his lips, but then the planes of his face shifted into
 another pattern. ""You never believed me.""


 ""Almost, but not quite. You knew I was on the narrow edge in this kind
 of job, but I'm not as far out as you seemed to have thought.""


 ""I can still wreck your career, you know.""


 ""I don't think so. That would constitute a misuse of authority, and
 the next time you turn up before me, I'm going to give you
life
in
 Dreamland.""


 Coleman sat back down suddenly.


 ""You don't want life as a Sleeper, do you?"" I pursued. ""You did want
 a relatively
short
sentence of a few months or a few years. I can
 think of two reasons why. The answer is probably a combination of
 both. In the first place, you are a joy-popper with Dreams—you don't
 want to live out your life in one, but you like a brief Dream every
 few years like an occasional dose of a narcotic. In the second place,
 you probably have political reasons for wanting to hide out somewhere
 in safety for the next few years. The world isn't as placid as the
 newscasts sometimes make it seem.""
He didn't say anything. I didn't think he had to.


 ""You wanted to make sure I made a painfully scrupulous decision in
 your case,"" I went on. ""You didn't want me to pardon you completely
 because of your high position, but at the same time you didn't want too
 long a sentence. But I'm doing you no favors. You get no time from me,
 Coleman.""


 ""How did you decide to do this?"" he asked. ""Don't tell me you never
 doubted. We've all doubted since we found out about the machines: which
 was real and which was the Dream? How did you decide to risk this?""


 ""I acted the only way I could act,"" I said. ""I decided I had to act as
 if my life was real and that you were lying. I decided that because, if
 all this were false, if I could have no more confidence in my own mind
 and my own senses than that, I didn't give a damn if it
were
all a
 Dream.""


 Coleman stood up and walked out of my office.


 The clock told me it was after five. I began clearing my desk.


 Captain Keller stuck his head in, unannounced. ""Hey, Warden, there's an
 active one out here. He claims that Dreamland compromises His plan for
 the Free Will of the Universe.""


 ""Well, escort him inside, Captain,"" I said.


 I put away my pills. Solving simple problems such as the new visitor
 presented always helped me to relax.

Illustrated by Kramer
Being an interstellar trouble shooter wouldn’t be so bad …
 if I could shoot the trouble!


 The
 Old Man had that look of intense glee on his face that meant someone
 was in for a very rough time. Since we were alone, it took no great feat
 of intelligence to figure it would be me. I talked first, bold attack
 being the best defense and so forth.


 “I quit. Don’t bother telling me what dirty job you have
 cooked up, because I have already quit and you do not want to reveal
 company secrets to me.”


 The grin was even wider now and he actually chortled as he thumbed a
 button on his console. A thick legal document slid out of the delivery
 slot onto his desk.


 “This is your contract,” he said. “It tells how and
 when you will work. A steel-and-vanadium-bound contract that you
 couldn’t crack with a molecular disruptor.”


 I leaned out quickly, grabbed it and threw it into the air with a single
 motion. Before it could fall, I had my Solar out and, with a wide-angle
 shot, burned the contract to ashes.


 The Old Man pressed the button again and another contract slid out on
 his desk. If possible, the smile was still wider now.


 “I should have said a
 duplicate
 of your contract—like this
 one here.” He made a quick note on his secretary plate. “I
 have deducted 13 credits from your salary for the cost of the
 duplicate—as well as a 100-credit fine for firing a Solar inside a
 building.”


 I slumped, defeated, waiting for the blow to land. The Old Man fondled
 my contract.


 “According to this document, you can’t quit. Ever. Therefore
 I have a little job I know you’ll enjoy. Repair job. The Centauri
 beacon has shut down. It’s a Mark III beacon.…”


 “
 What
 kind of beacon?” I asked him. I have repaired
 hyperspace beacons from one arm of the Galaxy to the other and was sure
 I had worked on every type or model made. But I had never heard of this
 kind.


 “Mark III,” the Old Man repeated, practically chortling.
 “I never heard of it either until Records dug up the specs. They
 found them buried in the back of their oldest warehouse. This was the
 earliest type of beacon ever built—by Earth, no less. Considering
 its location on one of the Proxima Centauri planets, it might very well
 be the first beacon.”
I looked
 at the blueprints he handed me and felt my eyes glaze with
 horror. “It’s a monstrosity! It looks more like a distillery
 than a beacon—must be at least a few hundred meters high.
 I’m a repairman, not an archeologist. This pile of junk is over
 2000 years old. Just forget about it and build a new one.”


 The Old Man leaned over his desk, breathing into my face. “It
 would take a year to install a new beacon—besides being too
 expensive—and this relic is on one of the main routes. We have
 ships making fifteen-light-year detours now.”


 He leaned back, wiped his hands on his handkerchief and gave me Lecture
 Forty-four on Company Duty and My Troubles.


 “This department is officially called Maintenance and Repair, when
 it really should be called trouble-shooting. Hyperspace beacons are made
 to last forever—or damn close to it. When one of them breaks down,
 it is
 never
 an accident, and repairing the thing is never a matter of
 just plugging in a new part.”


 He was telling
 me
 —the guy who did the job while he sat back on his
 fat paycheck in an air-conditioned office.


 He rambled on. “How I wish that were all it took! I would have a
 fleet of parts ships and junior mechanics to install them. But its not
 like that at all. I have a fleet of expensive ships that are equipped to
 do almost anything—manned by a bunch of irresponsibles like
 you
 .”


 I nodded moodily at his pointing finger.


 “How I wish I could fire you all! Combination space-jockeys,
 mechanics, engineers, soldiers, con-men and anything else it takes to do
 the repairs. I have to browbeat, bribe, blackmail and bulldoze you thugs
 into doing a simple job. If you think you’re fed up, just think
 how I feel. But the ships must go through! The beacons must
 operate!”


 I recognized this deathless line as the curtain speech and crawled to my
 feet. He threw the Mark III file at me and went back to scratching in
 his papers. Just as I reached the door, he looked up and impaled me on
 his finger again.


 “And don’t get any fancy ideas about jumping your contract.
 We can attach that bank account of yours on Algol II long before you
 could draw the money out.”


 I smiled, a little weakly, I’m afraid, as if I had never meant to
 keep that account a secret. His spies were getting more efficient every
 day. Walking down the hall, I tried to figure a way to transfer the
 money without his catching on—and knew at the same time he was
 figuring a way to outfigure me.


 It was all very depressing, so I stopped for a drink, then went on to
 the spaceport.
By
 the time the ship was serviced, I had a course charted. The nearest
 beacon to the broken-down Proxima Centauri Beacon was on one of the
 planets of Beta Circinus and I headed there first, a short trip of only
 about nine days in hyperspace.


 To understand the importance of the beacons, you have to understand
 hyperspace. Not that many people do, but it is easy enough to understand
 that in this
 non
 -space the regular rules don’t apply. Speed and
 measurements are a matter of relationship, not constant facts like the
 fixed universe.


 The first ships to enter hyperspace had no place to go—and no way
 to even tell if they had moved. The beacons solved that problem and
 opened the entire universe. They are built on planets and generate
 tremendous amounts of power. This power is turned into radiation that is
 punched through into hyperspace. Every beacon has a code signal as part
 of its radiation and represents a measurable point in hyperspace.
 Triangulation and quadrature of the beacons works for
 navigation—only it follows its own rules. The rules are complex
 and variable, but they are still rules that a navigator can follow.


 For a hyperspace jump, you need at least four beacons for an accurate
 fix. For long jumps, navigators use as many as seven or eight. So every
 beacon is important and every one has to keep operating. That is where I
 and the other trouble-shooters came in.


 We travel in well-stocked ships that carry a little bit of everything;
 only one man to a ship because that is all it takes to operate the
 overly efficient repair machinery. Due to the very nature of our job, we
 spend most of our time just rocketing through normal space. After all,
 when a beacon breaks down, how do you find it?


 Not through hyperspace. All you can do is approach as close as you can
 by using other beacons, then finish the trip in normal space. This can
 take months, and often does.


 This job didn’t turn out to be quite that bad. I zeroed on the
 Beta Circinus beacon and ran a complicated eight-point problem through
 the navigator, using every beacon I could get an accurate fix on. The
 computer gave me a course with an estimated point-of-arrival as well as
 a built-in safety factor I never could eliminate from the machine.


 I would much rather take a chance of breaking through near some star
 than spend time just barreling through normal space, but apparently Tech
 knows this, too. They had a safety factor built into the computer so you
 couldn’t end up inside a star no matter how hard you tried.
 I’m sure there was no humaneness in this decision. They just
 didn’t want to lose the ship.
It
 was a twenty-hour jump, ship’s time, and I came through in the
 middle of nowhere. The robot analyzer chuckled to itself and scanned all
 the stars, comparing them to the spectra of Proxima Centauri. It finally
 rang a bell and blinked a light. I peeped through the eyepiece.


 A fast reading with the photocell gave me the apparent magnitude and a
 comparison with its absolute magnitude showed its distance. Not as bad
 as I had thought—a six-week run, give or take a few days. After
 feeding a course tape into the robot pilot, I strapped into the
 acceleration tank and went to sleep.


 The time went fast. I rebuilt my camera for about the twentieth time and
 just about finished a correspondence course in nucleonics. Most
 repairmen take these courses. Besides their always coming in handy, the
 company grades your pay by the number of specialties you can handle. All
 this, with some oil painting and free-fall workouts in the gym, passed
 the time. I was asleep when the alarm went off that announced planetary
 distance.


 Planet two, where the beacon was situated according to the old charts,
 was a mushy-looking, wet kind of globe. I tried to make sense out of
 the ancient directions and finally located the right area. Staying
 outside the atmosphere, I sent a flying eye down to look things over. In
 this business, you learn early when and where to risk your own skin. The
 eye would be good enough for the preliminary survey.


 The old boys had enough brains to choose a traceable site for the
 beacon, equidistant on a line between two of the most prominent mountain
 peaks. I located the peaks easily enough and started the eye out from
 the first peak and kept it on a course directly toward the second. There
 was a nose and tail radar in the eye and I fed their signals into a
 scope as an amplitude curve. When the two peaks coincided, I spun the
 eye controls and dived the thing down.


 I cut out the radar and cut in the nose orthicon and sat back to watch
 the beacon appear on the screen.


 The image blinked, focused—and a great damn pyramid swam into
 view. I cursed and wheeled the eye in circles, scanning the surrounding
 country. It was flat, marshy bottom land without a bump. The only thing
 in a ten-mile circle was this pyramid—and that definitely
 wasn’t my beacon.


 Or wasn’t it?


 I dived the eye lower. The pyramid was a crude-looking thing of
 undressed stone, without carvings or decorations. There was a shimmer of
 light from the top and I took a closer look at it. On the peak of the
 pyramid was a hollow basin filled with water. When I saw that, something
 clicked in my mind.
Locking
 the eye in a circular course, I dug through the Mark III
 plans—and there it was. The beacon had a precipitating field and a
 basin on top of it for water; this was used to cool the reactor that
 powered the monstrosity. If the water was still there, the beacon was
 still there—inside the pyramid. The natives, who, of course,
 weren’t even mentioned by the idiots who constructed the thing,
 had built a nice heavy, thick stone pyramid around the beacon.


 I took another look at the screen and realized that I had locked the eye
 into a circular orbit about twenty feet above the pyramid. The summit of
 the stone pile was now covered with lizards of some type, apparently the
 local life-form. They had what looked like throwing sticks and arbalasts
 and were trying to shoot down the eye, a cloud of arrows and rocks
 flying in every direction.


 I pulled the eye straight up and away and threw in the control circuit
 that would return it automatically to the ship.


 Then I went to the galley for a long, strong drink. My beacon was not
 only locked inside a mountain of handmade stone, but I had managed to
 irritate the things who had built the pyramid. A great beginning for a
 job and one clearly designed to drive a stronger man than me to the
 bottle.


 Normally, a repairman stays away from native cultures. They are poison.
 Anthropologists may not mind being dissected for their science, but a
 repairman wants to make no sacrifices of any kind for his job. For this
 reason, most beacons are built on uninhabited planets. If a beacon
 has
 to go on a planet with a culture, it is usually built in some
 inaccessible place.


 Why this beacon had been built within reach of the local claws, I had
 yet to find out. But that would come in time. The first thing to do was
 make contact. To make contact, you have to know the local language.


 And, for
 that
 , I had long before worked out a system that was
 fool-proof.


 I had a pryeye of my own construction. It looked like a piece of rock
 about a foot long. Once on the ground, it would never be noticed, though
 it was a little disconcerting to see it float by. I located a lizard
 town about a thousand kilometers from the pyramid and dropped the eye.
 It swished down and landed at night in the bank of the local mud wallow.
 This was a favorite spot that drew a good crowd during the day. In the
 morning, when the first wallowers arrived, I flipped on the recorder.


 After about five of the local days, I had a sea of native conversation
 in the memory bank of the machine translator and had tagged a few
 expressions. This is fairly easy to do when you have a machine memory to
 work with. One of the lizards gargled at another one and the second one
 turned around. I tagged this expression with the phrase, “Hey,
 George!” and waited my chance to use it. Later the same day, I
 caught one of them alone and shouted “Hey, George!” at him.
 It gurgled out through the speaker in the local tongue and he turned
 around.


 When you get enough reference phrases like this in the memory bank, the
 MT brain takes over and starts filling in the missing pieces. As soon as
 the MT could give a running translation of any conversation it heard, I
 figured it was time to make a contact.
I found
 him easily enough. He was the Centaurian version of a
 goat-boy—he herded a particularly loathsome form of local life in
 the swamps outside the town. I had one of the working eyes dig a cave in
 an outcropping of rock and wait for him.


 When he passed next day, I whispered into the mike: “Welcome, O
 Goat-boy Grandson! This is your grandfather’s spirit speaking from
 paradise.” This fitted in with what I could make out of the local
 religion.


 Goat-boy stopped as if he’d been shot. Before he could move, I
 pushed a switch and a handful of the local currency, wampum-type shells,
 rolled out of the cave and landed at his feet.


 “Here is some money from paradise, because you have been a good
 boy.” Not really from paradise—I had lifted it from the
 treasury the night before. “Come back tomorrow and we will talk
 some more,” I called after the fleeing figure. I was pleased to
 notice that he took the cash before taking off.


 After that, Grandpa in paradise had many heart-to-heart talks with
 Grandson, who found the heavenly loot more than he could resist. Grandpa
 had been out of touch with things since his death and Goat-boy happily
 filled him in.


 I learned all I needed to know of the history, past and recent, and it
 wasn’t nice.


 In addition to the pyramid being around the beacon, there was a nice
 little religious war going on around the pyramid.


 It all began with the land bridge. Apparently the local lizards had been
 living in the swamps when the beacon was built, but the builders
 didn’t think much of them. They were a low type and confined to a
 distant continent. The idea that the race would develop and might reach
 this
 continent never occurred to the beacon mechanics. Which is, of
 course, what happened.


 A little geological turnover, a swampy land bridge formed in the right
 spot, and the lizards began to wander up beacon valley. And found
 religion. A shiny metal temple out of which poured a constant stream of
 magic water—the reactor-cooling water pumped down from the
 atmosphere condenser on the roof. The radioactivity in the water
 didn’t hurt the natives. It caused mutations that bred true.


 A city was built around the temple and, through the centuries, the
 pyramid was put up around the beacon. A special branch of the priesthood
 served the temple. All went well until one of the priests violated the
 temple and destroyed the holy waters. There had been revolt, strife,
 murder and destruction since then. But still the holy waters would not
 flow. Now armed mobs fought around the temple each day and a new band of
 priests guarded the sacred fount.


 And I had to walk into the middle of that mess and repair the thing.


 It would have been easy enough if we were allowed a little mayhem. I
 could have had a lizard fry, fixed the beacon and taken off. Only
 “native life-forms” were quite well protected. There were
 spy cells on my ship, all of which I hadn’t found, that would
 cheerfully rat on me when I got back.


 Diplomacy was called for. I sighed and dragged out the plastiflesh
 equipment.
Working
 from 3D snaps of Grandson, I modeled a passable reptile head
 over my own features. It was a little short in the jaw, me not having
 one of their toothy mandibles, but that was all right. I didn’t
 have to look
 exactly
 like them, just something close, to soothe the
 native mind. It’s logical. If I were an ignorant aborigine of
 Earth and I ran into a Spican, who looks like a two-foot gob of dried
 shellac, I would immediately leave the scene. However, if the Spican was
 wearing a suit of plastiflesh that looked remotely humanoid, I would at
 least stay and talk to him. This was what I was aiming to do with the
 Centaurians.


 When the head was done, I peeled it off and attached it to an attractive
 suit of green plastic, complete with tail. I was really glad they had
 tails. The lizards didn’t wear clothes and I wanted to take along
 a lot of electronic equipment. I built the tail over a metal frame that
 anchored around my waist. Then I filled the frame with all the equipment
 I would need and began to wire the suit.


 When it was done, I tried it on in front of a full-length mirror. It was
 horrible but effective. The tail dragged me down in the rear and gave me
 a duck-waddle, but that only helped the resemblance.


 That night I took the ship down into the hills nearest the pyramid, an
 out-of-the-way dry spot where the amphibious natives would never go. A
 little before dawn, the eye hooked onto my shoulders and we sailed
 straight up. We hovered above the temple at about 2,000 meters, until it
 was light, then dropped straight down.


 It must have been a grand sight. The eye was camouflaged to look like a
 flying lizard, sort of a cardboard pterodactyl, and the slowly flapping
 wings obviously had nothing to do with our flight. But it was impressive
 enough for the natives. The first one that spotted me screamed and
 dropped over on his back. The others came running. They milled and
 mobbed and piled on top of one another, and by that time I had landed in
 the plaza fronting the temple. The priesthood arrived.


 I folded my arms in a regal stance. “Greetings, O noble servers of
 the Great God,” I said. Of course I didn’t say it out loud,
 just whispered loud enough for the throat mike to catch. This was
 radioed back to the MT and the translation shot back to a speaker in my
 jaws.


 The natives chomped and rattled and the translation rolled out almost
 instantly. I had the volume turned up and the whole square echoed.


 Some of the more credulous natives prostrated themselves and others fled
 screaming. One doubtful type raised a spear, but no one else tried that
 after the pterodactyl-eye picked him up and dropped him in the swamp.
 The priests were a hard-headed lot and weren’t buying any lizards
 in a poke; they just stood and muttered. I had to take the offensive
 again.


 “Begone, O faithful steed,” I said to the eye, and pressed
 the control in my palm at the same time.


 It took off straight up a bit faster than I wanted; little pieces of
 wind-torn plastic rained down. While the crowd was ogling this ascent, I
 walked through the temple doors.


 “I would talk with you, O noble priests,” I said.


 Before they could think up a good answer, I was inside.
The
 temple was a small one built against the base of the pyramid. I
 hoped I wasn’t breaking too many taboos by going in. I
 wasn’t stopped, so it looked all right. The temple was a single
 room with a murky-looking pool at one end. Sloshing in the pool was an
 ancient reptile who clearly was one of the leaders. I waddled toward him
 and he gave me a cold and fishy eye, then growled something.


 The MT whispered into my ear, “Just what in the name of the
 thirteenth sin are you and what are you doing here?”


 I drew up my scaly figure in a noble gesture and pointed toward the
 ceiling. “I come from your ancestors to help you. I am here to
 restore the Holy Waters.”


 This raised a buzz of conversation behind me, but got no rise out of the
 chief. He sank slowly into the water until only his eyes were showing. I
 could almost hear the wheels turning behind that moss-covered forehead.
 Then he lunged up and pointed a dripping finger at me.


 “You are a liar! You are no ancestor of ours! We
 will—”


 “Stop!” I thundered before he got so far in that he
 couldn’t back out. “I said your ancestors sent me as
 emissary—I am not one of your ancestors. Do not try to harm me or
 the wrath of those who have Passed On will turn against you.”


 When I said this, I turned to jab a claw at the other priests, using the
 motion to cover my flicking a coin grenade toward them. It blew a nice
 hole in the floor with a great show of noise and smoke.


 The First Lizard knew I was talking sense then and immediately called a
 meeting of the shamans. It, of course, took place in the public bathtub
 and I had to join them there. We jawed and gurgled for about an hour and
 settled all the major points.


 I found out that they were new priests; the previous ones had all been
 boiled for letting the Holy Waters cease. They found out I was there
 only to help them restore the flow of the waters. They bought this,
 tentatively, and we all heaved out of the tub and trickled muddy paths
 across the floor. There was a bolted and guarded door that led into the
 pyramid proper. While it was being opened, the First Lizard turned to
 me.


 “Undoubtedly you know of the rule,” he said. “Because
 the old priests did pry and peer, it was ruled henceforth that only the
 blind could enter the Holy of Holies.” I’d swear he was
 smiling, if thirty teeth peeking out of what looked like a crack in an
 old suitcase can be called smiling.


 He was also signaling to him an underpriest who carried a brazier of
 charcoal complete with red-hot irons. All I could do was stand and watch
 as he stirred up the coals, pulled out the ruddiest iron and turned
 toward me. He was just drawing a bead on my right eyeball when my brain
 got back in gear.


 “Of course,” I said, “blinding is only right. But in
 my case you will have to blind me before I
 leave
 the Holy of Holies, not
 now. I need my eyes to see and mend the Fount of Holy Waters. Once the
 waters flow again, I will laugh as I hurl myself on the burning
 iron.”
He
 took a good thirty seconds to think it over and had to agree with me.
 The local torturer sniffled a bit and threw a little more charcoal on
 the fire. The gate crashed open and I stalked through; then it banged to
 behind me and I was alone in the dark.


 But not for long—there was a shuffling nearby and I took a chance
 and turned on my flash. Three priests were groping toward me, their
 eye-sockets red pits of burned flesh. They knew what I wanted and led
 the way without a word.


 A crumbling and cracked stone stairway brought us up to a solid metal
 doorway labeled in archaic script
 MARK III BEACON—AUTHORIZED
 PERSONNEL ONLY
 . The trusting builders counted on the sign to do the
 whole job, for there wasn’t a trace of a lock on the door. One
 lizard merely turned the handle and we were inside the beacon.


 I unzipped the front of my camouflage suit and pulled out the
 blueprints. With the faithful priests stumbling after me, I located the
 control room and turned on the lights. There was a residue of charge in
 the emergency batteries, just enough to give a dim light. The meters and
 indicators looked to be in good shape; if anything, unexpectedly bright
 from constant polishing.


 I checked the readings carefully and found just what I had suspected.
 One of the eager lizards had managed to open a circuit box and had
 polished the switches inside. While doing this, he had thrown one of the
 switches and that had caused the trouble.
Rather
 , that had
 started
 the trouble. It wasn’t going to be ended
 by just reversing the water-valve switch. This valve was supposed to be
 used only for repairs, after the pile was damped. When the water was cut
 off with the pile in operation, it had started to overheat and the
 automatic safeties had dumped the charge down the pit.


 I could start the water again easily enough, but there was no fuel left
 in the reactor.


 I wasn’t going to play with the fuel problem at all. It would be
 far easier to install a new power plant. I had one in the ship that was
 about a tenth the size of the ancient bucket of bolts and produced at
 least four times the power. Before I sent for it, I checked over the
 rest of the beacon. In 2000 years, there should be
 some
 sign of wear.


 The old boys had built well, I’ll give them credit for that.
 Ninety per cent of the machinery had no moving parts and had suffered no
 wear whatever. Other parts they had beefed up, figuring they would wear,
 but slowly. The water-feed pipe from the roof, for example. The pipe
 walls were at least three meters thick—and the pipe opening itself
 no bigger than my head. There were some things I could do, though, and I
 made a list of parts.


 The parts, the new power plant and a few other odds and ends were chuted
 into a neat pile on the ship. I checked all the parts by screen before
 they were loaded in a metal crate. In the darkest hour before dawn, the
 heavy-duty eye dropped the crate outside the temple and darted away
 without being seen.


 I watched the priests through the pryeye while they tried to open it.
 When they had given up, I boomed orders at them through a speaker in the
 crate. They spent most of the day sweating the heavy box up through the
 narrow temple stairs and I enjoyed a good sleep. It was resting inside
 the beacon door when I woke up.
The
 repairs didn’t take long, though there was plenty of groaning
 from the blind lizards when they heard me ripping the wall open to get
 at the power leads. I even hooked a gadget to the water pipe so their
 Holy Waters would have the usual refreshing radioactivity when they
 started flowing again. The moment this was all finished, I did the job
 they were waiting for.


 I threw the switch that started the water flowing again.


 There were a few minutes while the water began to gurgle down through
 the dry pipe. Then a roar came from outside the pyramid that must have
 shaken its stone walls. Shaking my hands once over my head, I went down
 for the eye-burning ceremony.


 The blind lizards were waiting for me by the door and looked even
 unhappier than usual. When I tried the door, I found out why—it
 was bolted and barred from the other side.


 “It has been decided,” a lizard said, “that you shall
 remain here forever and tend the Holy Waters. We will stay with you and
 serve your every need.”


 A delightful prospect, eternity spent in a locked beacon with three
 blind lizards. In spite of their hospitality, I couldn’t accept.


 “What—you dare interfere with the messenger of your
 ancestors!” I had the speaker on full volume and the vibration
 almost shook my head off.


 The lizards cringed and I set my Solar for a narrow beam and ran it
 around the door jamb. There was a great crunching and banging from the
 junk piled against it, and then the door swung free. I threw it open.
 Before they could protest, I had pushed the priests out through it.


 The rest of their clan showed up at the foot of the stairs and made a
 great ruckus while I finished welding the door shut. Running through the
 crowd, I faced up to the First Lizard in his tub. He sank slowly beneath
 the surface.


 “What lack of courtesy!” I shouted. He made little bubbles
 in the water. “The ancestors are annoyed and have decided to
 forbid entrance to the Inner Temple forever; though, out of kindness,
 they will let the waters flow. Now I must return—on with the
 ceremony!”


 The torture-master was too frightened to move, so I grabbed out his hot
 iron. A touch on the side of my face dropped a steel plate over my eyes,
 under the plastiskin. Then I jammed the iron hard into my phony
 eye-sockets and the plastic gave off an authentic odor.


 A cry went up from the crowd as I dropped the iron and staggered in
 blind circles. I must admit it went off pretty well.
Before
 they could get any more bright ideas, I threw the switch and my
 plastic pterodactyl sailed in through the door. I couldn’t see it,
 of course, but I knew it had arrived when the grapples in the claws
 latched onto the steel plates on my shoulders.


 I had got turned around after the eye-burning and my flying beast hooked
 onto me backward. I had meant to sail out bravely, blind eyes facing
 into the sunset; instead, I faced the crowd as I soared away, so I made
 the most of a bad situation and threw them a snappy military salute.
 Then I was out in the fresh air and away.


 When I lifted the plate and poked holes in the seared plastic, I could
 see the pyramid growing smaller behind me, water gushing out of the base
 and a happy crowd of reptiles sporting in its radioactive rush. I
 counted off on my talons to see if I had forgotten anything.


 One: The beacon was repaired.


 Two: The door was sealed, so there should be no more sabotage,
 accidental or deliberate.


 Three: The priests should be satisfied. The water was running again, my
 eyes had been duly burned out, and they were back in business. Which
 added up to—


 Four: The fact that they would probably let another repairman in, under
 the same conditions, if the beacon conked out again. At least I had done
 nothing, like butchering a few of them, that would make them
 antagonistic toward future ancestral messengers.


 I stripped off my tattered lizard suit back in the ship, very glad that
 it would be some other repairman who’d get the job.

To the men of the future, the scientific

 goals of today were as incomprehensible

 as the ancient quest for the Holy Grail!
There was a thump. Maitland stirred, came half awake, and opened his
 eyes. The room was dark except where a broad shaft of moonlight from
 the open window fell on the foot of his bed. Outside, the residential
 section of the Reservation slept silently under the pale illumination
 of the full Moon. He guessed sleepily that it was about three o'clock.


 What had he heard? He had a definite impression that the sound had come
 from within the room. It had sounded like someone stumbling into a
 chair, or—


 Something moved in the darkness on the other side of the room. Maitland
 started to sit up and it was as though a thousand volts had shorted his
 brain....


 This time, he awoke more normally. He opened his eyes, looked through
 the window at a section of azure sky, listened to the singing of birds
 somewhere outside. A beautiful day. In the middle of the process of
 stretching his rested muscles, arms extended back, legs tensed, he
 froze, looking up—for the first time really seeing the ceiling. He
 turned his head, then rolled off the bed, wide awake.
This wasn't his room!
The lawn outside wasn't part of the Reservation! Where the labs and
 the shops should have been, there was deep prairie grass, then a green
 ocean pushed into waves by the breeze stretching to the horizon. This
 wasn't the California desert! Down the hill, where the liquid oxygen
 plant ought to have been, a river wound across the scene, almost hidden
 beneath its leafy roof of huge ancient trees.


 Shock contracted Maitland's diaphragm and spread through his body.
 His breathing quickened.
Now
he remembered what had happened during
 the night, the sound in the darkness, the dimly seen figure, and
 then—what? Blackout....


 Where was he? Who had brought him here? For what purpose?


 He thought he knew the answer to the last of those questions. As
 a member of the original atomic reaction-motor team, he possessed
 information that other military powers would very much like to obtain.
 It was absolutely incredible that anyone had managed to abduct him from
 the heavily guarded confines of the Reservation, yet someone had done
 it. How?
He pivoted to inspect the room. Even before his eyes could take in
 the details, he had the impression that there was something wrong
 about it. To begin with, the style was unfamiliar. There were no
 straight lines or sharp corners anywhere. The walls were paneled in
 featureless blue plastic and the doors were smooth surfaces of metal,
 half ellipses, without knobs. The flowing lines of the chair and table,
 built apparently from an aluminum alloy, somehow gave the impression
 of arrested motion. Even after allowances were made for the outlandish
 design, something about the room still was not right.


 His eyes returned to the doors, and he moved over to study the nearer
 one. As he had noticed, there was no knob, but at the right of this
 one, at about waist level, a push-button projected out of the wall. He
 pressed it; the door slid aside and disappeared. Maitland glanced in at
 the disclosed bathroom, then went over to look at the other door.


 There was no button beside this one, nor any other visible means of
 causing it to open.


 Baffled, he turned again and looked at the large open window—and
 realized what it was that had made the room seem so queer.


 It did not look like a jail cell. There were no bars....


 Striding across the room, he lunged forward to peer out and violently
 banged his forehead. He staggered back, grimacing with pain, then
 reached forward cautious fingers and discovered a hard sheet of stuff
 so transparent that he had not even suspected its presence. Not glass!
 Glass was never this clear or strong. A plastic, no doubt, but one he
 hadn't heard of. Security sometimes had disadvantages.


 He looked out at the peaceful vista of river and prairie. The character
 of the sunlight seemed to indicate that it was afternoon. He became
 aware that he was hungry.


 Where the devil could this place be? And—muscles tightened about his
 empty stomach—what was in store for him here?


 He stood trembling, acutely conscious that he was afraid and helpless,
 until a flicker of motion at the bottom of the hill near the river drew
 his attention. Pressing his nose against the window, he strained his
 eyes to see what it was.


 A man and a woman were coming toward him up the hill. Evidently they
 had been swimming, for each had a towel; the man's was hung around his
 neck, and the woman was still drying her bobbed black hair.


 Maitland speculated on the possibility that this might be Sweden; he
 didn't know of any other country where public bathing at this time
 of year was customary. However, that prairie certainly didn't look
 Scandinavian....


 As they came closer, he saw that both of them had dark uniform suntans
 and showed striking muscular development, like persons who had trained
 for years with weights. They vanished below his field of view,
 presumably into the building.


 He sat down on the edge of the cot and glared helplessly at the floor.
About half an hour later, the door he couldn't open slid aside into the
 wall. The man Maitland had seen outside, now clad in gray trunks and
 sandals, stood across the threshold looking in at him. Maitland stood
 up and stared back, conscious suddenly that in his rumpled pajamas he
 made an unimpressive figure.


 The fellow looked about forty-five. The first details Maitland noticed
 were the forehead, which was quite broad, and the calm, clear eyes.
 The dark hair, white at the temples, was combed back, still damp from
 swimming. Below, there was a wide mouth and a firm, rounded chin.


 This man was intelligent, Maitland decided, and extremely sure of
 himself.


 Somehow, the face didn't go with the rest of him. The man had the head
 of a thinker, the body of a trained athlete—an unusual combination.


 Impassively, the man said, ""My name is Swarts. You want to know where
 you are. I am not going to tell you."" He had an accent, European, but
 otherwise unidentifiable. Possibly German. Maitland opened his mouth
 to protest, but Swarts went on, ""However, you're free to do all the
 guessing you want."" Still there was no suggestion of a smile.


 ""Now, these are the rules. You'll be here for about a week. You'll have
 three meals a day, served in this room. You will not be allowed to
 leave it except when accompanied by myself. You will not be harmed in
 any way, provided you cooperate. And you can forget the silly idea that
 we want your childish secrets about rocket motors."" Maitland's heart
 jumped. ""My reason for bringing you here is altogether different. I
 want to give you some psychological tests....""


 ""Are you crazy?"" Maitland asked quietly. ""Do you realize that at this
 moment one of the greatest hunts in history must be going on? I'll
 admit I'm baffled as to where we are and how you got me here—but it
 seems to me that you could have found someone less conspicuous to give
 your tests to.""


 Briefly, then, Swarts did smile. ""They won't find you,"" he said. ""Now,
 come with me.""
After that outlandish cell, Swarts' laboratory looked rather
 commonplace. There was something like a surgical cot in the center, and
 a bench along one wall supported several electronics cabinets. A couple
 of them had cathode ray tube screens, and they all presented a normal
 complement of meters, pilot lights, and switches. Cables from them ran
 across the ceiling and came to a focus above the high flat cot in the
 center of the room.


 ""Lie down,"" Swarts said. When Maitland hesitated, Swarts added,
 ""Understand one thing—the more you cooperate, the easier things will
 be for you. If necessary, I will use coercion. I can get all my results
 against your will, if I must. I would prefer not to. Please don't make
 me.""


 ""What's the idea?"" Maitland asked. ""What is all this?""


 Swarts hesitated, though not, Maitland astonishedly felt, to evade an
 answer, but to find the proper words. ""You can think of it as a lie
 detector. These instruments will record your reactions to the tests I
 give you. That is as much as you need to know. Now lie down.""


 Maitland stood there for a moment, deliberately relaxing his tensed
 muscles. ""Make me.""


 If Swarts was irritated, he didn't show it. ""That was the first test,""
 he said. ""Let me put it another way. I would appreciate it a lot if
 you'd lie down on this cot. I would like to test my apparatus.""


 Maitland shook his head stubbornly.


 ""I see,"" Swarts said. ""You want to find out what you're up against.""


 He moved so fast that Maitland couldn't block the blow. It was to the
 solar plexus, just hard enough to double him up, fighting for breath.
 He felt an arm under his back, another behind his knees. Then he was on
 the cot. When he was able to breathe again, there were straps across
 his chest, hips, knees, ankles, and arms, and Swarts was tightening a
 clamp that held his head immovable.
Presently, a number of tiny electrodes were adhering to his temples and
 to other portions of his body, and a minute microphone was clinging to
 the skin over his heart. These devices terminated in cables that hung
 from the ceiling. A sphygmomanometer sleeve was wrapped tightly around
 his left upper arm, its rubber tube trailing to a small black box
 clamped to the frame of the cot. Another cable left the box and joined
 the others.


 So—Maitland thought—Swarts could record changes in his skin
 potential, heartbeat, and blood pressure: the involuntary responses of
 the body to stimuli.


 The question was, what were the stimuli to be?


 ""Your name,"" said Swarts, ""is Robert Lee Maitland. You are thirty-four
 years old. You are an engineer, specialty heat transfer, particularly
 as applied to rocket motors.... No, Mr. Maitland, I'm not going to
 question you about your work; just forget about it. Your home town is
 Madison, Wisconsin....""


 ""You seem to know everything about me,"" Maitland said defiantly,
 looking up into the hanging forest of cabling. ""Why this recital?""


 ""I do not know everything about you—yet. And I'm testing the
 equipment, calibrating it to your reactions."" He went on, ""Your
 favorite recreations are chess and reading what you term science
 fiction. Maitland,
how would you like to go to the Moon
?""


 Something eager leaped in Maitland's breast at the abrupt question, and
 he tried to turn his head. Then he forced himself to relax. ""What do
 you mean?""


 Swarts was chuckling. ""I really hit a semantic push-button there,
 didn't I? Maitland, I brought you here because you're a man who wants
 to go to the Moon. I'm interested in finding out
why
.""
In the evening a girl brought Maitland his meal. As the door slid
 aside, he automatically stood up, and they stared at each other for
 several seconds.


 She had the high cheekbones and almond eyes of an Oriental, skin that
 glowed like gold in the evening light, yet thick coiled braids of
 blonde hair that glittered like polished brass. Shorts and a sleeveless
 blouse of some thick, reddish, metallic-looking fabric clung to her
 body, and over that she was wearing a light, ankle-length cloak of what
 seemed to be white wool.


 She was looking at him with palpable curiosity and something like
 expectancy. Maitland sighed and said, ""Hello,"" then glanced down
 self-consciously at his wrinkled green pajamas.
She smiled, put the tray of food on the table, and swept out, her cloak
 billowing behind her. Maitland remained standing, staring at the closed
 door for a minute after she was gone.


 Later, when he had finished the steak and corn on the cob and shredded
 carrots, and a feeling of warm well-being was diffusing from his
 stomach to his extremities, he sat down on the bed to watch the sunset
 and to think.


 There were three questions for which he required answers before he
 could formulate any plan or policy.


 Where was he?


 Who was Swarts?


 What was the purpose of the ""tests"" he was being given?


 It was possible, of course, that this was all an elaborate scheme
 for getting military secrets, despite Swarts' protestations to the
 contrary. Maitland frowned. This place certainly didn't have the
 appearance of a military establishment, and so far there had been
 nothing to suggest the kind of interrogation to be expected from
 foreign intelligence officers.


 It might be better to tackle the first question first. He looked at
 the Sun, a red spheroid already half below the horizon, and tried to
 think of a region that had this kind of terrain. That prairie out there
 was unique. Almost anywhere in the world, land like that would be
 cultivated, not allowed to go to grass.


 This might be somewhere in Africa....


 He shook his head, puzzled. The Sun disappeared and its blood-hued
 glow began to fade from the sky. Maitland sat there, trying to get
 hold of the problem from an angle where it wouldn't just slip away.
 After a while the western sky became a screen of clear luminous blue,
 a backdrop for a pure white brilliant star. As always at that sight,
 Maitland felt his worry drain away, leaving an almost mystical sense of
 peace and an undefinable longing.


 Venus, the most beautiful of the planets.


 Maitland kept track of them all in their majestic paths through the
 constellations, but Venus was his favorite. Time and time again he
 had watched its steady climb higher and higher in the western sky,
 its transient rule there as evening star, its progression toward the
 horizon, and loved it equally in its
alter ego
of morning star. Venus
 was an old friend. An old friend....


 Something icy settled on the back of his neck, ran down his spine, and
 diffused into his body. He stared at the planet unbelievingly, fists
 clenched, forgetting to breathe.


 Last night Venus hadn't been there.


 Venus was a morning star just now....
Just now!
He realized the truth in that moment.
Later, when that jewel of a planet had set and the stars were out,
 he lay on the bed, still warm with excitement and relief. He didn't
 have to worry any more about military secrets, or who Swarts was.
 Those questions were irrelevant now. And now he could accept the
 psychological tests at their face value; most likely, they were what
 they purported to be.


 Only one question of importance remained:


 What year was this?


 He grimaced in the darkness, an involuntary muscular expression of
 jubilation and excitement. The
future
! Here was the opportunity for
 the greatest adventure imaginable to 20th Century man.


 Somewhere, out there under the stars, there must be grand glittering
 cities and busy spaceports, roaring gateways to the planets.
 Somewhere, out there in the night, there must be men who had walked
 beside the Martian canals and pierced the shining cloud mantle of
 Venus—somewhere, perhaps, men who had visited the distant luring stars
 and returned. Surely, a civilization that had developed time travel
 could reach the stars!


 And
he
had a chance to become a part of all that! He could spend
 his life among the planets, a citizen of deep space, a voyager of the
 challenging spaceways between the solar worlds.


 ""I'm adaptable,"" he told himself gleefully. ""I can learn fast. There'll
 be a job for me out there....""
If—
Suddenly sobered, he rolled over and put his feet on the floor, sat
 in the darkness thinking. Tomorrow. Tomorrow he would have to find a
 way of breaking down Swarts' reticence. He would have to make the man
 realize that secrecy wasn't necessary in this case. And if Swarts still
 wouldn't talk, he would have to find a way of forcing the issue. The
 fellow had said that he didn't need cooperation to get his results,
 but—


 After a while Maitland smiled to himself and went back to bed.
He woke in the morning with someone gently shaking his shoulder. He
 rolled over and looked up at the girl who had brought him his meal the
 evening before. There was a tray on the table and he sniffed the smell
 of bacon. The girl smiled at him. She was dressed as before, except
 that she had discarded the white cloak.


 As he swung his legs to the floor, she started toward the door,
 carrying the tray with the dirty dishes from yesterday. He stopped her
 with the word, ""Miss!""


 She turned, and he thought there was something eager in her face.


 ""Miss, do you speak my language?""


 ""Yes,"" hesitantly. She lingered too long on the hiss of the last
 consonant.


 ""Miss,"" he asked, watching her face intently, ""what year is this?""


 Startlingly, she laughed, a mellow peal of mirth that had nothing
 forced about it. She turned toward the door again and said over her
 shoulder, ""You will have to ask Swarts about that. I cannot tell you.""


 ""Wait! You mean you don't know?""


 She shook her head. ""I cannot tell you.""


 ""All right; we'll let it go at that.""


 She grinned at him again as the door slid shut.
Swarts came half an hour later, and Maitland began his planned
 offensive.


 ""What year is this?""


 Swarts' steely eyes locked with his. ""You know what the date is,"" he
 stated.


 ""No, I don't. Not since yesterday.""


 ""Come on,"" Swarts said patiently, ""let's get going. We have a lot to
 get through this morning.""


 ""I
know
this isn't 1950. It's probably not even the 20th Century.
 Venus was a morning star before you brought me here. Now it's an
 evening star.""


 ""Never mind that. Come.""


 Wordlessly, Maitland climbed to his feet, preceded Swarts to the
 laboratory, lay down and allowed him to fasten the straps and attach
 the instruments, making no resistance at all. When Swarts started
 saying a list of words—doubtlessly some sort of semantic reaction
 test—Maitland began the job of integrating ""csc
 3
 x dx"" in his head.
 It was a calculation which required great concentration and frequent
 tracing back of steps. After several minutes, he noticed that Swarts
 had stopped calling words. He opened his eyes to find the other man
 standing over him, looking somewhat exasperated and a little baffled.


 ""What year is this?"" Maitland asked in a conversational tone.


 ""We'll try another series of tests.""


 It took Swarts nearly twenty minutes to set up the new apparatus. He
 lowered a bulky affair with two cylindrical tubes like the twin stacks
 of a binocular microscope over Maitland's head, so that the lenses at
 the ends of the tubes were about half an inch from the engineer's
 eyes. He attached tiny clamps to Maitland's eyelashes.


 ""These will keep you from holding your eyes shut,"" he said. ""You can
 blink, but the springs are too strong for you to hold your eyelids down
 against the tension.""


 He inserted button earphones into Maitland's ears—


 And then the show began.


 He was looking at a door in a partly darkened room, and there were
 footsteps outside, a peremptory knocking. The door flew open,
 and outlined against the light of the hall, he saw a man with a
 twelve-gauge shotgun. The man shouted, ""Now I've got you, you
 wife-stealer!"" He swung the shotgun around and pulled the trigger.
 There was a terrible blast of sound and the flash of smokeless
 powder—then blackness.


 With a deliberate effort, Maitland unclenched his fists and tried to
 slow his breathing. Some kind of emotional reaction test—what was the
 countermove? He closed his eyes, but shortly the muscles around them
 declared excruciatingly that they couldn't keep that up.


 Now he was looking at a girl. She....


 Maitland gritted his teeth and fought to use his brain; then he had it.


 He thought of a fat slob of a bully who had beaten him up one day
 after school. He remembered a talk he had heard by a politician who had
 all the intelligent social responsibility of a rogue gorilla, but no
 more. He brooded over the damnable stupidity and short-sightedness of
 Swarts in standing by his silly rules and not telling him about this
 new world.


 Within a minute, he was in an ungovernable rage. His muscles tightened
 against the restraining straps. He panted, sweat came out on his
 forehead, and he began to curse. Swarts! How he hated....


 The scene was suddenly a flock of sheep spread over a green hillside.
 There was blood hammering in Maitland's temples. His face felt hot and
 swollen and he writhed against the restraint of the straps.


 The scene disappeared, the lenses of the projector retreated from his
 eyes and Swarts was standing over him, white-lipped. Maitland swore at
 him for a few seconds, then relaxed and smiled weakly. His head was
 starting to ache from the effort of blinking.


 ""What year is this?"" he asked.


 ""All right,"" Swarts said. ""A.D. 2634.""


 Maitland's smile became a grin.
""I really haven't the time to waste talking irrelevancies,"" Swarts said
 a while later. ""Honestly. Maitland, I'm working against a time limit.
 If you'll cooperate, I'll tell Ching to answer your questions.""'


 ""Ching?""


 ""Ingrid Ching is the girl who has been bringing you your meals.""


 Maitland considered a moment, then nodded. Swarts lowered the projector
 to his eyes again, and this time the engineer did not resist.


 That evening, he could hardly wait for her to come. Too excited to sit
 and watch the sunset, he paced interminably about the room, sometimes
 whistling nervously, snapping his fingers, sitting down and jittering
 one leg. After a while he noticed that he was whistling the same theme
 over and over: a minute's thought identified it as that exuberant
 mounting phrase which recurs in the finale of Beethoven's Ninth
 Symphony.


 He forgot about it and went on whistling. He was picturing himself
 aboard a ship dropping in toward Mars, making planetfall at Syrtis
 Major; he was seeing visions of Venus and the awesome beauty of Saturn.
 In his mind, he circled the Moon, and viewed the Earth as a huge bright
 globe against the constellations....


 Finally the door slid aside and she appeared, carrying the usual tray
 of food. She smiled at him, making dimples in her golden skin and
 revealing a perfect set of teeth, and put the tray on the table.


 ""I think you are wonderful,"" she laughed. ""You get everything you
 want, even from Swarts, and I have not been able to get even a little
 of what I want from him. I want to travel in time, go back to your 20th
 Century. And I wanted to talk with you, and he would not let me."" She
 laughed again, hands on her rounded hips. ""I have never seen him so
 irritated as he was this noon.""


 Maitland urged her into the chair and sat down on the edge of the bed.
 Eagerly he asked, ""Why the devil do you want to go to the 20th Century?
 Believe me, I've been there, and what I've seen of this world looks a
 lot better.""


 She shrugged. ""Swarts says that I want to go back to the Dark Age of
 Technology because I have not adapted well to modern culture. Myself,
 I think I have just a romantic nature. Far times and places look more
 exciting....""


 ""How do you mean—"" Maitland wrinkled his brow—""adapt to modern
 culture? Don't tell me
you're
from another time!""


 ""Oh, no! But my home is Aresund, a little fishing village at the head
 of a fiord in what you would call Norway. So far north, we are much
 behind the times. We live in the old way, from the sea, speak the old
 tongue.""
He looked at her golden features, such a felicitous blend of
 Oriental and European characteristics, and hesitantly asked, ""Maybe
 I shouldn't.... This is a little personal, but ... you don't look
 altogether like the Norwegians of my time.""


 His fear that she would be offended proved to be completely
 unjustified. She merely laughed and said, ""There has been much
 history since 1950. Five hundred years ago, Europe was overrun by
 Pan-Orientals. Today you could not find anywhere a 'pure' European
 or Asiatic."" She giggled. ""Swarts' ancestors from your time must be
 cursing in their graves. His family is Afrikander all the way back, but
 one of his great-grandfathers was pure-blooded Bantu. His full name is
 Lassisi Swarts.""


 Maitland wrinkled his brow. ""Afrikander?""


 ""The South Africans."" Something strange came into her eyes. It might
 have been awe, or even hatred; he could not tell. ""The Pan-Orientals
 eventually conquered all the world, except for North America—the
 last remnant of the American World Empire—and southern Africa. The
 Afrikanders had been partly isolated for several centuries then, and
 they had developed technology while the rest of the world lost it. They
 had a tradition of white supremacy, and in addition they were terrified
 of being encircled."" She sighed. ""They ruled the next world empire and
 it was founded on the slaughter of one and a half billion human beings.
 That went into the history books as the War of Annihilation.""


 ""So many? How?""


 ""They were clever with machines, the Afrikanders. They made armies
 of them. Armies of invincible killing-machines, produced in robot
 factories from robot-mined ores.... Very clever."" She gave a little
 shudder.


 ""And yet they founded modern civilization,"" she added. ""The grandsons
 of the technicians who built the Machine Army set up our robot
 production system, and today no human being has to dirty his hands
 raising food or manufacturing things. It could never have been done,
 either, before the population was—reduced to three hundred million.""


 ""Then the Afrikanders are still on top? Still the masters?""
She shook her head. ""There are no more Afrikanders.""


 ""Rebellion?""


 ""No. Intermarriage. Racial blending. There was a psychology of guilt
 behind it. So huge a crime eventually required a proportionate
 expiation. Afrikaans is still the world language, but there is only one
 race now. No more masters or slaves.""


 They were both silent for a moment, and then she sighed. ""Let us not
 talk about them any more.""


 ""Robot factories and farms,"" Maitland mused. ""What else? What means of
 transportation? Do you have interstellar flight yet?""


 ""Inter-what?""


 ""Have men visited the stars?""


 She shook her head, bewildered.


 ""I always thought that would be a tough problem to crack,"" he agreed.
 ""But tell me about what men are doing in the Solar System. How is life
 on Mars and Venus, and how long does it take to get to those places?""


 He waited, expectantly silent, but she only looked puzzled. ""I don't
 understand. Mars? What are Mars?""


 After several seconds, Maitland swallowed. Something seemed to be the
 matter with his throat, making it difficult for him to speak. ""Surely
 you have space travel?""


 She frowned and shook her head. ""What does that mean—space travel?""


 He was gripping the edge of the bed now, glaring at her. ""A
 civilization that could discover time travel and build robot factories
 wouldn't find it hard to send a ship to Mars!""


 ""A
ship
? Oh, you mean something like a
vliegvlotter
. Why, no, I
 don't suppose it would be hard. But why would anyone want to do a
 thing like that?""


 He was on his feet towering over her, fists clenched. She raised her
 arms as if to shield her face if he should hit her. ""Let's get this
 perfectly clear,"" he said, more harshly than he realized. ""So far as
 you know, no one has ever visited the planets, and no one wants to. Is
 that right?""


 She nodded apprehensively. ""I have never heard of it being done.""


 He sank down on the bed and put his face in his hands. After a while he
 looked up and said bitterly, ""You're looking at a man who would give
 his life to get to Mars. I thought I would in my time. I was positive I
 would when I knew I was in your time. And now I know I never will.""
The cot creaked beside him and he felt a soft arm about his shoulders
 and fingers delicately stroking his brow. Presently he opened his eyes
 and looked at her. ""I just don't understand,"" he said. ""It seemed
 obvious to me that whenever men were able to reach the planets, they'd
 do it.""


 Her pitying eyes were on his face. He hitched himself around so that he
 was facing her. ""I've got to understand. I've got to know
why
. What
 happened? Why don't men want the planets any more?""


 ""Honestly,"" she said, ""I did not know they ever had."" She hesitated.
 ""Maybe you are asking the wrong question.""


 He furrowed his brow, bewildered now by her.


 ""I mean,"" she explained, ""maybe you should ask why people in the 20th
 Century
did
want to go to worlds men are not suited to inhabit.""


 Maitland felt his face become hot. ""Men can go anywhere, if they want
 to bad enough.""


 ""But
why
?""


 Despite his sudden irrational anger toward her, Maitland tried to stick
 to logic. ""Living space, for one thing. The only permanent solution to
 the population problem....""


 ""We have no population problem. A hundred years ago, we realized that
 the key to social stability is a limited population. Our economic
 system was built to take care of three hundred million people, and we
 have held the number at that.""


 ""Birth control,"" Maitland scoffed. ""How do you make it work—secret
 police?""


 ""No. Education. Each of us has the right to two children, and we
 cherish that right so much that we make every effort to see that those
 two are the best children we could possibly produce....""


 She broke off, looking a little self-conscious. ""You understand, what
 I have been saying applies to
most
of the world. In some places like
 Aresund, things are different. Backward. I still do not feel that I
 belong here, although the people of the town have accepted me as one of
 them.""


 ""Even,"" he said, ""granting that you have solved the population problem,
 there's still the adventure of the thing. Surely, somewhere, there must
 be men who still feel that.... Ingrid, doesn't it fire something in
 your blood, the idea of going to Mars—just to go there and see what's
 there and walk under a new sky and a smaller Sun? Aren't you interested
 in finding out what the canals are? Or what's under the clouds of
 Venus? Wouldn't you like to see the rings of Saturn from, a distance
 of only two hundred thousand miles?"" His hands were trembling as he
 stopped.


 She shrugged her shapely shoulders. ""Go into the past—yes! But go out
 there? I still cannot see why.""


 ""Has the spirit of adventure
evaporated
from the human race, or
what
?""


 She smiled. ""In a room downstairs there is the head of a lion. Swarts
 killed the beast when he was a young man. He used a spear. And time
 traveling is the greatest adventure there is. At least, that is the
 way I feel. Listen, Bob."" She laid a hand on his arm. ""You grew up in
 the Age of Technology. Everybody was terribly excited about what could
 be done with machines—machines to blow up a city all at once, or fly
 around the world, or take a man to Mars. We have had our fill of—what
 is the word?—gadgets. Our machines serve us, and so long as they
 function right, we are satisfied to forget about them.


 ""Because this is the Age of
Man
. We are terribly interested in what
 can be done with people. Our scientists, like Swarts, are studying
 human rather than nuclear reactions. We are much more fascinated by the
 life and death of cultures than by the expansion or contraction of the
 Universe. With us, it is the people that are important, not gadgets.""


 Maitland stared at her, his face blank. His mind had just manufactured
 a discouraging analogy. His present position was like that of an
 earnest 12th Century crusader, deposited by some freak of nature into
 the year 1950, trying to find a way of reanimating the anti-Mohammedan
 movement. What chance would he have? The unfortunate knight would argue
 in vain that the atomic bomb offered a means of finally destroying the
 infidel....


 Maitland looked up at the girl, who was regarding him silently with
 troubled eyes. ""I think I'd like to be alone for a while,"" he said.

By CHARLES L. FONTENAY
When you have an engine with no fuel, and fuel
 
without an engine, and a life-and-death deadline
 
to meet, you have a problem indeed. Unless you are
 
a stubborn Dutchman—and Jan Van Artevelde was
 
the stubbornest Dutchman on Venus.
JAN WILLEM van Artevelde
 claimed descent from William
 of Orange. He had no genealogy
 to prove it, but on Venus there
 was no one who could disprove it,
 either.


 Jan Willem van Artevelde
 smoked a clay pipe, which only a
 Dutchman can do properly, because
 the clay bit grates on less
 stubborn teeth.


 Jan needed all his Dutch stubbornness,
 and a good deal of pure
 physical strength besides, to maneuver
 the roach-flat groundcar
 across the tumbled terrain of
 Den Hoorn into the teeth of the
 howling gale that swept from the
 west. The huge wheels twisted
 and jolted against the rocks outside,
 and Jan bounced against his
 seat belt, wrestled the steering
 wheel and puffed at his
pijp
. The
 mild aroma of Heerenbaai-Tabak
 filled the airtight groundcar.


 There came a new swaying
 that was not the roughness of
 the terrain. Through the thick
 windshield Jan saw all the
 ground about him buckle and
 heave for a second or two before
 it settled to rugged quiescence
 again. This time he was really
 heaved about.


 Jan mentioned this to the
 groundcar radio.


 ""That's the third time in half
 an hour,"" he commented. ""The
 place tosses like the IJsselmeer
 on a rough day.""


 ""You just don't forget it
isn't
the Zuider Zee,"" retorted Heemskerk
 from the other end. ""You
 sink there and you don't come up
 three times.""


 ""Don't worry,"" said Jan. ""I'll
 be back on time, with a broom at
 the masthead.""


 ""This I shall want to see,""
 chuckled Heemskerk; a logical
 reaction, considering the scarcity
 of brooms on Venus.
Two hours earlier the two men
 had sat across a small table playing
 chess, with little indication
 there would be anything else to
 occupy their time before blastoff
 of the stubby gravity-boat. It
 would be their last chess game
 for many months, for Jan was a
 member of the Dutch colony at
 Oostpoort in the northern hemisphere
 of Venus, while Heemskerk
 was pilot of the G-boat from
 the Dutch spaceship
Vanderdecken
,
 scheduled to begin an
 Earthward orbit in a few hours.


 It was near the dusk of the
 485-hour Venerian day, and the
 Twilight Gale already had arisen,
 sweeping from the comparatively
 chill Venerian nightside into
 the superheated dayside. Oostpoort,
 established near some outcroppings
 that contained uranium
 ore, was protected from
 both the Dawn Gale and the Twilight
 Gale, for it was in a valley
 in the midst of a small range of
 mountains.


 Jan had just figured out a combination
 by which he hoped to
 cheat Heemskerk out of one of
 his knights, when Dekker, the
burgemeester
of Oostpoort, entered
 the spaceport ready room.


 ""There's been an emergency
 radio message,"" said Dekker.
 ""They've got a passenger for the
 Earthship over at Rathole.""


 ""Rathole?"" repeated Heemskerk.
 ""What's that? I didn't
 know there was another colony
 within two thousand kilometers.""


 ""It isn't a colony, in the sense
 Oostpoort is,"" explained Dekker.
 ""The people are the families of a
 bunch of laborers left behind
 when the colony folded several
 years ago. It's about eighty kilometers
 away, right across the
 Hoorn, but they don't have any
 vehicles that can navigate when
 the wind's up.""


 Heemskerk pushed his short-billed
 cap back on his close-cropped
 head, leaned back in his chair
 and folded his hands over his
 comfortable stomach.


 ""Then the passenger will have
 to wait for the next ship,"" he
 pronounced. ""The
Vanderdecken
has to blast off in thirty hours to
 catch Earth at the right orbital
 spot, and the G-boat has to blast
 off in ten hours to catch the
Vanderdecken
.""


 ""This passenger can't wait,""
 said Dekker. ""He needs to be
 evacuated to Earth immediately.
 He's suffering from the Venus
 Shadow.""


 Jan whistled softly. He had
 seen the effects of that disease.
 Dekker was right.


 ""Jan, you're the best driver in
 Oostpoort,"" said Dekker. ""You
 will have to take a groundcar to
 Rathole and bring the fellow
 back.""
So now Jan gripped his clay
 pipe between his teeth and piloted
 the groundcar into the teeth
 of the Twilight Gale.


 Den Hoorn was a comparatively
 flat desert sweep that ran
 along the western side of the
 Oost Mountains, just over the
 mountain from Oostpoort. It was
 a thin fault area of a planet
 whose crust was peculiarly subject
 to earthquakes, particularly
 at the beginning and end of each
 long day when temperatures of
 the surface rocks changed. On
 the other side of it lay Rathole, a
 little settlement that eked a precarious
 living from the Venerian
 vegetation. Jan never had seen it.


 He had little difficulty driving
 up and over the mountain, for the
 Dutch settlers had carved a
 rough road through the ravines.
 But even the 2½-meter wheels of
 the groundcar had trouble amid
 the tumbled rocks of Den Hoorn.
 The wind hit the car in full
 strength here and, though the
 body of the groundcar was suspended
 from the axles, there was
 constant danger of its being flipped
 over by a gust if not handled
 just right.


 The three earthshocks that had
 shaken Den Hoorn since he had
 been driving made his task no
 easier, but he was obviously
 lucky, at that. Often he had to
 detour far from his course to
 skirt long, deep cracks in the
 surface, or steep breaks where
 the crust had been raised or
 dropped several meters by past
 quakes.


 The groundcar zig-zagged
 slowly westward. The tattered
 violet-and-indigo clouds boiled
 low above it, but the wind was as
 dry as the breath of an oven.
 Despite the heavy cloud cover,
 the afternoon was as bright as
 an Earth-day. The thermometer
 showed the outside temperature
 to have dropped to 40 degrees
 Centigrade in the west wind, and
 it was still going down.


 Jan reached the edge of a
 crack that made further progress
 seem impossible. A hundred
 meters wide, of unknown depth,
 it stretched out of sight in both
 directions. For the first time he
 entertained serious doubts that
 Den Hoorn could be crossed by
 land.


 After a moment's hesitation,
 he swung the groundcar northward
 and raced along the edge of
 the chasm as fast as the car
 would negotiate the terrain. He
 looked anxiously at his watch.
 Nearly three hours had passed
 since he left Oostpoort. He had
 seven hours to go and he was
 still at least 16 kilometers from
 Rathole. His pipe was out, but
 he could not take his hands
 from the wheel to refill it.


 He had driven at least eight
 kilometers before he realized
 that the crack was narrowing.
 At least as far again, the two
 edges came together, but not at
 the same level. A sheer cliff
 three meters high now barred
 his passage. He drove on.
Apparently it was the result
 of an old quake. He found a spot
 where rocks had tumbled down,
 making a steep, rough ramp up
 the break. He drove up it and
 turned back southwestward.


 He made it just in time. He
 had driven less than three hundred
 meters when a quake more
 severe than any of the others
 struck. Suddenly behind him the
 break reversed itself, so that
 where he had climbed up coming
 westward he would now
 have to climb a cliff of equal
 height returning eastward.


 The ground heaved and buckled
 like a tempestuous sea.
 Rocks rolled and leaped through
 the air, several large ones striking
 the groundcar with ominous
 force. The car staggered forward
 on its giant wheels like a
 drunken man. The quake was so
 violent that at one time the vehicle
 was hurled several meters
 sideways, and almost overturned.
 And the wind smashed down
 on it unrelentingly.


 The quake lasted for several
 minutes, during which Jan was
 able to make no progress at all
 and struggled only to keep the
 groundcar upright. Then, in unison,
 both earthquake and wind
 died to absolute quiescence.


 Jan made use of this calm to
 step down on the accelerator and
 send the groundcar speeding
 forward. The terrain was easier
 here, nearing the western edge
 of Den Hoorn, and he covered
 several kilometers before the
 wind struck again, cutting his
 speed down considerably. He
 judged he must be nearing Rathole.


 Not long thereafter, he rounded
 an outcropping of rock and it
 lay before him.


 A wave of nostalgia swept
 over him. Back at Oostpoort, the
 power was nuclear, but this little
 settlement made use of the
 cheapest, most obviously available
 power source. It was dotted
 with more than a dozen windmills.


 Windmills! Tears came to
 Jan's eyes. For a moment, he
 was carried back to the flat
 lands around 's Gravenhage. For
 a moment he was a tow-headed,
 round-eyed boy again, clumping
 in wooden shoes along the edge
 of the tulip fields.


 But there were no canals here.
 The flat land, stretching into the
 darkening west, was spotted
 with patches of cactus and
 leather-leaved Venerian plants.
 Amid the windmills, low domes
 protruded from the earth, indicating
 that the dwellings of Rathole
 were, appropriately, partly
 underground.
He drove into the place. There
 were no streets, as such, but
 there were avenues between lines
 of heavy chains strung to short
 iron posts, evidently as handholds
 against the wind. The savage
 gale piled dust and sand in
 drifts against the domes, then,
 shifting slightly, swept them
 clean again.


 There was no one moving
 abroad, but just inside the community
 Jan found half a dozen
 men in a group, clinging to one
 of the chains and waving to him.
 He pulled the groundcar to a
 stop beside them, stuck his pipe
 in a pocket of his plastic venusuit,
 donned his helmet and
 got out.


 The wind almost took him
 away before one of them grabbed
 him and he was able to
 grasp the chain himself. They
 gathered around him. They were
 swarthy, black-eyed men, with
 curly hair. One of them grasped
 his hand.


 ""
Bienvenido, señor
,"" said the
 man.


 Jan recoiled and dropped the
 man's hand. All the Orangeman
 blood he claimed protested in
 outrage.


 Spaniards! All these men were
 Spaniards!
Jan recovered himself at once.
 He had been reading too much
 ancient history during his leisure
 hours. The hot monotony of
 Venus was beginning to affect
 his brain. It had been 500 years
 since the Netherlands revolted
 against Spanish rule. A lot of
 water over the dam since then.


 A look at the men around him,
 the sound of their chatter, convinced
 him that he need not try
 German or Hollandsch here. He
 fell back on the international
 language.


 ""Do you speak English?"" he
 asked. The man brightened but
 shook his head.


 ""
No hablo inglés
,"" he said,
 ""
pero el médico lo habla. Venga
 conmigo.
""


 He gestured for Jan to follow
 him and started off, pulling his
 way against the wind along the
 chain. Jan followed, and the
 other men fell in behind in single
 file. A hundred meters farther
 on, they turned, descended
 some steps and entered one of
 the half-buried domes. A gray-haired,
 bearded man was in the
 well-lighted room, apparently
 the living room of a home, with
 a young woman.


 ""
Él médico
,"" said the man who
 had greeted Jan, gesturing. ""
Él
 habla inglés.
""


 He went out, shutting the airlock
 door behind him.


 ""You must be the man from
 Oostpoort,"" said the bearded
 man, holding out his hand. ""I
 am Doctor Sanchez. We are very
 grateful you have come.""


 ""I thought for a while I
 wouldn't make it,"" said Jan ruefully,
 removing his venushelmet.


 ""This is Mrs. Murillo,"" said
 Sanchez.


 The woman was a Spanish
 blonde, full-lipped and beautiful,
 with golden hair and dark, liquid
 eyes. She smiled at Jan.


 ""
Encantada de conocerlo,
 señor
,"" she greeted him.


 ""Is this the patient, Doctor?""
 asked Jan, astonished. She looked
 in the best of health.


 ""No, the patient is in the next
 room,"" answered Sanchez.


 ""Well, as much as I'd like to
 stop for a pipe, we'd better start
 at once,"" said Jan. ""It's a hard
 drive back, and blastoff can't be
 delayed.""


 The woman seemed to sense
 his meaning. She turned and
 called: ""
Diego!
""


 A boy appeared in the door, a
 dark-skinned, sleepy-eyed boy of
 about eight. He yawned. Then,
 catching sight of the big Dutchman,
 he opened his eyes wide
 and smiled.


 The boy was healthy-looking,
 alert, but the mark of the Venus
 Shadow was on his face. There
 was a faint mottling, a criss-cross
 of dead-white lines.


 Mrs. Murillo spoke to him rapidly
 in Spanish and he nodded.
 She zipped him into a venusuit
 and fitted a small helmet on his
 head.


 ""Good luck,
amigo
,"" said Sanchez,
 shaking Jan's hand again.


 ""Thanks,"" replied Jan. He donned
 his own helmet. ""I'll need it,
 if the trip over was any indication.""
Jan and Diego made their way
 back down the chain to the
 groundcar. There was a score of
 men there now, and a few
 women. They let the pair go
 through, and waved farewell as
 Jan swung the groundcar around
 and headed back eastward.


 It was easier driving with the
 wind behind him, and Jan hit a
 hundred kilometers an hour several
 times before striking the
 rougher ground of Den Hoorn.
 Now, if he could only find a way
 over the bluff raised by that last
 quake....


 The ground of Den Hoorn was
 still shivering. Jan did not realize
 this until he had to brake the
 groundcar almost to a stop at one
 point, because it was not shaking
 in severe, periodic shocks as it
 had earlier. It quivered constantly,
 like the surface of quicksand.


 The ground far ahead of him
 had a strange color to it. Jan,
 watching for the cliff he had to
 skirt and scale, had picked up
 speed over some fairly even terrain,
 but now he slowed again,
 puzzled. There was something
 wrong ahead. He couldn't quite
 figure it out.


 Diego, beside him, had sat
 quietly so far, peering eagerly
 through the windshield, not saying
 a word. Now suddenly he
 cried in a high thin tenor:


 ""
Cuidado! Cuidado! Un abismo!
""


 Jim saw it at the same time
 and hit the brakes so hard the
 groundcar would have stood on
 its nose had its wheels been
 smaller. They skidded to a stop.


 The chasm that had caused
 him such a long detour before
 had widened, evidently in the big
 quake that had hit earlier. Now
 it was a canyon, half a kilometer
 wide. Five meters from the edge
 he looked out over blank space
 at the far wall, and could not see
 the bottom.


 Cursing choice Dutch profanity,
 Jan wheeled the groundcar
 northward and drove along the
 edge of the abyss as fast as he
 could. He wasted half an hour before
 realizing that it was getting
 no narrower.


 There was no point in going
 back southward. It might be a
 hundred kilometers long or a
 thousand, but he never could
 reach the end of it and thread
 the tumbled rocks of Den Hoorn
 to Oostpoort before the G-boat
 blastoff.


 There was nothing to do but
 turn back to Rathole and see if
 some other way could not be
 found.
Jan sat in the half-buried room
 and enjoyed the luxury of a pipe
 filled with some of Theodorus
 Neimeijer's mild tobacco. Before
 him, Dr. Sanchez sat with crossed
 legs, cleaning his fingernails
 with a scalpel. Diego's mother
 talked to the boy in low, liquid
 tones in a corner of the room.
Jan was at a loss to know how
 people whose technical knowledge
 was as skimpy as it obviously
 was in Rathole were able to build
 these semi-underground domes to
 resist the earth shocks that came
 from Den Hoorn. But this one
 showed no signs of stress. A religious
 print and a small pencil
 sketch of Señora Murillo, probably
 done by the boy, were awry
 on the inward-curving walls, but
 that was all.


 Jan felt justifiably exasperated
 at these Spanish-speaking people.


 ""If some effort had been made
 to take the boy to Oostpoort from
 here, instead of calling on us to
 send a car, Den Hoorn could have
 been crossed before the crack
 opened,"" he pointed out.


 ""An effort was made,"" replied
 Sanchez quietly. ""Perhaps you do
 not fully realize our position
 here. We have no engines except
 the stationary generators that
 give us current for our air-conditioning
 and our utilities. They
 are powered by the windmills. We
 do not have gasoline engines for
 vehicles, so our vehicles are operated
 by hand.""


 ""You push them?"" demanded
 Jan incredulously.


 ""No. You've seen pictures of
 the pump-cars that once were
 used on terrestrial railroads?
 Ours are powered like that, but
 we cannot operate them when the
 Venerian wind is blowing. By the
 time I diagnosed the Venus Shadow
 in Diego, the wind was coming
 up, and we had no way to get
 him to Oostpoort.""


 ""Mmm,"" grunted Jan. He
 shifted uncomfortably and looked
 at the pair in the corner. The
 blonde head was bent over the
 boy protectingly, and over his
 mother's shoulder Diego's black
 eyes returned Jan's glance.


 ""If the disease has just started,
 the boy could wait for the
 next Earth ship, couldn't he?""
 asked Jan.


 ""I said I had just diagnosed it,
 not that it had just started,
señor
,"" corrected Sanchez. ""As
 you know, the trip to Earth takes
 145 days and it can be started
 only when the two planets are at
 the right position in their orbits.
 Have you ever seen anyone die
 of the Venus Shadow?""


 ""Yes, I have,"" replied Jan in a
 low voice. He had seen two people
 die of it, and it had not been
 pleasant.


 Medical men thought it was a
 deficiency disease, but they had
 not traced down the deficiency responsible.
 Treatment by vitamins,
 diet, antibiotics, infrared
 and ultraviolet rays, all were useless.
 The only thing that could
 arrest and cure the disease was
 removal from the dry, cloud-hung
 surface of Venus and return to a
 moist, sunny climate on Earth.


 Without that treatment, once
 the typical mottled texture of the
 skin appeared, the flesh rapidly
 deteriorated and fell away in
 chunks. The victim remained unfevered
 and agonizingly conscious
 until the degeneration
 reached a vital spot.


 ""If you have,"" said Sanchez,
 ""you must realize that Diego cannot
 wait for a later ship, if his
 life is to be saved. He must get
 to Earth at once.""
Jan puffed at the Heerenbaai-Tabak
 and cogitated. The place
 was aptly named. It was a ratty
 community. The boy was a dark-skinned
 little Spaniard—of Mexican
 origin, perhaps. But he was
 a boy, and a human being.


 A thought occurred to him.
 From what he had seen and
 heard, the entire economy of Rathole
 could not support the tremendous
 expense of sending the
 boy across the millions of miles
 to Earth by spaceship.


 ""Who's paying his passage?""
 he asked. ""The Dutch Central
 Venus Company isn't exactly a
 charitable institution.""


 ""Your
Señor
Dekker said that
 would be taken care of,"" replied
 Sanchez.


 Jan relit his pipe silently, making
 a mental resolution that Dekker
 wouldn't take care of it alone.
 Salaries for Venerian service
 were high, and many of the men
 at Oostpoort would contribute
 readily to such a cause.


 ""Who is Diego's father?"" he
 asked.


 ""He was Ramón Murillo, a very
 good mechanic,"" answered Sanchez,
 with a sliding sidelong
 glance at Jan's face. ""He has
 been dead for three years.""


 Jan grunted.


 ""The copters at Oostpoort can't
 buck this wind,"" he said thoughtfully,
 ""or I'd have come in one of
 those in the first place instead of
 trying to cross Den Hoorn by
 land. But if you have any sort of
 aircraft here, it might make it
 downwind—if it isn't wrecked on
 takeoff.""


 ""I'm afraid not,"" said Sanchez.


 ""Too bad. There's nothing we
 can do, then. The nearest settlement
 west of here is more than
 a thousand kilometers away, and
 I happen to know they have no
 planes, either. Just copters. So
 that's no help.""


 ""Wait,"" said Sanchez, lifting
 the scalpel and tilting his head.
 ""I believe there is something,
 though we cannot use it. This
 was once an American naval base,
 and the people here were civilian
 employes who refused to move
 north with it. There was a flying
 machine they used for short-range
 work, and one was left behind—probably
 with a little help
 from the people of the settlement.
 But....""


 ""What kind of machine? Copter
 or plane?""


 ""They call it a flying platform.
 It carries two men, I believe.
 But,
señor
....""


 ""I know them. I've operated
 them, before I left Earth. Man,
 you don't expect me to try to fly
 one of those little things in this
 wind? They're tricky as they can
 be, and the passengers are absolutely
 unprotected!""


 ""
Señor
, I have asked you to do
 nothing.""


 ""No, you haven't,"" muttered
 Jan. ""But you know I'll do it.""


 Sanchez looked into his face,
 smiling faintly and a little sadly.


 ""I was sure you would be willing,""
 he said. He turned and
 spoke in Spanish to Mrs. Murillo.


 The woman rose to her feet
 and came to them. As Jan arose,
 she looked up at him, tears in
 her eyes.


 ""
Gracias
,"" she murmured. ""
Un
 millón de gracias.
""


 She lifted his hands in hers
 and kissed them.


 Jan disengaged himself gently,
 embarrassed. But it occurred to
 him, looking down on the bowed
 head of the beautiful young
 widow, that he might make some
 flying trips back over here in his
 leisure time. Language barriers
 were not impassable, and feminine
 companionship might cure
 his neurotic, history-born distaste
 for Spaniards, for more
 than one reason.


 Sanchez was tugging at his
 elbow.


 ""
Señor
, I have been trying to
 tell you,"" he said. ""It is generous
 and good of you, and I wanted
Señora
Murillo to know what a
 brave man you are. But have you
 forgotten that we have no gasoline
 engines here? There is no
 fuel for the flying platform.""
The platform was in a warehouse
 which, like the rest of the
 structures in Rathole, was a
 half-buried dome. The platform's
 ring-shaped base was less than a
 meter thick, standing on four
 metal legs. On top of it, in the
 center, was a railed circle that
 would hold two men, but would
 crowd them. Two small gasoline
 engines sat on each side of this
 railed circle and between them on
 a third side was the fuel tank.
 The passengers entered it on the
 fourth side.


 The machine was dusty and
 spotted with rust, Jan, surrounded
 by Sanchez, Diego and a dozen
 men, inspected it thoughtfully.
 The letters USN*SES were
 painted in white on the platform
 itself, and each engine bore the
 label ""Hiller.""


 Jan peered over the edge of the
 platform at the twin-ducted fans
 in their plastic shrouds. They
 appeared in good shape. Each
 was powered by one of the engines,
 transmitted to it by heavy
 rubber belts.


 Jan sighed. It was an unhappy
 situation. As far as he could determine,
 without making tests,
 the engines were in perfect condition.
 Two perfectly good engines,
 and no fuel for them.


 ""You're sure there's no gasoline,
 anywhere in Rathole?"" he
 asked Sanchez.


 Sanchez smiled ruefully, as he
 had once before, at Jan's appellation
 for the community. The inhabitants'
 term for it was simply
 ""
La Ciudad Nuestra
""—""Our
 Town."" But he made no protest.
 He turned to one of the other
 men and talked rapidly for a few
 moments in Spanish.


 ""None,
señor
,"" he said, turning
 back to Jan. ""The Americans, of
 course, kept much of it when
 they were here, but the few
 things we take to Oostpoort to
 trade could not buy precious gasoline.
 We have electricity in
 plenty if you can power the platform
 with it.""


 Jan thought that over, trying
 to find a way.


 ""No, it wouldn't work,"" he
 said. ""We could rig batteries on
 the platform and electric motors
 to turn the propellers. But batteries
 big enough to power it all
 the way to Oostpoort would be
 so heavy the machine couldn't lift
 them off the ground. If there
 were some way to carry a power
 line all the way to Oostpoort, or
 to broadcast the power to it....
 But it's a light-load machine,
 and must have an engine that
 gives it the necessary power from
 very little weight.""


 Wild schemes ran through his
 head. If they were on water, instead
 of land, he could rig up a
 sail. He could still rig up a sail,
 for a groundcar, except for the
 chasm out on Den Hoorn.


 The groundcar! Jan straightened
 and snapped his fingers.


 ""Doctor!"" he explained. ""Send
 a couple of men to drain the rest
 of the fuel from my groundcar.
 And let's get this platform above
 ground and tie it down until we
 can get it started.""


 Sanchez gave rapid orders in
 Spanish. Two of the men left at a
 run, carrying five-gallon cans
 with them.


 Three others picked up the
 platform and carried it up a ramp
 and outside. As soon as they
 reached ground level, the wind
 hit them. They dropped the platform
 to the ground, where it
 shuddered and swayed momentarily,
 and two of the men fell
 successfully on their stomachs.
 The wind caught the third and
 somersaulted him half a dozen
 times before he skidded to a stop
 on his back with outstretched
 arms and legs. He turned over
 cautiously and crawled back to
 them.


 Jan, his head just above
 ground level, surveyed the terrain.
 There was flat ground to
 the east, clear in a fairly broad
 alley for at least half a kilometer
 before any of the domes protruded
 up into it.


 ""This is as good a spot for
 takeoff as we'll find,"" he said to
 Sanchez.


 The men put three heavy ropes
 on the platform's windward rail
 and secured it by them to the
 heavy chain that ran by the
 dome. The platform quivered and
 shuddered in the heavy wind, but
 its base was too low for it to
 overturn.


 Shortly the two men returned
 with the fuel from the groundcar,
 struggling along the chain.
 Jan got above ground in a
 crouch, clinging to the rail of the
 platform, and helped them fill
 the fuel tank with it. He primed
 the carburetors and spun the
 engines.


 Nothing happened.
He turned the engines over
 again. One of them coughed, and
 a cloud of blue smoke burst from
 its exhaust, but they did not
 catch.


 ""What is the matter,
señor
?""
 asked Sanchez from the dome entrance.


 ""I don't know,"" replied Jan.
 ""Maybe it's that the engines
 haven't been used in so long. I'm
 afraid I'm not a good enough
 mechanic to tell.""


 ""Some of these men were good
 mechanics when the navy was
 here,"" said Sanchez. ""Wait.""


 He turned and spoke to someone
 in the dome. One of the men
 of Rathole came to Jan's side and
 tried the engines. They refused
 to catch. The man made carburetor
 adjustments and tried
 again. No success.


 He sniffed, took the cap from
 the fuel tank and stuck a finger
 inside. He withdrew it, wet and
 oily, and examined it. He turned
 and spoke to Sanchez.


 ""He says that your groundcar
 must have a diesel engine,"" Sanchez
 interpreted to Jan. ""Is that
 correct?""


 ""Why, yes, that's true.""


 ""He says the fuel will not work
 then,
señor
. He says it is low-grade
 fuel and the platform must
 have high octane gasoline.""


 Jan threw up his hands and
 went back into the dome.


 ""I should have known that,"" he
 said unhappily. ""I would have
 known if I had thought of it.""


 ""What is to be done, then?""
 asked Sanchez.


 ""There's nothing that can be
 done,"" answered Jan. ""They may
 as well put the fuel back in my
 groundcar.""


 Sanchez called orders to the
 men at the platform. While they
 worked, Jan stared out at the
 furiously spinning windmills that
 dotted Rathole.


 ""There's nothing that can be
 done,"" he repeated. ""We can't
 make the trip overland because
 of the chasm out there in Den
 Hoorn, and we can't fly the platform
 because we have no power
 for it.""


 Windmills. Again Jan could
 imagine the flat land around
 them as his native Holland, with
 the Zuider Zee sparkling to the
 west where here the desert
 stretched under darkling clouds.
Jan looked at his watch. A
 little more than two hours before
 the G-boat's blastoff time, and it
 couldn't wait for them. It was
 nearly eight hours since he had
 left Oostpoort, and the afternoon
 was getting noticeably
 darker.


 Jan was sorry. He had done his
 best, but Venus had beaten him.


 He looked around for Diego.
 The boy was not in the dome. He
 was outside, crouched in the lee
 of the dome, playing with some
 sticks.


 Diego must know of his ailment,
 and why he had to go to
 Oostpoort. If Jan was any judge
 of character, Sanchez would have
 told him that. Whether Diego
 knew it was a life-or-death matter
 for him to be aboard the
Vanderdecken
when it blasted
 off for Earth, Jan did not know.
 But the boy was around eight
 years old and he was bright, and
 he must realize the seriousness
 involved in a decision to send him
 all the way to Earth.


 Jan felt ashamed of the exuberant
 foolishness which had
 led him to spout ancient history
 and claim descent from William
 of Orange. It had been a hobby,
 and artificial topic for conversation
 that amused him and his
 companions, a defense against
 the monotony of Venus that had
 begun to affect his personality
 perhaps a bit more than he realized.
 He did not dislike Spaniards;
 he had no reason to dislike
 them. They were all humans—the
 Spanish, the Dutch, the Germans,
 the Americans, even the
 Russians—fighting a hostile
 planet together. He could not understand
 a word Diego said when
 the boy spoke to him, but he
 liked Diego and wished desperately
 he could do something.


 Outside, the windmills of Rathole
 spun merrily.


 There was power, the power
 that lighted and air-conditioned
 Rathole, power in the air all
 around them. If he could only use
 it! But to turn the platform on
 its side and let the wind spin the
 propellers was pointless.


 He turned to Sanchez.


 ""Ask the men if there are any
 spare parts for the platform,"" he
 said. ""Some of those legs it
 stands on, transmission belts,
 spare propellers.""


 Sanchez asked.


 ""Yes,"" he said. ""Many spare
 parts, but no fuel.""


 Jan smiled a tight smile.


 ""Tell them to take the engines
 out,"" he said. ""Since we have no
 fuel, we may as well have no
 engines.""
Pieter Heemskerk stood by the
 ramp to the stubby G-boat and
 checked his watch. It was X
 minus fifteen—fifteen minutes
 before blastoff time.


 Heemskerk wore a spacesuit.
 Everything was ready, except
 climbing aboard, closing the airlock
 and pressing the firing pin.


 What on Venus could have happened
 to Van Artevelde? The last
 radio message they had received,
 more than an hour ago, had said
 he and the patient took off successfully
 in an aircraft. What
 sort of aircraft could he be flying
 that would require an hour to
 cover eighty kilometers, with the
 wind?


 Heemskerk could only draw the
 conclusion that the aircraft had
 been wrecked somewhere in Den
 Hoorn. As a matter of fact, he
 knew that preparations were being
 made now to send a couple of
 groundcars out to search for it.


 This, of course, would be too
 late to help the patient Van Artevelde
 was bringing, but Heemskerk
 had no personal interest in
 the patient. His worry was all for
 his friend. The two of them had
 enjoyed chess and good beer together
 on his last three trips to
 Venus, and Heemskerk hoped
 very sincerely that the big blond
 man wasn't hurt.


 He glanced at his watch again.
 X minus twelve. In two minutes,
 it would be time for him to walk
 up the ramp into the G-boat. In
 seven minutes the backward
 count before blastoff would start
 over the area loudspeakers.


 Heemskerk shook his head sadly.
 And Van Artevelde had promised
 to come back triumphant,
 with a broom at his masthead!


 It was a high thin whine borne
 on the wind, carrying even
 through the walls of his spacehelmet,
 that attracted Heemskerk's
 attention and caused him
 to pause with his foot on the
 ramp. Around him, the rocket
 mechanics were staring up at the
 sky, trying to pinpoint the noise.


 Heemskerk looked westward.
 At first he could see nothing,
 then there was a moving dot
 above the mountain, against the
 indigo umbrella of clouds. It
 grew, it swooped, it approached
 and became a strange little flying
 disc with two people standing on
 it and
something
sticking up
 from its deck in front of them.


 A broom?


 No. The platform hovered and
 began to settle nearby, and there
 was Van Artevelde leaning over
 its rail and fiddling frantically
 with whatever it was that stuck
 up on it—a weird, angled contraption
 of pipes and belts topped
 by a whirring blade. A boy stood
 at his shoulder and tried to help
 him. As the platform descended
 to a few meters above ground,
 the Dutchman slashed at the contraption,
 the cut ends of belts
 whipped out wildly and the platform
 slid to the ground with a
 rush. It hit with a clatter and its
 two passengers tumbled prone to
 the ground.


 ""Jan!"" boomed Heemskerk,
 forcing his voice through the helmet
 diaphragm and rushing over
 to his friend. ""I was afraid you
 were lost!""


 Jan struggled to his feet and
 leaned down to help the boy up.


 ""Here's your patient, Pieter,""
 he said. ""Hope you have a spacesuit
 in his size.""


 ""I can find one. And we'll have
 to hurry for blastoff. But, first,
 what happened? Even that
 damned thing ought to get here
 from Rathole faster than that.""


 ""Had no fuel,"" replied Jan
 briefly. ""My engines were all
 right, but I had no power to run
 them. So I had to pull the engines
 and rig up a power source.""


 Heemskerk stared at the platform.
 On its railing was rigged a
 tripod of battered metal pipes,
 atop which a big four-blade propeller
 spun slowly in what wind
 was left after it came over the
 western mountain. Over the
 edges of the platform, running
 from the two propellers in its
 base, hung a series of tattered
 transmission belts.


 ""Power source?"" repeated
 Heemskerk. ""That?""


 ""Certainly,"" replied Jan with
 dignity. ""The power source any
 good Dutchman turns to in an
 emergency: a windmill!""

It was alien but was it dead, this towering, sinister

 city of metal that glittered malignantly before the

 cautious advance of three awed space-scouters.


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Planet Stories Summer 1955.

Martin set the lifeboat down carefully, with all the attention one
 usually exercises in a situation where the totally unexpected has
 occurred, and he and his two companions sat and stared in awed silence
 at the city a quarter-mile away.


 He saw the dull, black walls of buildings shouldering grimly into the
 twilight sky, saw the sheared edge where the metal city ended and the
 barren earth began ... and he remembered observing, even before they
 landed, the too-strict geometry imposed on the entire construction.


 He frowned. The first impression was ... malignant.


 Wass, blond and slight, with enough nose for three or four men,
 unbuckled his safety belt and stood up. ""Shall we, gentlemen?"" and with
 a graceful movement of hand and arm he indicated the waiting city.


 Martin led Wass, and the gangling, scarecrow-like Rodney, through the
 stillness overlaying the barren ground. There was only the twilight
 sky, and harsh and black against it, the convoluted earth. And the
 city. Malignant. He wondered, again, what beings would choose to build
 a city—even a city like this one—in such surroundings.


 The men from the ship knew only the surface facts about this waiting
 geometric discovery. Theirs was the eleventh inter-planetary flight,
 and the previous ten, in the time allowed them for exploration while
 this planet was still close enough to their own to permit a safe return
 in their ships, had not spotted the city. But the eleventh expedition
 had, an hour ago, with just thirteen hours left during which a return
 flight could be safely started. So far as was known, this was the only
 city on the planet—the planet without any life at all, save tiny
 mosses, for a million years or more. And no matter which direction from
 the city a man moved, he would always be going north.


 ""Hey, Martin!"" Rodney called through his helmet radio. Martin paused.
 ""Wind,"" Rodney said, coming abreast of him. He glanced toward the black
 pile, as if sharing Martin's thoughts. ""That's all we need, isn't it?""


 Martin looked at the semi-transparent figures of wind and dust
 cavorting in the distance, moving toward them. He grinned a little,
 adjusting his radio. ""Worried?""


 Rodney's bony face was without expression. ""Gives me the creeps, kind
 of. I wonder what they were like?""


 Wass murmured, ""Let us hope they aren't immortal.""


 Three feet from the edge of the city Martin stopped and stubbed at the
 sand with the toe of his boot, clearing earth from part of a shining
 metal band.


 Wass watched him, and then shoved aside more sand, several feet away.
 ""It's here, too.""


 Martin stood up. ""Let's try farther on. Rodney, radio the ship, tell
 them we're going in.""


 Rodney nodded.


 After a time, Wass said, ""Here, too. How far do you think it goes?""


 Martin shrugged. ""Clear around the city? I'd like to know what it
 is—was—for.""


 ""Defense,"" Rodney, several yards behind, suggested.


 ""Could be,"" Martin said. ""Let's go in.""


 The three crossed the metal band and walked abreast down a street,
 their broad soft soled boots making no sound on the dull metal. They
 passed doors and arches and windows and separate buildings. They moved
 cautiously across five intersections. And they stood in a square
 surrounded by the tallest buildings in the city.


 Rodney broke the silence, hesitantly. ""Not—not very big. Is it?""


 Wass looked at him shrewdly. ""Neither were the—well, shall we call
 them, people? Have you noticed how low everything is?""


 Rodney's laughter rose, too. Then, sobering—""Maybe they crawled.""


 A nebulous image, product of childhood's vivid imagination, moved
 slowly across Martin's mind. ""All right!"" he rapped out—and the image
 faded.


 ""Sorry,"" Rodney murmured, his throat working beneath his lantern jaw.
 Then—""I wonder what it's like here in the winter when there's no light
 at all?""


 ""I imagine they had illumination of some sort,"" Martin answered, dryly.
 ""If we don't hurry up and get through this place and back to the ship,
 we're very likely to find out.""


 Rodney said quickly, ""I mean outside.""


 ""Out there, too, Rodney, they must have had illumination."" Martin
 looked back along the straight, metal street they'd walked on, and past
 that out over the bleak, furrowed slopes where the ship's lifeboat
 lay ... and he thought everything outside the city seemed, somehow,
 from here, a little dim, a little hazy.


 He straightened his shoulders. The city was alien, of course, and that
 explained most of it ... most of it. But he felt the black city was
 something familiar, yet twisted and distorted.


 ""Well,"" Wass said, his nose wrinkling a bit, ""now that we're here....""


 ""Pictures,"" Martin decided. ""We have twelve hours. We'll start here.
 What's the matter, Wass?""


 The blond man grinned ruefully. ""I left the camera in the lifeboat.""
 There was a pause. Then Wass, defensively—""It's almost as if the city
 didn't want to be photographed.""


 Martin ignored the remark. ""Go get it. Rodney and I will be somewhere
 along this street.""


 Wass turned away. Martin and Rodney started slowly down the wide metal
 street, at right angles to their path of entrance.


 Again Martin felt a tug of twisted, distorted familiarity. It was
 almost as if ... they were human up to a certain point, the point
 being, perhaps, some part of their minds.... Alien things, dark and
 subtle, things no man could ever comprehend.


 Parallel evolution on two inner planets of the same system? Somewhere,
 sometime, a common ancestor? Martin noted the shoulder-high doors, the
 heavier gravity, remembered the inhabitants of the city vanished before
 the thing that was to become man ever emerged from the slime, and he
 decided to grin at himself, at his own imagination.


 Rodney jerked his scarecrow length about quickly, and a chill sped up
 Martin's spine. ""What's the matter?""


 The bony face was white, the gray eyes were wide. ""I saw—I thought I
 saw—something—moving—""


 Anger rose in Martin. ""You didn't,"" he said flatly, gripping the
 other's shoulder cruelly. ""You couldn't have. Get hold of yourself,
 man!""


 Rodney stared. ""The wind. Remember? There isn't any, here.""


 ""... How could there be? The buildings protect us now. It was blowing
 from the other direction.""


 Rodney wrenched free of Martin's grip. He gestured wildly. ""That—""


 ""Martin!"" Wass' voice came through the receivers in both their radios.
 ""Martin, I can't get out!""
Rodney mumbled something, and Martin told him to shut up.


 Wass said, more quietly, ""Remember that metal band? It's all clear now,
 and glittering, as far as I can see. I can't get across it; it's like a
 glass wall.""


 ""We're trapped, we're trapped, they are—""


 ""Shut up, Rodney! Wass, I'm only two sections from the edge. I'll check
 here.""


 Martin clapped a hand on Rodney's shoulder again, starting him moving,
 toward the city's edge, past the black, silent buildings.


 The glittering band was here, too, like a halo around a silhouette.


 ""No go,"" Martin said to Wass. He bit at his lower lip. ""I think it must
 be all around us."" He was silent for a time, exploring the consequences
 of this. Then—""We'll meet you in the middle of the city, where we
 separated.""


 Walking with Rodney, Martin heard Wass' voice, flat and metallic
 through the radio receiver against his ear. ""What do you suppose caused
 this?""


 He shook his head angrily, saying, ""Judging by reports of the rest of
 the planet, it must have been horribly radioactive at one time. All of
 it.""


 ""Man-made radiation, you mean.""


 Martin grinned faintly. Wass, too, had an active imagination. ""Well,
 alien-made, anyhow. Perhaps they had a war.""


 Wass' voice sounded startled. ""Anti-radiation screen?""


 Rodney interrupted, ""There hasn't been enough radiation around here for
 hundreds of thousands of years to activate such a screen.""


 Wass said coldly, ""He's right, Martin.""


 Martin crossed an intersection, Rodney slightly behind him. ""You're
 both wrong,"" he said. ""We landed here today.""


 Rodney stopped in the middle of the metal street and stared down at
 Martin. ""The wind—?""


 ""Why not?""


 ""That would explain why it stopped so suddenly, then."" Rodney stood
 straighter. When he walked again, his steps were firmer.


 They reached the center of the city, ahead of the small, slight Wass,
 and stood watching him labor along the metal toward them.


 Wass' face, Martin saw, was sober. ""I tried to call the ship. No luck.""


 ""The shield?""


 Wass nodded. ""What else?""


 ""I don't know—""


 ""If we went to the roof of the tallest building,"" Rodney offered, ""we
 might—""


 Martin shook his head. ""No. To be effective, the shield would have to
 cover the city.""


 Wass stared down at the metal street, as if he could look through it.
 ""I wonder where it gets its power?""


 ""Down below, probably. If there is a down below."" Martin hesitated. ""We
 may have to....""


 ""What?"" Rodney prompted.


 Martin shrugged. ""Let's look.""


 He led the way through a shoulder-high arch in one of the tall
 buildings surrounding the square. The corridor inside was dim and
 plain, and he switched on his flashlight, the other two immediately
 following his example. The walls and the rounded ceiling of the
 corridor were of the same dull metal as the buildings' facades, and
 the streets. There were a multitude of doors and arches set into
 either side of the corridor.


 It was rather like ... entering a gigantic metal beehive.


 Martin chose an arch, with beyond it a metal ramp, which tilted
 downward, gleaming in the pale circle of his torch.


 A call from Rodney halted him. ""Back here,"" the tall man repeated. ""It
 looks like a switchboard.""


 The three advanced to the end of the central corridor, pausing before a
 great arch, outlined in the too-careful geometrical figures Martin had
 come to associate with the city builders. The three torches, shining
 through the arch, picked out a bank of buttons, handles ... and a thick
 rope of cables which ran upward to vanish unexpectedly in the metal
 roof.


 ""Is this it,"" Wass murmured, ""or an auxiliary?""


 Martin shrugged. ""The whole city's no more than a machine, apparently.""


 ""Another assumption,"" Wass said. ""We have done nothing but make
 assumptions ever since we got here.""


 ""What would you suggest, instead?"" Martin asked calmly.


 Rodney furtively, extended one hand toward a switch.


 ""No!"" Martin said, sharply. That was one assumption they dared not make.


 Rodney turned. ""But—""


 ""No. Wass, how much time have we?""


 ""The ship leaves in eleven hours.""


 ""Eleven hours,"" Rodney repeated. ""Eleven hours!"" He reached out for the
 switch again. Martin swore, stepped forward, pulled him back roughly.


 He directed his flashlight at Rodney's thin, pale face. ""What do you
 think you're doing?""


 ""We have to find out what all this stuff's for!""


 ""Going at it blindly, we'd probably execute ourselves.""


 ""We've got to—""


 ""No!"" Then, more quietly—""We still have eleven hours to find a way
 out.""


 ""Ten hours and forty-five minutes,"" Wass disagreed softly. ""Minus the
 time it takes us to get to the lifeboat, fly to the ship, land, stow
 it, get ourselves aboard, and get the big ship away from the planet.
 And Captain Morgan can't wait for us, Martin.""


 ""You too, Wass?""


 ""Up to the point of accuracy, yes.""


 Martin said, ""Not necessarily. You go the way the wind does, always
 thinking of your own tender hide, of course.""


 Rodney cursed. ""And every second we stand here doing nothing gives us
 that much less time to find a way out. Martin—""


 ""Make one move toward that switchboard and I'll stop you where you
 stand!""
Wass moved silently through the darkness beyond the torches. ""We all
 have guns, Martin.""


 ""I'm holding mine."" Martin waited.


 After a moment, Wass switched his flashlight back on. He said quietly,
 ""He's right, Rodney. It would be sure death to monkey around in here.""


 ""Well...."" Rodney turned quickly toward the black arch. ""Let's get out
 of here, then!""


 Martin hung back waiting for the others to go ahead of him down the
 metal hall. At the other arch, where the ramp led downward, he called a
 halt. ""If the dome, or whatever it is, is a radiation screen there must
 be at least half-a-dozen emergency exits around the city.""


 Rodney said, ""To search every building next to the dome clean around
 the city would take years.""


 Martin nodded. ""But there must be central roads beneath this main level
 leading to them. Up here there are too many roads.""


 Wass laughed rudely.


 ""Have you a better idea?""


 Wass ignored that, as Martin hoped he would. He said slowly, ""That
 leads to another idea. If the band around the city is responsible for
 the dome, does it project down into the ground as well?""


 ""You mean
dig
out?"" Martin asked.


 ""Sure. Why not?""


 ""We're wearing heavy suits and bulky breathing units. We have no
 equipment.""


 ""That shouldn't be hard to come by.""


 Martin smiled, banishing Wass' idea.


 Rodney said, ""They may have had their digging equipment built right in
 to themselves.""


 ""Anyway,"" Martin decided, ""we can take a look down below.""


 ""In the pitch dark,"" Wass added.


 Martin adjusted his torch, began to lead the way down the metal ramp.
 The incline was gentle, apparently constructed for legs shorter, feet
 perhaps less broad than their own. The metal, without mark of any sort,
 gleamed under the combined light of the torches, unrolling out of the
 darkness before the men.


 At length the incline melted smoothly into the next level of the city.


 Martin shined his light upward, and the others followed his example.
 Metal as smooth and featureless as that on which they stood shone down
 on them.


 Wass turned his light parallel with the floor, and then moved slowly in
 a circle. ""No supports. No supports anywhere. What keeps all that up
 there?""


 ""I don't know. I have no idea."" Martin gestured toward the ramp with
 his light. ""Does all this, this whole place, look at all familiar to
 you?""


 Rodney's gulp was clearly audible through the radio receivers. ""Here?""


 ""No, no,"" Martin answered impatiently, ""not just here. I mean the whole
 city.""


 ""Yes,"" Wass said dryly, ""it does. I'm sure this is where all my
 nightmares stay when they're not on shift.""


 Martin turned on his heel and started down a metal avenue which, he
 thought, paralleled the street above. And Rodney and Wass followed him
 silently. They moved along the metal, past unfamiliar shapes made more
 so by gloom and moving shadows, past doors dancing grotesquely in the
 three lights, past openings in the occasional high metal partitions,
 past something which was perhaps a conveyor belt, past another
 something which could have been anything at all.


 The metal street ended eventually in a blank metal wall.


 The edge of the city—the city which was a dome of force above and a
 bowl of metal below.


 After a long time, Wass sighed. ""Well, skipper...?""


 ""We go back, I guess,"" Martin said.


 Rodney turned swiftly to face him. Martin thought the tall man was
 holding his gun. ""To the switchboard, Martin?""


 ""Unless someone has a better idea,"" Martin conceded. He waited. But
 Rodney was holding the gun ... and Wass was.... Then—""I can't think of
 anything else.""


 They began to retrace their steps along the metal street, back past
 the same dancing shapes of metal, the partitions, the odd windows, all
 looking different now in the new angles of illumination.


 Martin was in the lead. Wass followed him silently. Rodney, tall,
 matchstick thin, even in his cumbersome suit, swayed with jaunty
 triumph in the rear.


 Martin looked at the metal street lined with its metal objects and he
 sighed. He remembered how the dark buildings of the city looked at
 surface level, how the city itself looked when they were landing, and
 then when they were walking toward it. The dream was gone again for
 now. Idealism died in him, again and again, yet it was always reborn.
 But—The only city, so far as anyone knew, on the first planet they'd
 ever explored. And it had to be like this. Nightmares, Wass said, and
 Martin thought perhaps the city was built by a race of beings who at
 some point twisted away from their evolutionary spiral, plagued by a
 sort of racial insanity.


 No, Martin thought, shaking his head. No, that couldn't be.
 Viewpoint ... his viewpoint. It was the haunting sense of familiarity,
 a faint strain through all this broad jumble, the junkpile of alien
 metal, which was making him theorize so wildly.


 Then Wass touched his elbow. ""Look there, Martin. Left of the ramp.""


 Light from their torches was reflected, as from glass.


 ""All right,"" Rodney said belligerently into his radio. ""What's holding
 up the procession?""


 Martin was silent.


 Wass undertook to explain. Why not, after all? Martin asked himself. It
 was in Wass' own interest. In a moment, all three were standing before
 a bank of glass cases which stretched off into the distance as far as
 the combined light of their torches would reach.


 ""Seeds!"" Wass exclaimed, his faceplate pressed against the glass.


 Martin blinked. He thought how little time they had. He wet his lips.


 Wass' gloved hands fumbled awkwardly at a catch in the nearest section
 of the bank.


 Martin thought of the dark, convoluted land outside the city. If they
 wouldn't grow there.... Or had they, once? ""Don't, Wass!""


 Torchlight reflected from Wass' faceplate as he turned his head. ""Why
 not?""


 They were like children.... ""We don't know, released, what they'll do.""


 ""Skipper,"" Wass said carefully, ""if we don't get out of this place by
 the deadline we may be eating these.""


 Martin raised his arm tensely. ""Opening a seed bank doesn't help us
 find a way out of here."" He started up the ramp. ""Besides, we've no
 water.""


 Rodney came last up the ramp, less jaunty now, but still holding the
 gun. His mind, too, was taken up with childhood's imaginings. ""For
 a plant to grow in this environment, it wouldn't need much water.
 Maybe—"" he had a vision of evil plants attacking them, growing with
 super-swiftness at the air valves and joints of their suits ""—only the
 little moisture in the atmosphere.""
They stood before the switchboard again. Martin and Wass side by side,
 Rodney, still holding his gun, slightly to the rear.


 Rodney moved forward a little toward the switches. His breathing was
 loud and rather uneven in the radio receivers.


 Martin made a final effort. ""Rodney, it's still almost nine hours to
 take off. Let's search awhile first. Let this be a last resort.""


 Rodney jerked his head negatively. ""No. Now, I know you, Martin.
 Postpone and postpone until it's too late, and the ship leaves without
 us and we're stranded here to eat seeds and gradually dehydrate
 ourselves and God only knows what else and—""


 He reached out convulsively and yanked a switch.


 Martin leaped, knocking him to the floor. Rodney's gun skittered away
 silently, like a live thing, out of the range of the torches.


 The radio receivers impersonally recorded the grating sounds of
 Rodney's sobs.


 ""Sorry,"" Martin said, without feeling. He turned quickly. ""Wass?""


 The slight, blond man stood unmoving. ""I'm with you, Martin, but, as
 a last resort it might be better to be blown sky high than to die
 gradually—""


 Martin was watching Rodney, struggling to get up. ""I agree. As a last
 resort. We still have a little time.""


 Rodney's tall, spare figure looked bowed and tired in the torchlight,
 now that he was up again. ""Martin, I—""


 Martin turned his back. ""Skip it, Rodney,"" he said gently.


 ""Water,"" Wass said thoughtfully. ""There must be reservoirs under this
 city somewhere.""


 Rodney said, ""How does water help us get out?""


 Martin glanced at Wass, then started out of the switchboard room, not
 looking back. ""It got in and out of the city some way. Perhaps we can
 leave the same way.""


 Down the ramp again.


 ""There's another ramp,"" Wass murmured.


 Rodney looked down it. ""I wonder how many there are, all told.""


 Martin placed one foot on the metal incline. He angled his torch down,
 picking out shadowy, geometrical shapes, duplicates of the ones on the
 present level. ""We'll find out,"" he said, ""how many there are.""


 Eleven levels later Rodney asked, ""How much time have we now?""


 ""Seven hours,"" Wass said quietly, ""until take-off.""


 ""One more level,"" Martin said, ignoring the reference to time. ""I ...
 think it's the last.""


 They walked down the ramp and stood together, silent in a dim pool of
 artificial light on the bottom level of the alien city.


 Rodney played his torch about the metal figures carefully placed about
 the floor. ""Martin, what if there are no reservoirs? What if there are
 cemeteries instead? Or cold storage units? Maybe the switch I pulled—""


 ""Rodney! Stop it!""


 Rodney swallowed audibly. ""This place scares me....""


 ""The first time I was ever in a rocket, it scared me. I was thirteen.""


 ""This is different,"" Wass said. ""Built-in traps—""


 ""They had a war,"" Martin said.


 Wass agreed. ""And the survivors retired here. Why?""


 Martin said, ""They wanted to rebuild. Or maybe this was already built
 before the war as a retreat."" He turned impatiently. ""How should I
 know?""


 Wass turned, too, persistent. ""But the planet was through with them.""


 ""In a minute,"" Martin said, too irritably, ""we'll have a sentient
 planet."" From the corner of his eye he saw Rodney start at that. ""Knock
 it off, Wass. We're looking for reservoirs, you know.""


 They moved slowly down the metal avenue, between the twisted shadow
 shapes, looking carefully about them.


 Rodney paused. ""We might not recognize one.""


 Martin urged him on. ""You know what a man-hole cover looks like."" He
 added dryly, ""Use your imagination.""


 They reached the metal wall at the end of the avenue and paused again,
 uncertain.


 Martin swung his flashlight, illuminating the distorted metal shapes.


 Wass said, ""All this had a purpose, once....""


 ""We'll disperse and search carefully,"" Martin said.


 ""I wonder what the pattern was.""


 ""... The reservoirs, Wass. The pattern will still be here for later
 expeditions to study. So will we if we don't find a way to get out.""


 Their radios recorded Rodney's gasp. Then—""Martin! Martin! I think
 I've found something!""


 Martin began to run. After a moment's hesitation, Wass swung in behind
 him.


 ""Here,"" Rodney said, as they came up to him, out of breath. ""Here. See?
 Right here.""


 Three flashlights centered on a dark, metal disk raised a foot or more
 from the floor.


 ""Well, they had hands."" With his torch Wass indicated a small wheel of
 the same metal as everything else in the city, set beside the disk.


 From its design Martin assumed that the disk was meant to be grasped
 and turned. He wondered what precisely they were standing over.


 ""Well, Skipper, are you going to do the honors?""


 Martin kneeled, grasped the wheel. It turned easily—almost too
 easily—rotating the disk as it turned.


 Suddenly, without a sound, the disk rose, like a hatch, on a concealed
 hinge.


 The three men, clad in their suits and helmets, grouped around the
 six-foot opening, shining their torches down into the thing that
 drifted and eddied directly beneath them.


 Rodney's sudden grip on Martin's wrist nearly shattered the bone.
 ""Martin! It's all alive! It's moving!""


 Martin hesitated long enough for a coil to move sinuously up toward the
 opening. Then he spun the wheel and the hatch slammed down.


 He was shaking.
After a time he said, ""Rodney, Wass, it's dust, down there. Remember
 the wind? Air currents are moving it.""


 Rodney sat down on the metal flooring. For a long time he said nothing.
 Then—""It wasn't.... Why did you close the hatch then?""


 Martin did not say he thought the other two would have shot him,
 otherwise. He said merely, ""At first I wasn't sure myself.""


 Rodney stood up, backing away from the closed hatch. He held his gun
 loosely, and his hand shook. ""Then prove it. Open it again.""


 Martin went to the wheel. He noticed Wass was standing behind Rodney
 and he, too, had drawn his gun.


 The hatch rose again at Martin's direction. He stood beside it,
 outlined in the light of two torches.


 For a little while he was alone.


 Then—causing a gasp from Wass, a harsh expletive from Rodney—a
 tenuous, questing alien limb edged through the hatch, curling about
 Martin, sparkling in ten thousand separate particles in the torchlight,
 obscuring the dimly seen backdrop of geometrical processions of strange
 objects.
Martin raised an arm, and the particles swirled in stately, shimmering
 spirals.


 Rodney leaned forward and looked over the edge of the hatch. He said
 nothing. He eyed the sparkling particles swirling about Martin, and
 now, himself.


 ""How deep,"" Wass said, from his safe distance.


 ""We'll have to lower a flashlight,"" Martin answered.


 Rodney, all eagerness to be of assistance now, lowered a rope with a
 torch swinging wildly on the end of it.


 The torch came to rest about thirty feet down. It shone on gently
 rolling mounds of fine, white stuff.


 Martin anchored the rope soundly, and paused, half across the lip
 of the hatch to stare coldly at Wass. ""You'd rather monkey with the
 switches and blow yourself to smithereens?""


 Wass sighed and refused to meet Martin's gaze. Martin looked at him
 disgustedly, and then began to descend the rope, slowly, peering into
 the infinite, sparkling darkness pressing around him. At the bottom
 of the rope he sank to his knees in dust, and then was held even. He
 stamped his feet, and then, as well as he was able, did a standing
 jump. He sank no farther than his knees.


 He sighted a path parallel with the avenue above, toward the nearest
 edge of the city. ""I think we'll be all right,"" he called out, ""as long
 as we avoid the drifts.""


 Rodney began the descent. Looking up, Martin saw Wass above Rodney.


 ""All right, Wass,"" Martin said quietly, as Rodney released the rope and
 sank into the dust.


 ""Not me,"" the answer came back quickly. ""You two fools go your way,
 I'll go mine.""


 ""Wass!""


 There was no answer. The light faded swiftly away from the opening.


 The going was hard. The dust clung like honey to their feet, and eddied
 and swirled about them until the purifying systems in their suits were
 hard-pressed to remove the fine stuff working in at joints and valves.


 ""Are we going straight?"" Rodney asked.


 ""Of course,"" Martin growled.


 There was silence again, the silence of almost-exhausted determination.
 The two men lifted their feet out of the dust, and then laboriously
 plunged forward, to sink again to the knees, repeated the act, times
 without number.


 Then Wass broke his silence, taunting. ""The ship leaves in two hours,
 Martin. Two hours. Hear me, Rodney?""


 Martin pulled his left foot from the sand and growled deep in his
 throat. Ahead, through the confusing patterns of the sparkling dust,
 his flashlight gleamed against metal. He grabbed Rodney's arm, pointed.


 A grate.


 Rodney stared. ""Wass!"" he shouted. ""We've found a way out!""


 Their radios recorded Wass' laughter. ""I'm at the switchboard now,
 Martin. I—""


 There was a tinkle of breaking glass, breaking faceplate.


 The grate groaned upward and stopped.


 Wass babbled incoherently into the radio for a moment, and then he
 began to scream.


 Martin switched off his radio, sick.


 He turned it on again when they reached the opening in the metal wall.
 ""Well?""


 ""I've been trying to get you,"" Rodney said, frantically. ""Why didn't
 you answer?""


 ""We couldn't do anything for him.""


 Rodney's face was white and drawn. ""But he did this for us.""


 ""So he did,"" Martin said, very quietly.


 Rodney said nothing.


 Then Martin said, ""Did you listen until the end?""


 Rodney nodded, jerkily. ""He pulled three more switches. I couldn't
 understand it all. But—Martin, dying alone like that in a place like
 this—!""


 Martin crawled into the circular pipe behind the grate. It tilted up
 toward the surface. ""Come on, Rodney. Last lap.""


 An hour later they surfaced about two hundred yards away from the
 edge of the city. Behind them the black pile rose, the dome of force
 shimmering, almost invisible, about it.


 Ahead of them were the other two scoutships from the mother ship.
 Martin called out faintly, pulling Rodney out of the pipe. Crew members
 standing by the scoutships, and at the edge of the city, began to run
 toward them.


 ""Radio picked you up as soon as you entered the pipe,"" someone said. It
 was the last thing Martin heard before he collapsed.

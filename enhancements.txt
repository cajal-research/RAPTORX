Improve dataset generation:
    - Use gpt to generate different questions using a single prompt. 
    - Extract questions from random parts of the text. Combine chunks to extract questions, etc
    - etc 

Tree improval algorithm:
    - Explicit:
        - Set of questions that led the system to diverge.
        - We cluster the questions. Then, we extract a summary for each cluster.
        - We merge all the summaries with the node summary where divergence was detected.
        - We compute the new embedding and update the tree. 
        - Make sure that there will be no divergence in child nodes down until the right leaf node.
    - Implicit:
        - Improve existing algorithm.
        - Use clustering. 
        - Propagate changes.
        - Tune hyperparameters.
